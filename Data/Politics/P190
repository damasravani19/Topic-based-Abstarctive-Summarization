Even Latino Republicans don't want the GOP to block Obama's immigration plan
  According to a   from Latino pollster Latino Decisions, an overwhelming 89 percent of Latino voters support President Obama's new executive actions. That's an even higher level of support than Latino voters showed for Obama's first executive relief program for unauthorized immigrants (the more limited Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program), even though the DACA program was more popular among all voters than the new plan appears to be. And 80 percent of Latino voters say they'll oppose any attempt by Republicans to block Obama's executive actions. That's not just a reflection of the fact that Latino voters lean Democratic — 60 percent of Latino  say they'd oppose Republican moves to stop Obama's plan from going into effect. That's a very worrisome result for any Republicans who are trying to appeal to their conservative base in 2015, while bringing out the rest of the party — not to mention expanding the party's appeal to Latinos — in 2016.

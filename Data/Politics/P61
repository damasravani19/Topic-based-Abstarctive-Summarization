Itâ€™s not crazy for Mitt Romney to run for president again
Mitt Romney has effectively been running for president since his only successful election to a political office — the Massachusetts governorship — back in 2002. That's roughly a decade spent pursuing the White House. Now, a new report by the Washington Examiner's Byron York   Romney is seriously thinking of trying again. Pundits are mocking the return of Romney's ambitions. But given how the Republican 2016 field is shaping up, where Romney's poll numbers are, and the advantages he brings as a former nominee, Romney 2016 isn't being taken as seriously as it deserves to be.

You have to submit yourself to a nearly two-year long crucible where every single word and gesture you make is scrutinized, by both the media and political opponents seeking to destroy you. But having run for the nomination in 2008 and having won it in 2012, Romney is very much used to this. In contrast, e Another benefit of Romney's past runs is that he's already been heavily scrutinized by opposition researchers. Potentially damaging incidents in his past have already been dug up and aired to voters. Similar attacks on his Bain background would surely be made again, but they'd be old news and would get less attention.

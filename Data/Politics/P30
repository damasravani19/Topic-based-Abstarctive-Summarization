Air conditioning didn't just change America â€” it also changed Congress
One reader emailed me with an interesting point about my   with Salvatore Basile about his book on how air conditioning changed America forever: Noted, reader. Duly noted. (For what it's worth, Basile's book actually spends a fair chunk of pages talking about the struggles of trying to cool the nation's capital, which unfortunately didn't make it into my  . It includes such drama as President Taft installing an early Oval Office cooling system, which needed to be fed a ton of ice a day. Then President Wilson ripped it out after news of the pricey ice bills became public.) Get our newsletter in your inbox twice a week.

Sarah Palin and Democrats support the same candidate for Alaska governor
Former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin doesn't agree with Democrats on very much. But on the question of who should become her state's next governor, she's come to a surprising consensus with her one-time rivals — she's endorsed independent candidate Bill Walker and his Democratic running mate, and   a campaign event for them in late October. The odd Alaska race resembles the Kansas Senate contest somewhat. It pits    
 Palin with Bill Walker (far right) and Byron Mallott (far left). (Bill Walker for Alaska Governor) It may seem odd that Palin is supporting Walker instead of Parnell — particularly because Parnell was Palin's own lieutenant governor, and succeeded her when she resigned in 2009. However, once in office, Parnell repealed Palin's biggest legislative accomplishment — a tax increase on the state's oil and gas industry. Get our newsletter in your inbox twice a week.

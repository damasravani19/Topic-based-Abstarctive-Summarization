How Barack Obama is expanding presidential power â€” and what it means for the future
On a hot day in late July, members of the House of Representatives took to the chamber's floor to make a momentous decision: whether to file an unprecedented lawsuit against the president of the United States. The charge was electric. President Obama, they said, had violated his constitutional duty to faithfully execute the law. When the voting closed, the House was 225 to 201 in favor of filing suit. All but 5 Republicans voted in favor — those opposed believed the lawsuit didn't go far enough. Speaker John Boehner chided the Democrats: "Are you willing to let any president choose what laws to execute and what laws to change?" The substance of the lawsuit was soaked in irony: Republicans, taking a break from trying to repeal Obamacare wholesale, were now suing Obama for not implementing the law fast enough. They held that when the administration   the law's employer mandate last year, it violated congressional will — and the president's own oath to uphold and enforce the laws of the United States. The lawsuit was limited to the delay of the employer mandate because Boehner's lawyers believed the narrow charge had the best chance of success in the courts. But House Republicans made clear they believed Obama's overreach was far broader. It was a charge that, a few short years before, would have sounded perfectly natural coming from Senator Barack Obama. "I taught constitutional law for 10  years," Obama   in March 2008. "I take the Constitution very seriously. The biggest problems that we're facing right now have to do with George Bush trying to bring more and more power into the executive branch and not go through Congress at all. And that's what I intend to reverse when I'm president of the United States of America." But interviews with academic, legal, and policy experts make clear Obama has done little to roll back Bush's expansion of executive power — and that, instead, he's added a few innovations of his own.

They point to   showing the president is issuing executive orders at the lowest rate of any president in the past century. But the raw number reveals little — a single executive order can be extremely consequential, or practically meaningless.  In the foreign policy and security realm, Obama has continued many of Bush's most controversial programs — but those actions, like controversial NSA surveillance programs and detention powers, have since been authorized by statute.

By the year 2014, the law states, 100 percent of every school's students would have to score as proficient in reading and math on state tests. Schools where this didn't occur for two years would be marked as underperforming and face serious sanctions. the Secretary could waive the "100 percent proficiency" requirement, and save states from the penalties. But the administration went further than simply waiving the requirements. Inspire Several experts agreed that the waivers alone would have been unremarkable, but that Obama using them to force policy reforms with no basis in the law is something new. But it's also important to note that Obama isn't asserting any new formal powers here.

The president spoke for several minutes about how the time had come for Congress to finish the job. But as he neared the end of his speech, he was   by an activist in the audience. "Mr. President, please use your executive order to halt deportations for all 11.5 [million] undocumented immigrants in this country right now," said Ju Hong, himself an   whose Korean parents had come to the US 12 years ago, but overstayed a tourist visa. "We agree that we need to pass comprehensive immigration reform. At the same time, you have a power to stop deportations for all—" "Actually, I don't," Obama said. As activists in the crowd chanted "Stop deportations! Stop deportations!" Obama quieted them down, and when security tried to escort them out, he said they could stay. "If in fact I could solve all these problems without passing laws in Congress, then I would do so," he said. "But we're also a nation of laws." Obama's response left a lot out. While he's always maintained that he can't simply stop all deportations, as Hong urged, he had stopped them for hundreds of thousands of people just the previous year.   Reihan Salam of National Review Now, Obama is planning a new series of executive actions that will go even further in deferring the deportation of many more unauthorized immigrants — though the administration has not said quite how far. Advocates are saying the expansion could apply to as many as 5 million people — nearly half of the entire unauthorized population. But it could also be much narrower, for instance, granting temporary legal status to just parents of DACA beneficiaries. Though the White House recently announced that no action would be taken before November's elections, they've said an announcement would take place soon afterward. "Obviously anything we do will come under intense legal scrutiny," a White House official told me. "So we don't shrug off the responsibility to make sure that it's within the confines of the law, and to be ready to explain how it is." However, the true controversy will likely be political rather than legal. It's widely believed on the right that Obama's DACA program helped cause this year's   from Central America. Even Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL), who co-authored the Senate's bipartisan immigration reform bill,   that DACA "sent a message to invite people to come." Opposition to DACA is now widespread within the party, and this summer's Congressional business ended with House Republicans overwhelmingly   to end the program. Rep. Steve King (R-IA)   that if Obama expands deferred action, impeachment hearings should begin "immediately." But Obama argues that he is using executive authority to ameliorate a crisis that Congress refuses to fix.  ( ) Several of the scholars I interviewed referred to presidential power as if it were a construction project that nearly all presidents collaborate on and contribute to. Every time a president claims a new power, another brick is laid down. Some presidents build entire wings. Others attempt to construct an addition, but see it demolished by Congress. Overall, though, the building grows larger and larger over the years. "This has been a bipartisan project of building precedent upon precedent," says Bruce Ackerman, the Yale Law professor. When Obama's administration is asked why it believes it has the authority to take a certain executive action, it often cites a list of precedents — similar actions taken by past administrations. Yet these precedents are usually more limited and less consequential than the proposal at hand.

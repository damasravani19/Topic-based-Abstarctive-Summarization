Obama has a plan for ISIS in Syria. Itâ€™s the opposite of his old plan.
In his Wednesday night address debuting America's new war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria ( ), President Obama is going to totally reverse his administration's longstanding Syria policy. It won't be billed as such, of course, but we know what's coming. Since the war's outbreak in late 2011, Obama has resisted both airstrikes in Syria and any major effort to arm-and-train the moderate Syrian rebels. But   of the President's speech say those two measures — a   and   — are at the heart of his new policy for countering and eventually defeating ISIS in Syria. Why the flip-flop? The obvious answer is that ISIS has gotten stronger, so the administration has decided it needs to use more force against the group. That's part of it. But, to a certain extent, the administration's policy is as much an ad-hoc response to events as it is about a rational assessment of what the US can do to defeat ISIS. The rapid growth of ISIS since June has forced Obama into a policy he's long believed would fail.

According to the Wall Street Journal, the late June plan to arm Syrian rebels was a   to the crisis in Iraq. ISIS was using Syria as a launching pad for its move into Iraq, so the group needed to be countered in both countries if it was to be countered at all. Then, in August, ISIS launched a significant offensive against Iraqi Kurdistan. The administration saw Kurdistan as a stable oasis in chaotic northern Iraq, and the fact that ISIS was making inroads there terrified them. So they launched airstrikes to roll back ISIS's gains, which quickly expanded to airstrikes supporting both Iraqi government and Kurdish forces. The US military effort was, for a time, limited to Iraq. But ISIS's brutal slaughter of two American journalists,  , was the last straw. ISIS   the murders were punishment for America's bombing campaign in Iraq. The administration was furious.  on  Both Secretary of State John Kerry and Martin Dempsey, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, said ISIS must be destroyed. Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel called them an "imminent threat to every interest we had." Vice President Biden pledged to "follow them to the gates of hell." And Obama himself   that his policy was to "destroy and degrade" the group. Once the administration decided to destroy ISIS, escalation in Syria became a fait accompli. It's obviously impossible to eliminate ISIS without taking it on in both Iraq and Syria. Obama — correctly — believes airstrikes alone can't destroy ISIS without local allies on the ground capable of taking and holding ISIS positions. Since the administration can't really coordinate with ISIS's other enemies — al-Qaeda in Syria or Bashar al-Assad's murderous government — the only option left are the so-called moderate rebels. So the only policy that has even a theoretical chance of accomplishing Obama's new objective in Syria is a combination of bombing ISIS positions and aiding moderate rebels. But that's a policy that the president has, for a long time, said was doomed to failure. Get our newsletter in your inbox twice a week.

In it, Obama walks alongside Amelia Boynton Robinson,  , Rep. John Lewis, a civil rights activist-turned-congressman, who's  on Bloody Sunday, and others who were brutally attacked by police as they attempted to cross the Edmund Pettus Bridge in their march from Selma to Montgomery to demand voting rights for African-Americans, on March 7, 1965. On Obama's other side, a third generation — his two daughters — are marching, too. They are holding hands with their grandmother, Marian Shields Robinson, and their mom, First Lady Michelle Obama. This photo is especially moving, as Images from the original Bloody Sunday are hard to come by.

This weekend's images will join them. Against the backdrop of ongoing battles over voting rights and a newer focus on racialized policing, they're reminders of how far we've come — and haven't — and that, as Obama said in his   "This is work for all Americans, and not just some. Not just whites. Not just blacks." Get our newsletter in your inbox twice a week.

Report: deportations way down during Obamaâ€™s second term
Deportations have declined significantly since last fall, continuing a two-year trend, according to the  . Citing internal Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) documents, the AP reports that  It's not clear. ICE doesn't release its own numbers to the public anymore until a few months after the end of each fiscal year, and preliminary reports to the press during the fiscal year can be off the mark. Because the AP says it got its information from internal government documents, it's probable that these are the same numbers ICE itself is using. But even then, ICE often goes back and adjusts numbers retroactively — even from one year to the next. The numbers should be taken seriously  — but with a grain of salt.   
 The AP report cites two factors — but there are probably four: In 2010 and 2011, the Department of Homeland Security issued a series of memos instructing agents to focus on certain kinds of unauthorized immigrants — which it called "high-priority" deportations — and try not to deport long-resident unauthorized immigrants and parents of US citizens. Exactly how successful the memos were in protecting "low-priority" immigrants is   (which is why immigrant-rights advocates are pushing for the Obama administration to let immigrants apply directly for protection from deportation, rather than hoping DHS doesn't decide to deport them). But numbers released by ICE in recent years indicate that the overwhelming majority of deportees fall into one of the priority categories. And ICE numbers from last year showed the majority of immigrants were deported from the border region (the 100 miles past the border itself) and not from the interior of the US. The new statistics might indicate that DHS is continuing to target particular groups for deportation — immigrants who are apprehended at or near the border and immigrants who have been convicted of crimes — and avoiding the deportation of longtime residents who haven't committed crimes. Before most immigrants can be deported, they have a right to a hearing in immigration court, where a judge makes sure they're not eligible for legal status. But immigration courts are hugely under-resourced, and it takes   for a case to make it through.  Data shows that the immigration court slowdown is particularly affecting immigrants in the interior, without criminal records — exactly the same immigrants the government isn't supposed to be deporting anyway. Immigrants who are apprehended at the border don't usually go through immigration court. Ac So the government might be putting more energy into deporting immigrants on the border and immigrants who've committed crimes — people they can deport without sending them through the clogged immigration court system. Meanwhile, when immigration agents   try to deport an immigrant who's been living in the US without committing any crimes, the immigrant's getting stuck in a months- or years-long immigration court backlog.   
 Immigrants who are caught at the border continue to get charged in federal criminal court with illegal entry or illegal reentry at high rates. (They're the two  in the entire federal court system.) Once convicted, they're obligated to serve a prison term before being deported. That's another factor that could be slowing down the process. It's almost certain that   of children and families entering the US from Central America this spring and summer, which overwhelmed the government's resources, had  effect on deportations. But it's difficult to say exactly what it was — especially because these numbers only go through July 28. The AP says that it takes longer to deport immigrants from Central America than it does from Mexico, because the government has to arrange plane flights. Another factor is probably that there's a separate legal process for dealing with unaccompanied children, that prevents them from being deported quickly — and that many families are likely seeking asylum in the US, which also entitles them to more due process before they're deported. (There are reports that the government is   for families to get them deported more quickly.) This doesn't mean that immigrants from Mexico, or immigrant adults, aren't still being apprehended while crossing the border. But the government might not have the resources to formally deport those immigrants — they might be getting returned instead, just like immigrants from Mexico were under George W. Bush. It's hard to say — mostly because of the impact of the child and family migrant crisis. The government started making an effort to deport families back to Central America in late July — right when this dataset ends. That could mean that deportations are happening at a faster pace right now than they were when the AP got the numbers. S

But immigrant communities   that the government has really changed — in a survey this summer, over 70 percent of Latinos said that the government wasn't limiting deportations to criminals. Regardless of   who might have benefited from executive action are being deported, millions of immigrants still feel that they're at risk of deportation. The purpose of executive action would be to allow them to apply for a guarantee of protection from deportation for a certain amount of time, to banish that fear.

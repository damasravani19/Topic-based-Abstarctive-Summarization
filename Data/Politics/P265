The longest-serving governor of Massachusetts spends his time picking up Boston's trash
No one likes to live in a dirty, trash-filled city — especially not former Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis. A Boston resident had an incredible run-in with Dukakis a few days ago,   shared:   In which ex-governor and pres nominee Dukakis picks up trash in Boston. Hard to imagine this happing in the Mideast.  
 
 "This morning I befriended a nice old man who was picking up garbage at the train station on his way to work," Sarah E. Godfrey wrote to the  . "What a good citizen you are!" I said. He was grouchy and told me the train stations were always filthy. I agreed, but cringed when he bent down to pick up a food wrapper and what looked like a used napkin. I told him to make sure he washed his hands when he got to work. "That’s what my wife says," he replied. He threw his collection in the trash bin when we got to the top of the stairs, then turned to me and asked, "How many ex-governors do you think go around picking up trash at train stations?" I laughed, and said, "Not many." Then his comment sunk in. I asked if he had, um, actually served as governor of Massachusetts. "Yes, for 12 years!" And that is how I met Michael Dukakis.

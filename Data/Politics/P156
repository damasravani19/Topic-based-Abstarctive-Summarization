I was about to hype up a Scott Walker 2016 run. Then I watched his victory speech.
When it became clear that Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker had   handily  , I was all set to write an article hyping up his prospects to win the GOP  . It seemed to make total sense — he's been elected three times in a blue state, while fighting hard for conservative priorities in a way that's impressed both the GOP's base and its elites. But then I sat down and watched his victory speech from Tuesday night: The very beginning is nice, as Walker thanks God for his win and gets some applause. But it's all downhill from there.  , As many political commentators have pointed out, Walker faces a "Pawlenty problem." That's in reference to Minnesota Governor Tim Pawlenty, who seemed on paper to be a perfectly good 2012 nominee for Republicans. The 2016 GOP field could be much more crowded with formidable figures. Chris Christie and Ted Cruz both suck all the oxygen out of whichever room they're in. Marco Rubio resembles Barack Obama in being young, talented, and a potential historic demographic first.  Walker's problem will be figuring out how to get anyone to pay attention to him.  This problem certainly doesn't doom Walker's chances. Every candidate will have a weakness in some area, and uncharismatic candidates like Al Gore and John Kerry have certainly managed to win presidential nominations before. But if Walker was a more compelling speaker who manufactured YouTube-ready sound bites like Chris Christie does, he'd probably already be the GOP frontrunner. As it is, if he does run, he'll definitely have to spend a lot of time in debate prep.   Get our newsletter in your inbox twice a week.

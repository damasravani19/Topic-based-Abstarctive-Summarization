Map: The poorest member of Congress in each state
Last month, we showed you the   in each state. But not all of our senators and representatives are multimillionaires — far from it ( ): CQ Roll Call used financial disclosure forms to calculate the minimum net worth of every member — check out  . We've mapped out the poorest member of Congress from each state, according to their estimates. However, there are a few important things that these calculations leave out. Members of Congress also have to disclose a range for how much each of their assets and liabilities are worth, rather than an exact amount. So for instance, Rep. David Valadao (R-CA), who's ranked as the poorest member of Congress here, actually   one asset (Valadao Dairy) and five liabilities (credit lines and real estate financing) that are each worth between $1,000,001 and $5,000,000, in addition to a few smaller items. So though CQ Roll Call takes the lower estimates for all of these and concludes Valadao is $3.7 million underwater, his true net worth could actually be positive, or much more hugely negative. ( The only members here with an estimated net worth of less than negative $1 million are Valadao and Rep. Alcee Hastings (D-FL), who still owes   from a scandal during his tenure as a federal judge in the 1980s (he was tried for bribery, acquitted, but then impeached and removed from office by Congress, before being elected to Congress himself).

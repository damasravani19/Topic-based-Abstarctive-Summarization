The Clean Power Plan is a big deal. But itâ€™s only one piece of Obamaâ€™s climate agenda.
On Monday afternoon, the Obama administration , a major new EPA rule that aims to cut carbon dioxide emissions from the nation's electric power plants. A bunch of media outlets are referring to this as "Obama's climate plan." But that's not quite right. More precisely, this rule is just one piece of   to reduce US greenhouse gas emissions over the next decade. The Clean Power Plan is certainly a significant component, but it isn't even expected to account for a majority of the cuts Obama's envisioning. So keep an eye on all those other rules and policies, as well. Broadly speaking, President Obama's climate change plan boils down to a simple set of numbers. The United States is currently taking part   to address global warming. And as part of those talks, the Obama administration has vowed that US greenhouse gas emissions will decline 26 to 28 percent below 2005 levels by 2025: That's not an easy task. As of 2013, US greenhouse gas emissions   just 8.5 percent below 2005 levels, a drop that largely happened due to the recession, to a natural gas boom that pushed out dirtier coal power, and to a rise in vehicle efficiency. But that's still not enough. And more recently, emissions have started creeping up again. Plus, Congress has no interest in passing climate legislation of any sort. So to push down emissions even further, the Obama administration has been issuing an   through the EPA and other executive-branch agencies. A partial list includes: None of the above has gone through Congress — most of it is being done under legal authority that the Supreme Court granted the EPA back in 2007. You can also throw in other policies enacted throughout Obama's presidency that have helped reshape the energy landscape and curtail emissions. There were the expanded tax credits for wind and solar power in the 2009 stimulus bill. The Energy Department has been setting   for household appliances. The EPA crafted a rule  , which has pushed utilities to retire many of their oldest, dirtiest coal plants. Meanwhile, states like California and New York have conducted their own policies to boost clean energy and curtail emissions. It all adds up. Now, on top of all that, the EPA is finalizing its Clean Power Plan, which will directly address carbon dioxide emissions from existing power plants. This is certainly one of the more ambitious climate rules the Obama administration has done, given that power plants  . And the Clean Power Plan is expected to have a serious impact on the electricity sector, reducing power plant emissions   from today's levels by 2030. But in the grand scheme of things, that amounts to a 6 percentage point cut in US greenhouse gases — or about one-quarter of the emission cuts necessary to hit Obama's 2025 climate goal. Significant? Yes. The whole story? No. Not by itself, no. Even Obama's broader climate plan is only one piece of an even bigger global effort. And that global plan has a whole lot of moving parts. First, the United States actually needs to hit those 2025 targets — and that's not yet guaranteed, even with the Clean Power Plan in place. A recent   from the World Resources Institute suggests that the US will need either more climate policies from Congress (which looks unlikely right now) or new regulations from the next president. Those additional rules could involve things like emissions cuts from refineries, cement plants, airplanes, and so on, as well as strengthening some of Obama's existing policies. So  . Second, other countries would have to take their own climate measures. After all, the United States only accounts for about 17 percent of global emissions. We certainly can't solve anything by ourselves. The Obama administration is hoping that its recent efforts — including the Clean Power Plan — will spur other countries to respond in kind. Over the past year, for instance, China and Brazil   their own pledges for curbing emissions. The ultimate goal is for all these proposals   at UN talks in Paris in December 2015. But ultimately, the whole world will need to step up its climate ambitions if we want to avoid significant temperature increases. The International Energy Agency   that even if you take every nation's current climate pledges seriously, we're still on pace for around 3°C of warming by 2100 — well above the 2°C limit that most countries have set as a goal. Everyone needs to do more. So that's where the Clean Power Plan fits in the broader scheme of things. It's a major policy, yes, but stabilizing global temperatures and "fixing" climate change will require a lot of moving parts. Get our newsletter in your inbox twice a week.

One reason politicians cater to the rich â€” they're more likely to vote
Today when you hear anyone say this election is   (and      ), take a minute to consider who exactly is turning out for elections — or, more importantly, who   turning out.

Why is there this class divide in who votes? There are all sorts of reasons — some people can't get out of work to vote, for example, and the   of unionization may have disconnected many Americans from politics. In an   on this topic earlier this year, Daniel Weeks wrote at the Atlantic that black and Hispanic Americans, who are   to live in poverty than whites, are also less likely to have the correct IDs. Really, more affluent Americans are more likely than the poorest Americans to participate in democracy in all kinds of ways, whether it's via voting or protests or rallies. And of course, as Nick Carnes   on Vox earlier this year, the rich both overwhelmingly occupy the halls of Congress (and the Supreme Court and the White House) and pay to make sure their chosen candidates get elected And it matters in a way that's fundamental to our democracy. What it means is a representative democracy that's in danger of becoming far less representative of its population.

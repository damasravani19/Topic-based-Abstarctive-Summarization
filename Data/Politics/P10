5 reasons politics doesn't fix inequality
One of the most longstanding hopes (on the left) and fears (on the right) about democratic politics is that voters of modest means will use their electoral weight to level the economic playing field. In a market economy, the median voter's income will invariably be below the national average creating an apparently compelling opportunity for a politics of redistribution. This makes the sustained increase in income inequality in the United States and other developed countries a bit of a puzzle. One common suggestion,   by Eduardo Porter in  , is ignorance. Voters "don't grasp how deep inequality is."

<![endif] But while Americans understanding of economic trends is certainly imperfect, the data suggest that the broad trends are known to the population. Nathan Kelly and Peter Enns, for instance,   that when asked to compare the ratio of the highest paid occupation and the lowest, Americans at the bottom of the income distribution do believe inequality is high and rising. In 1987, Americans as reported that the highest-paid occupation took home 20 times what the lowest paid occupation did - by 2000, they thought the gap had grown to 74 times. report that they are either "somewhat" or "very" dissatisfied with the income and wealth distribution in the U.S. If ignorance doesn't explain inaction, what does?

<![endif] They find that redistribution is lower then when actual social mobility is but also lower where perceived mobility is higher. Even if voters perceive the level of inequality correctly, their tendency to overstate the level of mobility can undermine support for redistribution. In another study Alberto Alesina and Eliana La Ferrara   that, Americans who believe that American society offers equal opportunity ( ) are more likely to oppose redistribution. Using data from 33 democracies, Elvire Guillaud   that those who believe they have experienced downward mobility in the past decade areÂ  32% more likely to support redistribution. A     literature now supports this thesis. Enns and Kelly find, rather counterintuitively, that when "inequality in America rises, the public responds with increased conservative sentiment." That is, higher inequality leads to less demand for redistribution. This is perhaps because as society becomes less equal, its members have less in common and find it less congenial to act in solidarity. Bo Rothstein and Eric Uslaner  , "the best policy response to growing inequality is to enact universalistic social welfare programs. However, the social strains stemming from increased inequality make it almost impossible to enact such policies."

Many Americans support redistributive programs like the minimum wage and support for the idea that hard work leads to success has  . A further important reason for the lack of political response to inequality relates to the structure of American political institutions, which fail to translate the desires of less-advantaged Americans for more redistribution into actual policy change.

<![endif] More simply, lower-income Americans  . William Franko, Nathan Kelly and Christopher Witko   that states with lower turnout inequality also have lower income inequality. Elsewhere, Franko   that states with wider turnout gaps between the rich and poor are less likely to pass minimum-wage increases, have weaker anti-predatory-lending policies and have less generous health insurance programs for children in low-income families. Kim Hill, Jan Leighley and Angela Hilton-Andersson  , "an enduring relationship between the degree of mobilization of lower-class voters and the generosity of welfare benefits." Worryingly, Frederick Solt  , "citizens of states with greater income inequality are less likely to vote and that income inequality increases income bias in the electorate." That is, as inequality increases, the poor are less likely to turn out, further exacerbating inequality. The decline of labor unions has decreased the political importance of poor voters, because unions were an important "get-out-the-vote" machine. A recent study by Jan Leighley and Jonathan Nagler   that the decline in union strength has reduced low-income and middle-income turnout. But labor's influence (or lack thereof) is also important when the voting is done.

<![endif] In other words, a massive public education campaign about the extent of income inequality is neither necessary nor sufficient to achieve the kind of redistributive policies liberals favor. The real obstacles to policy action on inequality are more deeply ingrained in the structure of American politics, demographics, and interest group coalitions. Insofar as there is a role for better information to play, it likely relates not to inequality but to   which remains widely misperceived and is a potent driver of feelings about the justice of economic policy. As John Steinbeck noted, "Socialism never took root in America because the poor see themselves not as an exploited proletariat but as temporarily embarrassed millionaires." Stronger unions, more lower income voter turnout and policies to reduce the corrupting influence of money on the political process would all work to reduce inequality. It will take political mobilization, not simply voter education to achieve change. The wonks have interpreted the world; the point, however, is to change it.

The 48 cities where Uber is cutting prices,http://www.vox.com/2015/1/9/7519237/the-48-cities-where-uber-is-cutting-prices,Uber says it's so confident the price cuts will boost demand that it's guaranteeing drivers' hourly earnings.,"<p>Uber and Lyft have been in a vicious price war for the past year. On Thursday, Uber  fired the latest salvo, <a href=""http://blog.uber.com/PriceCut2015"">announcing price cuts</a> in 48 markets. Cities where customers will enjoy lower fares include Atlanta, Denver, Dallas, Miami, and Detroit:</p> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""2918456"" alt=""uber_PriceCuts_BlogInfographic-02.0.png"" src=""https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2918456/uber_PriceCuts_BlogInfographic-02.0.png""></p> \n<p> </p> \n<p class=""caption"">(Uber)</p> \n<p> </p> \n<p>The development will be cheered by passengers in these cities, but the announcement could cause consternation among drivers worried that their already modest incomes will take a hit. But Uber insists that lower fares are a win-win for everyone. The company says that cheaper fares will attract more customers, which will allow drivers to make more money per hour. In fact, Uber says it's so confident drivers will earn more that it's offering drivers a minimum-earnings guarantee.</p> \n<p>Customers are ""very sensitive to price,"" says Andrew Macdonald, Uber's regional manager for the central part of the United States. ""The lower you bring the price, the better the economic case for riders to leave their car at home.""</p> \n<h3>A guarantee to drivers</h3> \n<p>In Denver, for example, Uber is guaranteeing that drivers will make at least $18 per hour during periods of regular demand and $24 per hour on Friday and Saturday evenings. Here's the chart Uber has emailed to its Denver drivers:</p> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""2918482"" alt=""Screen_Shot_2015-01-08_at_9.57.26_PM.0.png"" src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2918482/Screen_Shot_2015-01-08_at_9.57.26_PM.0.png""></p> \n<p> </p> \n<p class=""caption"">(Uber)</p> \n<p> </p> \n<p>These cuts in smaller markets follow aggressive price-cutting Uber did in its largest markets last year. In Chicago, for instance, Uber did two rounds of price cuts in 2014. Uber says its drivers actually made more as a result. Between December 2013 and December 2014 the average cost of an Uber trip fell from $14.25 to $11. Yet the number of trips per hour rose by 45 percent during that same period. As a result, the average hourly earnings of drivers rose from $19.10 to $21.10. Uber says that fare cuts in New York produced a <a href=""http://blog.uber.com/nyc-three-septembers-uberX"">similar result</a>.</p> \n<p>Uber wants to replicate that experience across the country.</p> \n<p>The price cuts and guarantee amounts vary from city to city. In San Diego, Uber is cutting fares 20 percent and guaranteeing drivers they can make at least $20 per hour during regular hours and $26 per hour during peak periods. Kansas City customers will enjoy fare cuts of 30 percent, while drivers will make at least $10 per hour during regular hours and $20 per hour during peak periods.</p> \n<p><span>Macdonald says Uber won't be guaranteeing driver earnings forever. ""In some cities, you may see driver productivity jump so quickly that in four weeks they're already doing 30 percent more trips per hour."" Macdonald says that at that point Uber would likely eliminate the guarantee because drivers were making plenty of money without it.</span></p> \n<p>On the other hand, if demand doesn't increase enough to justify the cuts, Macdonald says Uber might reverse the price cuts. But he doesn't expect that to happen very often. ""This is a formula that we know works,"" he says.</p> \n<h3>A tricky situation for Lyft</h3> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""2918490"" alt=""450502218__4_.0.jpg"" src=""https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2918490/450502218__4_.0.jpg""></p> \n<p>The economic theory behind Uber's move is simple: everyone wins when drivers spend more time driving and less time waiting around. Uber argues price cuts will help accomplish that by attracting more riders. <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/12/17/7402311/lyft-driver-pay"">My own experience</a> driving for Lyft certainly confirmed that it's better for drivers when there are lots of passengers.</p> \n<p>A larger company like Uber has an inherent advantage in this kind of market, because its deeper pool of customers allows it to offer drivers a more consistent flow of passengers. Also, a higher density of both passengers and drivers reduces average pickup times, simultaneously raising customer satisfaction and driver productivity.</p> \n<p>All this means that guaranteeing drivers' incomes may cost Uber less, per driver, than it would for a smaller company like Lyft. When I drove for Lyft, I was guaranteed that I'd make at least $30 per hour, but I only earned about $12 per hour from passengers. Lyft wound up paying me the rest out of its own pocket. Uber isn't quite offering drivers $30 per hour, but it's offering more than I made as a Washington DC Lyft driver in cities (like Denver and San Diego) where the cost of living is lower.</p> \n<p>Perhaps Uber's larger network means drivers will be able to earn more than the amounts Uber is promising them. If not, Uber can easily absorb the losses. Last year, the company <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/12/4/7336433/uber-worth-"">raised a mind-boggling $2.4 billion</a> from investors, nearly 10 times the <a href=""http://techcrunch.com/2014/04/02/lyft-250m/"">$250 million Lyft raised</a> in early 2014. With all that cash in the bank, Uber can afford to cut prices aggressively without worrying about short-term profitability.</p> \n<p>Will Lyft respond with price cuts of its own? I've emailed Lyft for comment, and will update the story if they respond.</p>",Business & Finance

2014 is the year American austerity came to an end,http://www.vox.com/2015/1/9/7520599/austerity-2014,The unknown political and economic story of the year.,"<p>2014 is the year that austerity began to come to an end to the United States, with government spending accelerating sharply across the first three quarters of the year. This doesn't comport particularly well with anyone's political narratives, but it's there plain as day in the data on total government spending:</p> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""2919408"" alt=""fredgraph-1.0.0.png"" src=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2919408/fredgraph-1.0.0.png""></p> \n<p><span>Government spending really surged in 2009 thanks to the federal stimulus bill. But starting in 2010, aspects of the stimulus started to fade out and budget cuts made in state and local government were pulling in the opposite direction. Then we had a three-year period in 2011, 2012, and 2013 when total spending in the United States was basically flat. You had state and local cutbacks, and then, just as state and local budgets were getting in better shape, you had sequestration cuts taking effect.</span></p> \n<p>But now in 2014, government spending is surging again. Not back up to Bush-era levels, but up off the floor from the prime austerity level.</p> \n<p>So what's going on here? Well even though sequestration is still in effect, there's no <em>new</em> sequestration cuts happenings. Meanwhile, the number of old people collecting Social Security and Medicare checks keeps steadily rising and thanks to Obamacare a bunch of people got signed up for Medicaid in 2014. Meanwhile, state and local budgets are generally improving.</p>",Business & Finance
3D cameras are about to go mainstream. Here's why that's a big deal.,http://www.vox.com/2015/1/9/7520967/intel-realsense-3d-camera,"Intel's RealSense cameras allow computers to see the world in three dimensions, enabling computers to understand the world around them.","<p>We're used to our gadgets being passive objects. They respond to typed or tapped commands, but we don't expect them to be aware of their surroundings.</p> \n<p>Announcements and demonstrations at this week's Computer Electronics Show make it clear that that's going to change, and soon. As our devices have more and better sensors, they're going to be increasingly aware of the world around them, and will interact with the world and with us in more sophisticated ways.</p> \n<p>Tablets and smartphones won't just take pictures, they'll be able to identify objects in a shot and judge their size and distance. Computers won't just respond to taps on a keyboard or touchscreen, they'll respond to gestures, voice commands, and the motion of people around a room. And vehicles — both on the ground and in the air — will increasingly understand the world around them and react intelligently to obstacles. This will mean smartphones that can take precise size measurements with a single click, personal drones that can take breathtaking aerial shots, and dramatically safer cars.</p> \n<h3>Computer vision is going 3D</h3> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2919850/106537289.0.jpg"" alt=""106537289.0.jpg"" data-chorus-asset-id=""2919850""></p> \n<p> </p> \n<p class=""caption"">The original Kinect sensor, released in 2010, was groundbreaking.  (Joe Raedle/Getty Images)</p> \n<p>When we look at the world around us, our brains automatically build a 3D model of our surroundings. They identify objects like people, animals, and pieces of furniture and figure out how  big and far away they are. The cameras on our digital devices don't do that — they just take flat, 2-dimensional images. But that's going to change soon.</p> \n<p>Microsoft has been a big innovator in this area. The company <a href=""http://arstechnica.com/gaming/2010/07/kinect-official-150-new-360-hardware-coming-august-3/"">introduced the Kinect sensor</a> for Xbox in 2010. It combines a traditional camera with an infrared range-finding sensor to capture images with depth.</p> \n<p>Microsoft built the Kinect to allow a new generation of games that use gestures instead of  a traditional controller. But the technology has proven to have other applications too. It has <a href=""http://www.polygon.com/2013/5/30/4380636/xbox-one-new-kinect-ai-learning-cornell-robotics-scientist"">sparked a renaissance</a> in the robotics community. Kinect's cheap hardware and powerful software makes it superior to a lot of the industrial-grade sensors researchers had been using previously. Kinect has been used by robotics researchers at <a href=""http://www.neowin.net/news/nasa-uses-microsofts-kinect-for-windows-v2-for-robotic-research"">NASA</a>, the <a href=""http://www.wired.com/2011/06/mf_kinect/all/"">University of California at Berkeley</a>, <a href=""http://www.digitalartsonline.co.uk/news/hacking-maker/disney-research-hacks-kinect-let-robot-juggle-catch/"">Disney</a>, and many other places.</p> \n<p>Kinect is cheaper than a lot of other sensors, but it's not cheap enough to become truly ubiquitous. Five years after Kinect was announced, a standalone sensor still costs at least $150.</p> \n<p>Intel is trying to one-up Microsoft by building Kinect-like 3D sensors that are small and cheap enough to integrate into mobile devices. Intel <a href=""http://www.theverge.com/2014/1/6/5281120/kinect-like-cameras-are-coming-to-your-next-laptop-or-tablet"">announced the technology</a>, dubbed RealSense, last year. And it has been aggressively promoting it at CES this week.</p> \n<p>Intel has been vague about how much RealSense hardware costs, since they're trying to sell to gadget makers such as Samsung and LG rather than the general public. But the company claims they'll be cheap enough to reach a mass market (for example, the first product to incorporate a RealSense camera, a Dell tablet, costs $400). If things go according to Intel's plan, within a few years all of our tablets and laptops, and perhaps even our smartphones, will have fancy 3D cameras instead of boring old 2D ones.</p> \n<h3>Good software makes 3D cameras more powerful</h3> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2919866/136698928.0.jpg"" alt=""136698928.0.jpg"" data-chorus-asset-id=""2919866""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">People play a Kinect game at CES in 2012. (David Becker/Getty Images)</p> \n<p>Being able to capture 3D images is pretty cool in its own right — Intel says you'll be able to turn everyday objects digital models suitable for 3D printing, for example. <span>But what makes technologies like the Kinect and RealSense really powerful is software that helps app developers recognize the people and objects in a scene.</span></p> \n<p>With a RealSense-equipped tablet, you can take a photo of a room and have it automatically compute the size of objects in the shot. You'll be able to automatically erase the background from a photo or video or apply different effects to the foreground and background.</p> \n<p>Both platforms also include software to track the movements of people and understand their gestures. <a href=""http://www.theverge.com/2013/9/30/4786038/xbox-one-kinect-sensor-detects-two-people-talking"">Kinect software</a>, for example, can ""track thumbs, 25 joints of up to six people, and heart rates by scanning a face."" It can also understand two people talking at the same time.</p> \n<p><span>Microsoft and Intel envision a future where people control their computers using gestures rather than keyboards or touchscreens. It's not clear that this is something PC users actually want — keyboards and mice are pretty efficient input methods. But it could be useful in a lot of other situations.</span></p> \n<p>BMW, for example, is <a href=""http://www.theverge.com/2015/1/6/7499437/bmw-touch-command-tablet-samsung-gestures-ces-2015"">working on technology</a> to let drivers use gestures to control accessories. Right now, BMW is using an ordinary camera, but a RealSense camera could make the gesture-recognition capabilities more sophisticated. Similarly, putting a RealSense camera in home entertainment system could allow people to control their TVs with <em>Minority Report</em>-style gestures instead of a remote control.</p> \n<p>The technology could also have major industrial applications. Mounting RealSense cameras in a warehouse or assembly line could allow a company to track employees and equipment as they move around, turning on lights and equipment as needed and gaining insight into how to improve efficiency.</p> \n<h3>3D sensors in drones and self-driving cars</h3> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2919936/461113152.0.jpg"" alt=""461113152.0.jpg"" data-chorus-asset-id=""2919936""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Intel showed off drones equipped with RealSense cameras at this year's CES show. (Ethan Miller/Getty Images)</p> \n<p>The most important applications for 3D cameras and sensors are for vehicles that navigate the world autonomously. Intel sees this as a major application for RealSense. In his CES keynote, Intel CEO Brian Krzanich demoed a <a href=""http://www.theverge.com/2015/1/6/7505803/intel-realsense-technology-can-make-every-device-self-aware"">drone equipped with six RealSense cameras</a> that was able to navigate around obstacles autonomously. This is a situation where the small size and power consumption of RealSense is important, because there are strict limits on how much weight a drone can carry.</p> \n<p>Another technology being demoed at CES this week shows the potential of the technology. Airdog is a small, camera-equipped drone that can be programmed to follow you around and make a video of your surroundings. Airdog is touting it as a way for outdoorsy types to capture footage of their mountain biking and rock climbing exploits. Right now, users have to manually mark out obstacles so Airdog knows to avoid them. But a 3D camera like RealSense will allow drones to detect and avoid obstacles automatically, allowing users to launch them and then forget about them until they land.</p> \n<p>BMW and Audi both demoed self-driving cars at CES this week. Safety is critical here, so companies developing self-driving cars have been using sensors that are significantly more powerful — and expensive — than RealSense or Kinect. The sensors on Google's early self-driving cars <a href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/google-self-driving-car-sensor-cost-2012-9"">cost hundreds of thousands of dollars</a>.</p> \n<p>These costs are expected to come down as the technology is refined and mass-produced. But sensors suitable for self-driving applications will likely cost thousands of dollars for a while yet. Ford CEO Mark Fields <a href=""http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2015-01-06/ford-ceo-fields-predicts-driverless-cars-on-roads-in-five-years.html"">said this week</a> that self-driving cars will come on the market by the end of the decade. But he said Ford probably wouldn't be the company to make the breakthrough first, because Ford is focused on producing affordable vehicles.</p> \n<p>So this is going to be a big area of technological progress in the coming decade. Hardware companies will be working to improve the performance of 3D sensors while reducing their cost. Meanwhile, companies in Silicon Valley, Detroit, and elsewhere will be developing software that uses these sensors to understand the world. The result will be a proliferation of devices, from tablets to self-driving cars, that understand and interact with the world around them.</p>",Business & Finance

Some rich guys think so.,http://www.vox.com/2015/1/13/7535561/rap-genius-new-yorker,"Genius was started as a rap lyrics site, but it's raised more than $50 million to ""annotate the world.""","<p>On Monday, we <a href=""https://twitter.com/sfj/status/554716696728961024"">learned</a> that Sasha Frere-Jones, the New Yorker's pop-music critic, was leaving the magazine to become executive editor of Genius. The start-up company currently runs a site — previously known as Rap Genius — where fans can annotate rap lyrics and other text.</p> \n<p>This seemed odd at first. Genius is best known for feuding with people like Mark Zuckerberg, not for serious journalism. Recruiting a writer from a respected publication like the New Yorker will help to burnish Genius' public image. But a lot of people are wondering what makes the company so appealing.</p> \n<p>Recently, Genius has been trying to convince people that it's more than just a lyrics site. The company has an ambitious plan — supported by more than $50 million in venture capital — to convince sites across the web to use Genius's annotation technology on their own sites. In theory, that could let users mark up news articles, suggest improvements to recipe sites, and help each other understand great works of literature. If the plan succeeds, it could have a big effect on the web. But that's still a big if.</p> \n<h3>Genius began as a lyrics site</h3> \n<p>Genius is a company with a mission to ""annotate the world."" Previously known as Rap Genius and before that Rap Exegesis, it began as a site that allowed fans of rap music to attach explanatory comments to lines in their favorite songs. In the last couple of years, the site has expanded, first to other genres of music, then to texts of all kinds. Today it looks like this:</p> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""2927806"" alt=""Screen_Shot_2015-01-12_at_1.28.22_PM.0.png"" src=""https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2927806/Screen_Shot_2015-01-12_at_1.28.22_PM.0.png""></p> \n<p>On the left, you see the lyrics of a song — though any other kind of text could appear there. On the right are annotations of the text, supplied by users. These annotations can contain text, images, or videos.</p> \n<p>The company raised $15 million in 2012, and another $40 million last year.</p> \n<h3>The idea behind Genius can be traced back to the web's early days</h3> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""2927816"" alt=""492330789.0.jpg"" src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2927816/492330789.0.jpg""></p> \n<p> </p> \n<p class=""caption"">Marc Andreessen. (Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)</p> \n<p> </p> \n<p>Venture capitalist Marc Andreessen, whose firm Andreessen Horowitz provided the 2012 funding round, <a href=""http://genius.com/Marc-andreessen-why-andreessen-horowitz-is-investing-in-rap-genius-annotated/"">made the case</a> for the company in a 2012 post. Andreessen believes Genius is an opportunity to build one of the web's great missing features: the ability for anyone to annotate information.</p> \n<p>This has been a longtime passion for Andreessen, who co-created Mosaic, one of the first successful web browsers, in 1993. ""It seemed obvious to us that users would want to annotate all text on the web. Our idea was that each web page would be a launchpad for insight and debate about its own contents,"" he <a href=""http://genius.com/Marc-andreessen-why-andreessen-horowitz-is-investing-in-rap-genius-annotated"">wrote</a> in 2012.</p> \n<p>Back at the dawn of the web, Andreessen and his colleagues actually built a technology called ""group annotations"" to support this kind of spontaneous collaboration. However, supporting the technology across the entire web would have required powerful servers, and Andreessen says they didn't have time to build the required infrastructure. So the feature got dropped.</p> \n<p>Now, two decades later, Andreessen wants to bring it back. And he sees Genius as a way to do it. When Genius raised a new $40 million round of funding in 2014, led by Cleveland Cavaliers owner Dan Gilbert, Andreessen Horowitz was among the investors.</p> \n<h3>But Genius is still best-known for its founders' outlandish behavior</h3> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""2927818"" alt=""167839960.0.jpg"" src=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2927818/167839960.0.jpg""></p> \n<p> </p> \n<p class=""caption"">Genius co-founders (from left to right) Tom Lehman, Ilan Zechory, and Mahbod Moghadam are interviewed by TechCrunch's Josh Constine in 2013. (Brian Ach/Getty Images)</p> \n<p> </p> \n<p>Supporters of Genius insist that the site is building a technology that will revolutionize how we experience the web. Yet the site is still better-known for the outlandish antics of its three founders — Tom Lehman, Ilan Zechory, and Mahbod Moghadam <strong> —</strong> who have thrown famously lavish parties, done a lot of drugs, and picked fights with some of the world's most prominent business leaders.</p> \n<p>For example, two years ago Genius co-founder Mahbod Moghadam was at a dinner with Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg and the rapper Nas. He <a href=""http://uncubed.com/2013/02/12/an-interview-with-mahbod-moghadam-of-rap-genius/"">pulled out his smartphone</a> and snapped a picture of the pair. Then, as Moghadam tells the story, he ""went paparazzi and Instagrammed it"" — over the objections of the intensely private Zuckerberg.</p> \n<p>Zuckerberg demanded an apology. In an interview, Moghadam said that ""Zuck can suck my dick."" A couple of weeks later he <a href=""http://betabeat.com/2013/02/rap-genius-cofounder-is-soliciting-diss-tracks-about-warren-buffet-tells-82-year-old-investor-to-suck-his/"">posted a similarly vulgar comment</a> about Warren Buffet from the Rap Genius twitter account.</p> \n<p>Last May, Moghadam went a step too far when he <a href=""http://www.buzzfeed.com/mbvd/rap-genius-cofounder-resigns-after-writing-offensive-comment"">posted the manifesto</a> of Elliot Rodger, whose shooting spree left 6 dead near the UC-Santa Barbara campus. Moghadam annotated the document with approving and misogynistic comments, generating so much controversy that his co-founders and investors forced him to resign.</p> \n<p>Lehman and Zechory insist that the bad-boy image was trumped up to help generate interest in the site. They say they now recognize that they're running a serious site, and starting beefs with random billionaires isn't good for business.</p> \n<h3>And Genius isn't generating any revenue yet</h3> \n<p>Currently, Genius has no revenues and no specific plans to generate revenue. Indeed, New York magazine <a href=""http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2014/12/genius-minus-the-rap.html"">reports</a> that when an engineer was interviewing for a job at Genius, he asked Zechory how the company planned to make money. Zechory laughed.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""right""><span>The strategy worked for Google and Facebook because they were building huge audiences</span></q></p> \n<p>By itself, that's not a big deal. Some of the web's most successful startups, including Google and Facebook, focused on growing their audiences for years before trying to generate revenue.</p> \n<p>But the strategy worked for Google and Facebook because they were building huge audiences. For Genius to succeed, it needs to convince people that there's value in annotating more than just song lyrics.</p> \n<p>So far, there isn't much sign that Genius has the potential to reach vast audiences. Comscore estimates that the site's US audience was 4.3 million unique visitors in November. That's a sizeable audience, but it's hard to see how it could justify valuing the company at hundreds of millions of dollars. According to New York magazine, lyrics still account for the majority of the site's traffic.</p> \n<h3>It won't be easy to convince other websites to adopt Genius' technology</h3> \n<p><img style=""line-height: 28.4624996185303px;"" data-chorus-asset-id=""2927846"" alt=""annotation.0.png"" src=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2927846/annotation.0.png""></p> \n<p> </p> \n<p class=""caption"">(<a href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/auntiep/64900272/in/photolist-6JCAd-fN4z5s-aUtwe-59JVFK-4Npo8P-59P1xL-59NSrL-8XnP2a-8Xnu2D-59K69n-59K68v-8XqJt5-59P1yq-59JktT-5m1fcb-8XqQus-59NSs5-5m1fbQ-5m1oqA-8XnBbi-8XqTz9-8XnuTD-8XqKhh-8Xnxgi-8XnKHD-8XnzC4-8XnCMg-59K694-5m1or3-5kWgKg-8XnJQR-8XnMux-59NSsm-5kWpha-5m1fbo-5m1orG-5kWpgx-9exHjA-5kWgHF-5kWpgt-5kWpgK-8XqLRY-8XqBXA-8XnBX2-8XnyN8-8XnvND-8XqL25-8XqEfS-pGeJ69-7oosAi/"" target=""_blank"">Paula Bailey</a>)</p> \n<p> </p> \n<p>The key to the Genius strategy is getting other sites to adopt its annotation technology. They envision a future where every site on the web — maybe even Vox.com — will let users add Genius-style annotations to their content.</p> \n<p>The site sees YouTube's early growth as a model. One of the key things that distinguished the early YouTube from many other video-sharing sites was the ability to easily embed a YouTube video directly onto any web page.</p> \n<p>But there are a couple of big obstacles. First, it's not obvious that this is a feature that users actually want. After all, lots of websites have comment sections, and the quality of those comments tends to be depressingly low. Will readers like it if comments start appearing in the middle of articles? It doesn't seem very likely.</p> \n<p>Indeed, this idea of user annotations isn't totally new. Gawker, for example, provides users with the ability to add annotations to images on the site. It's an interesting feature, but it doesn't seem to add a lot of value.</p> \n<p>Even if annotation is a feature that users and website operators want, Genius will face a second challenge: convincing sites to use Genius' own technology instead of building their own. Even if many sites become persuaded about the value of user-annotated content, they're likely to have varying design and user experience requirements. Many sites might decide to create their own annotation systems. Open source alternatives will inevitably spring up.</p> \n<p>In short, there's a lot of uncertainty about Genius' ability to deliver on its lofty goals. The company has a proven knack for generating press attention. But it has yet to demonstrate a capacity to create a broadly useful technology platform.</p> \n<p><b>Update:</b> Moghadam responded by email.

In 2014, the value of Iowa cropland slid by 8.9 percent, its fastest decline in 28 years, as the <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/money/agriculture/2014/12/18/iowa-farmland-prices-fall-iowa-state-university/20611703/"">Register</a> reported in December.</p> \n<p>That's happening because commodity prices are plummeting after a meteoric rise in the last few years.

But thanks in part to bumper crops this year, corn prices are falling — and as corn prices go, so go land prices in the upper Midwest.</p> \n<p>Here's a look at that remarkable rise in land values:</p> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2939330/Screen_Shot_2015-01-16_at_11.27.29_AM.0.png"" alt=""Iowa farmland values"" data-chorus-asset-id=""2939330""></p> \n<p>It's certainly true that land prices are still fantastically high by historic standards, but keep in mind that that drop on the far right took place in just one year. The big question now is how much that drop continues. A couple of years ago, it was common to hear fears about another land price bubble, like the one that popped in the <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-12-17/corn-plummeting-spurs-talk-of-80s-u-s-farmland-bust-mortgages.html"">early 1980s</a> and devastated many farmers.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""right"">falling land prices impact a farmers far beyond dragging down their net worth</q></p> \n<p>This is, of course, a story much bigger and more important than any reality show, and far bigger than any farmer's impressive net worth. As land prices fall across Iowa and other parts of the upper Midwest, it hurts farmers, even those who aren't trying to sell their land. And that's because farmers use land to secure loans to grow their operations or buy necessities like machinery. When your land drops in value, so does your ability to grow — or even maintain — your operation.</p> \n<p>Fears of a popping farmland bubble aren't entirely gone — corn prices are at around $3.80 a bushel right now, less than half their <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.farmdoc.illinois.edu/manage/uspricehistory/USPrice.asp"">2012 and 2013 highs</a>. <span>But there's also reason to think there won't be a disastrous slide.

The crazy reason Selma doesn't use the actual words from MLK's speeches,http://www.vox.com/2015/1/13/7540027/selma-copyright-king-speeches,Fears of copyright lawsuits from the famously litigious King estate forced the creators of Selma to paraphrase the civil rights leader rather than quoting him directly.,"<p>There's been a lot of controversy surrounding <i>Selma</i>, the Martin Luther King Jr. biopic that <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-movie-selma-has-a-glaring-historical-inaccuracy/2014/12/26/70ad3ea2-8aa4-11e4-a085-34e9b9f09a58_story.html"">some</a> have <a href=""http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2014/12/what-selma-gets-wrong-113743.html?hp=m6#.VKCfjsCA"">accused</a> of <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/12/29/7458623/selma-backlash"">playing loose with historical facts.</a> But one of the strangest things about the film is how it deliberately misquotes the civil rights leader. The legal scholar Jonathan Band <a href=""http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2015/01/selma-martin-luther-king-can-you-copyright-a-dream-114187.html#.VLVu5GTF-Hp"">writes</a> that this was thanks to copyright law.</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p><em>Selma</em> director Ava DuVernay may well have taken more license than artistically necessary in the confrontational scenes between Martin Luther King Jr. and President Johnson. But inaccuracies in other significant parts of the film were forced upon DuVernay by copyright law. The film’s numerous scenes of King delivering powerful speeches regarding civil rights all had to be paraphrased, because the MLK estate has already licensed the film rights in those speeches to DreamWorks and Warner Bros., for an MLK biopic Steven Spielberg is slated to produce.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Copyright law has a doctrine called fair use that's supposed to deal with exactly this type of issue. If you want to use small portions of a copyrighted work to create a work of your own, copyright law often allows it without getting permission from the copyright owner. Indeed, I relied on fair use to quote the passage in the previous paragraph.</p> \n<p>So why didn't <em>Selma</em>'s director rely on fair use to justify quoting small portions of ""I Have a Dream""<em> </em>and other classic works by King? Most likely, the problem is that studios are <a href=""http://www.authorama.com/free-culture-11.html"">extremely conservative</a> about exercising fair use rights. And they have good reason to be wary.</p> \n<p><q class=""right"" aria-hidden=""true""><span>Fair use is supposed to operate as a safety valve for free expression</span></q></p> \n<p>If Paramount had distributed a version of <em>Selma</em> that relied on fair use to justify using some King clips, and a court later ruled these uses were not actually fair, it would have been a financial disaster. Paramount could have been on the hook for big damages and could even have been forced to cancel showings of the movie and destroy its inventory of <em>Selma</em> DVDs. <span>And the King estate is famously </span>litigious<span>, having sued both USA Today and CBS for quoting his ""I Have a Dream"" speech without permission.</span><span> So rather than take that kind of gamble, studios almost always insist that works be licensed, even if a plausible fair use argument exists.</span></p> \n<p>Fair use is supposed to operate as a safety valve for free expression. Without it, you can wind up giving the descendants of historical figures veto rights over how they are portrayed in print and film. Works that meet with the King family's approval can include excerpts from King's famous speeches, works that don't, can't.</p> \n<p>And the King family is far from the only example of an estate using copyright to police how a public figure is depicted. In one famous case, the grandson of James Joyce <a href=""http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/has-james-joyce-been-set-free"">used legal threats</a> to squelch biographies that cast his grandfather in a negative light.</p> \n<p>The ultimate solution, as Band notes, is for copyright terms to be shorter. Prior to 1976, the maximum length for copyright protection was 56 years. If that rule were still in effect, ""I have a Dream"" would fall into the public domain in 2019. After that, anyone could use the speech without worrying about copyright. But Congress has retroactively extended copyright protection in 1976 and again in 1998. As a result, Band says, King's works won't fall into the public domain until 2039.</p> \n<p>It would also be helpful if copyright penalties were less severe. The ability to gain an injunction against further publication of an infringing work, and ordering existing copies destroyed, is a particularly powerful weapon in the hands of copyright holders. Instead, publishers could be required to pay a share of their profits with copyright holders. That would make it easier for publishers to rely on fair use.</p>",Business & Finance

The price stabilized and then began rising again in 2012.</p> \n<p>That's because the value of Bitcoin-the-currency doesn't have much to do with the usefulness of Bitcoin-the-network. If you want to send someone $1,000 over the Bitcoin network, you can do that when one bitcoin is worth $100 or $10 as easily as you can when it's worth $1,000. You just buy and sell a correspondingly larger number of Bitcoins.</p> \n<p>Ultimately, Bitcoin's success or failure depends on <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/1/4/7491057/2015-will-be-a-make-or-break-year-for-bitcoin"">whether someone finds a ""killer app""</a> that will make the technology useful to a large number of people. Maybe that won't happen, and recent price declines may reflect growing pessimism by Bitcoin supporters. But this year's low prices don't prove Bitcoin is failing any more than last year's high prices proved the opposite.</p>",Business & Finance
Chipotle's nationwide carnitas shortages are actually great news,http://www.vox.com/2015/1/14/7546169/chipotle-pork-shortage,It's a stand for humane pork (and great marketing at the same time).,"<p>I went to my friendly neighborhood Chipotle on Sunday, and it had no carnitas. I thought it was just an idiosyncratic supply hiccup, but then I started hearing from friends and acquaintances about <em>widespread</em> lack of pork at Chipotles around America. Was sharia coming to America? Was Michel Houellebecq <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jan/09/soumission-michel-houellebecq-review-charlie-hebdo"">right about everything</a>?</p> \n<p>It turns out to actually be kind of a heartwarming, feel-good story. Chipotle is experiencing pork shortages because they found out that some of their suppliers <a href=""http://www.bigstory.ap.org/article/ff4fa613c05c4987a8399d702ee14c12/chipotle-no-pork-third-restaurants?utm_content=bufferb3558&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_campaign=buffer"">weren't in compliance with their standards for humane treatment of pigs</a>.</p> \n<p>A Chipotle spokesman told Candace Choi of the AP that they found out about the violation on Friday, and ""it's hard to say"" how long the pork shortage will last.</p> \n<p>With pork comprising only about 6 or 7 percent of Chipotle's sales and many burrito fans presumably willing to accept an alternate protein (my wife told me to buy her a chicken burrito instead, not to go elsewhere in search of pork), this is probably a stand the company can take without giving much up in the way of sales. And in some ways, the public relations coup could be priceless. Chipotle doesn't do a lot of conventional fast food advertising, but does put a heavy emphasis on unconventional ways to market themselves as a more ethical meat-eating alternative.</p> \n<p><iframe frameborder=""0"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/aMfSGt6rHos"" height=""315"" width=""560""></iframe></p> \n<h3>Further reading</h3> \n<ul> \n<li> <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/12/9/7357125/mcdonalds-sales-decline"">McDonalds is dying in America, and Chipotle is the killer</a>. </li> \n<li> <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/11/1/7137529/pig-decompose-sea-body-corpse-ocean-rot"">This is what happens when a pig decomposes under water</a>.</li> \n<li> <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/6/20/5825826/these-maps-show-where-all-the-worlds-cattle-chickens-and-pigs-live"">These maps show where all the world's cattle, pigs, and chickens are</a>.</li> \n<li> <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/4/30/5664782/insects"">You're already eating some insects, but you should be eating more</a>.</li> \n</ul>",Business & Finance

But the technology exists to build residential broadband networks that are a lot faster. In fact, a few American cities enjoy network speeds as high as 1,000 Mbps, 50 to 100 times faster than average.</p> \n<p>And some of these networks were built not by big telecom providers but by municipal governments or publicly-owned electrical utility companies. For example, the city of Chattanooga, TN, has a publicly utility that decided to get into the municipal broadband business in 2007. As a result, households there can now get 1 gigabit (1,000 Mbps) service for just $70 per month.</p> \n<p>Municipal broadband supporters view Cedar Falls, where Obama is visiting today, as another success story. There too, the local public utility company built a municipal broadband network that provides speeds of up to 1 gigabit per second. Gigabit service is expensive — $135 per month — but you can also get download speeds of 100 Mbps for $70 per month. That compares favorably to broadband service offered by conventional cable and telephone companies elsewhere in the country.</p> \n<p>While the networks in Chattanooga and Cedar Falls are impressive, it's important to note that private companies have had some notable successes as well. Google has built a gigabit fiber optic network in Kansas City, and is currently expanding to Austin, TX, and Provo, UT. An organization called Gig.U is working to arrange for private investors to finance gigabit networks in college towns.</p> \n<p>Traditional telecom companies are also working to make their networks faster. AT&amp;T is now offering gigabit speeds in a few cities, including Austin, and Comcast has said it will <a href=""http://gizmodo.com/comcast-says-itll-offer-gigabit-internet-this-year-1677763538"">start offering gigabit speeds</a> this year.</p> \n<h3>Municipal broadband is controversial — especially among Republicans</h3> \n<p>Municipal broadband services have their detractors. Critics argue that building municipal fiber is a big risk, and taxpayers are on the hook if the bet doesn't pay off. For example, they point to <a href=""http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/money/56288307-79/network-iprovo-provo-google.html.csp"">Provo, Utah</a>, which was forced to sell its public network to Google at a huge loss after the network failed to match lofty projections.</p> \n<p>Many municipal fiber opponents also have philosophical objections to the whole concept of governments building internet service. They believe it's unfair to use taxpayer dollars to compete with the private sector. And they think private companies will do a better job in the long run.</p> \n<p>Legislatures in 19 states have enacted laws restricting local governments from entering the broadband business:</p> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""2933414"" alt=""muni-restrictions.0.png"" src=""https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2933414/muni-restrictions.0.png""></p> \n<p> </p> \n<p class=""caption"">(<a href=""http://www.muninetworks.org/communitymap"" target=""_blank"">ILSR</a>)</p> \n<p> </p> \n<p>The Federal Communications Commission could preempt these state laws, giving municipalities nationwide the option to build municipal networks if they want to. FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler has <a href=""http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2014/02/fcc-thinks-it-can-overturn-state-laws-that-restrict-public-broadband/"">signaled</a> that he's open to the idea. This week President Obama threw his support behind the idea, writing a letter to the FCC encouraging the agency to clear away obstacles to government-owned fiber networks.</p> \n<p>But House Republicans don't agree. Last year, the Republican-controlled House <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/7/20/5913363/house-republicans-and-obamas-fcc-are-at-war-over-city-owned-internet"">passed language</a> banning the FCC from banning states from banning cities from building municipal networks. It never became law, thanks to opposition from Senate Democrats and President Obama. But it could become another flashpoint in the relationship between Republicans in Congress and the FCC — a relationship that's already been strained by disagreements over network neutrality regulations.</p> \n<p>This is one reason President Obama's support for municipal broadband is important. Now that he's on the record supporting the concept, he's more likely to veto legislation that tried to overrule the FCC on the issue. So Wheeler will have a relatively free hand to promote publicly-owned networks.</p>",Business & Finance
Refreshing the evergreen,http://www.vox.com/2015/1/15/7546877/evergreen-experiment,How and why we're trying to find a better way to use our past work.,"<p>One of things we're exploring at Vox.com is how to make better use of all the reporting, writing, and coding we've done before today.</p> \n<p>One of our experiments with this is the card stacks, where our writers can filter their daily reporting into a larger, deeper, and continuously updated topic resource. But during the perennially slow news period of mid-December, we decided to try something a little unusual.</p> \n<p>For one week, we asked our writers and editors to update and republish a number of articles — one each day — that were first posted more than two months ago. This is hardly a brand-new idea in digital journalism. But we did it a little differently. Rather than putting the old article back up again unchanged, or adding a little apologetic introductory text to explain why it was coming back and was possibly outdated in parts, we just told people to make the copy as good as it could be.</p> \n<p>So we changed the text to be up-to-date and accurate. We changed the headline if the writer felt the old headline didn't work very well. We added new information. We added new ideas. We rewrote sections that dragged. The result was that some pieces went up virtually identical to their original form. Others bordered on unrecognizable. Our articles have always had ""updated at"" rather than ""published at"" adjacent to our time stamp, so we simply changed the ""updated at"" time. Everything got tweeted from the <a href=""https://twitter.com/voxdotcom/"">@voxdotcom</a> twitter account and some of the stories went up on our <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/Vox"">Facebook</a> page.</p> \n<p>In a five-day period, we ran 88 of these stories, and collectively they brought in over 500,000 readers. That was great to see. The articles generated a lot of positive feedback, and some pieces that writers really put a lot of work into but that didn't attract much readership the first time around became hits.</p> \n<p>What was interesting — though not completely unexpected — was that no one even seemed to notice that we were flooding the site with previously published content. A lot of the articles were enthusiastically shared by people who had shared them the first time around, too. No one seemed gripped by a sense of deja vu, or, if they were, they didn't mention it.</p> \n<p>Which is great! On the modern web, content tends to arrive via miscellaneous streams rather than coherent chunks. So the meaning of strict chronology is breaking down regardless of what publishers do. If we can use our archives as a way to deliver more great pieces to today's audiences, then that's a huge win — for us and for them.</p> \n<p>Every single day, genuinely important, wonderfully interesting things happen in the world, and it's, of course, a core mission of journalists to tell people about them. But lots of important things aren't new at all, they're just longstanding patterns, structures, or systems. Even more commonly, some new development causes an issue to get attention or seem more relevant, but once you <em>do</em> start paying attention you see that you're just looking at one aspect of a longstanding issue — one you've written about extensively before.</p> \n<p>Journalism has long had the concept of the ""evergreen"" story — the story that was as true last May as it will be next Thursday — and slow news periods around the holidays have always been a traditional time to run them. But we think well-executed evergreen journalism is often the very best kind of journalism there is. We want to be doing it regularly, and we also want to be doing it better than traditional formats have allowed. Periodically refreshing stories so that timeless topics are covered in timely ways is one of our ideas about how to do that. This clearly isn't the last word in how to do digital evergreens, but we think the results were encouraging. So while we work on more and better ideas around evergreen journalism, we're going to make the December experiment a routine part of the site.</p> \n<p>We've asked our whole staff to do at least one refresh per week, and we're looking forward to seeing how it goes. Hopefully you'll find some great pieces you may have missed the first time around, or see some longstanding issues presented in a brand new light. And hopefully we'll get a bit closer to building and surfacing the persistent news resource we're working towards.</p>",Business & Finance
Why two prominent Republicans are now backing network neutrality,http://www.vox.com/2015/1/15/7548433/republicans-backing-network-neutrality,Two influential Republicans in Congress hope to strike a compromise that will head off unilateral action by the Federal Communications Commission.,"<p>Network neutrality is probably the most polarized technology issue in Washington DC. Throughout the Obama years, most Democrats have been for it, while most Republicans have been against it. Mitt Romney <a href=""http://www.theverge.com/2012/11/2/3583566/election-2012-obama-romney-johnson-stein-tech"">opposed network neutrality</a> in his 2012 campaign. Ted Cruz <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/11/10/7186317/obamacare-for-the-internet-ted-cruz"">called it</a> ""Obamacare for the internet"" back in November.</p> \n<p>Yet in an <a href=""http://blogs.reuters.com/great-debate/2015/01/14/congressional-proposal-offers-internet-rules-of-the-road/"">op-ed for Reuters</a> on Wednesday, Sen. John Thune (R-SD) and Rep. Fred Upton (R-MI) endorsed network neutrality and called for a bipartisan compromise to defend it. This could be a big deal because the authors chair key committees in their respective houses of Congress.</p> \n<p>This is the most conciliatory note senior Republicans in Congress have sounded on this issue in years. Thune has been <a href=""http://www.wicker.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2014/1/wicker-thune-statement-on-net-neutrality-decision"">calling</a> for Congress to overhaul telecommunications law for a while, but when he talked about the topic a year ago, he didn't specifically endorse network neutrality regulations. In April, Upton <a href=""http://energycommerce.house.gov/press-release/upton-and-walden-respond-administrations-latest-net-neutrality-proposal"">called</a> network neutrality regulations ""a solution in search of a problem.""</p> \n<p>Now the two men say they want to ""prohibit blocking and throttling"" and make it illegal for internet service providers to ""charge a premium to prioritize content delivery."" In other words, they're in favor of network neutrality.</p> \n<h3>A shifting political landscape</h3> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2934734/148468207.0.jpg"" alt=""148468207.0.jpg"" data-chorus-asset-id=""2934734""></p> \n<p> </p> \n<p class=""caption"">Sen. John Thune (R-SD) (Bill Clark/CQ Roll Call)</p> \n<p> </p> \n<p>Tom Wheeler, President Obama's choice to lead the Federal Communications Commission, may have forced Thune and Upton's hand. He's widely expected to push through a controversial plan to subject broadband networks to public utility regulation, a legal tactic known as ""reclassification."" Five years ago, this approach was so unpopular that opponents — including <a href=""http://www.cnet.com/news/liberal-group-worries-about-fcc-on-net-neutrality/"">dozens of Democrats</a> in Congress — described it as the ""nuclear option"" of broadband policy.</p> \n<p>But the political landscape shifted in 2014. Wheeler originally wanted to adopt only weak net neutrality rules that would leave room for big companies to pay for online ""fast lanes."" Grassroots activists pressured him to adopt stronger rules, and that was only possible with reclassification. Democrats in Congress increasingly supported this idea; when the cable industry tried to organize a letter opposing reclassification last May, <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/5/14/5718484/house-democrats-arent-supporting-big-cable-like-they-did-in-2010"">they could only find 20 Congressional Democrats</a> to sign on, down from 74 in 2010.</p> \n<p>Then in November, President Obama himself <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/11/10/7186179/obamas-big-net-neutrality-announcement-explained"">endorsed reclassification</a>. Officially this doesn't matter, since the FCC is an independent agency. But Obama's endorsement of the idea made it harder for Wheeler and the rest of the FCC's Democratic majority to ignore it.</p> \n<p>The FCC is now widely expected to reclassify. If it does so, Congress could lose a lot of influence. The FCC would have expanded power over broadband networks without further Congressional action. So Thune and Upton seem to be moderating their stance in hopes of striking a compromise — before the FCC pulls the trigger.</p> \n<h3>Why Thune and Upton face an uphill climb</h3> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2934786/461536324.0.jpg"" alt=""461536324.0.jpg"" data-chorus-asset-id=""2934786""></p> \n<p> </p> \n<p class=""caption"">Barack Obama promotes municipal broadband in Iowa on Wednesday. (Steve Pope/Getty Images)</p> \n<p> </p> \n<p>I've <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/11/14/7200799/net-neutrality-obama-congress"">argued before</a> that it would be best for Congress, not the FCC, to resolve the network neutrality debate. Reclassification would give the FCC the power it needs to enact network neutrality regulations, but it would also trigger other rules — <a href=""https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/07/forbearance-what-it-why-its-essential-net-neutrality-0"">including</a> ""rules about obscene phone calls, rate schedules, telephone operator services, and carrier reporting requirements"" — that were designed for old-fashioned telephone networks, not the modern digital world. Protecting network neutrality using reclassification would be pounding a round peg into a square hole. Only Congress has the power to reshape the hole.</p> \n<p>But Thune and Upton face two big obstacles: Republicans and Democrats.</p> \n<p>On the Republican side, the big problem is that the pair don't necessarily speak for everyone in their party. There's no sign that Cruz has rethought his view that network neutrality is ""Obamacare for the internet."" And after nearly a decade of conservative criticism of the concept, it will be a big challenge to get the Republican party to embrace serious network neutrality rules.</p> \n<p>At the same time, Democrats are increasingly unified in support of network neutrality, and they sense that they have the upper hand. Wheeler can reclassify without help from Congress, and Obama can veto any effort by Congress to stop Wheeler's rules from taking effect. So Democrats may not feel they have much to gain in signing onto a compromise that establishes weaker network neutrality rules than the ones Wheeler is planning.</p> \n<p>However, it would be a mistake for Democrats to dismiss Thune and Upton's overtures out of hand. Reclassification will likely allow Wheeler to establish workable network neutrality rules, but those rules would still have a lot of rough edges. Only Congress has the power to fully update the law and tie up the various loose ends reclassification would create.</p> \n<p>And there's a larger issue too: Obama and Wheeler can only impose network neutrality rules until January 2017, when they'll be replaced by a new president and FCC chairman. If the next president is a Republican, he or she could appoint a new FCC chairman who could undo all of Wheeler's work. Legislation can do two things: it can cement network neutrality rules into law, and it can build bipartisan support for the concept. That would make it more likely that network neutrality will be protected regardless of who wins the White House in 2016.</p>",Business & Finance
One reason more people aren't working: the pay is too low,http://www.vox.com/2015/1/15/7551475/job-openings-rate,"Employers are looking to add staff, but not actually hiring. Maybe offering a decent wage would do the job.","<p>Earlier this week, the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed that one of the odder trends in American business is continuing — job openings are growing much faster than hires.</p> \n<p>Here's a chart showing the rapid rise in job openings and the much more modest rise in hires:</p> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2935974/fredgraph-2.0.png"" alt=""fredgraph-2.0.png"" data-chorus-asset-id=""2935974""></p> \n<p>People sometimes see this as a sign of ""structural problems"" in the economy. But pair it with the continued weakness in wage growth and it looks to me more like stinginess. Business would like to add staff to their teams, but don't want to offer the higher pay that would be needed to attract candidates they want to hire.</p> \n<p>In crystal ball mode, I'd say this is a sign that wages are likely to rise soon. But to be honest, that's what I thought a few months ago. So instead I'll say this is a sign that wages <em>should</em> rise soon. If you want to fill those vacancies, offer better pay.

How the Swiss National Bank just made big trouble for Poland,http://www.vox.com/2015/1/15/7552089/swiss-currency-peg-franc,Friends don't let friends take out mortgages denominated in foreign currencies.,"<ol> \n<li>The Swiss franc soared almost 40 percent relative to the euro in early trading today, before settling at appreciation of ""only"" 14 percent.</li> \n<li>It's up relative to the US dollar by a similar amount. </li> \n<li>This came in the wake of a surprise announcement by the Swiss National Bank that it was <a href=""http://twitter.com/RobinWigg/status/555662003306766337/photo/1"">abandoning a years-long peg</a> that fixed the price of Swiss francs relative to euros. </li> \n<li>In the same announcement, the SNB said it would cut its key policy interest rate to <em>negative</em> 0.75 percent, pushing the country's negative rates experiment into some uncharted waters. </li> \n<li>Switzerland's stock market promptly fell almost 10 percent on the news.</li> \n</ol> \n<h3>Why is Switzerland doing this?</h3> \n<p>Back in the fall of 2011 with the value of the euro sagging and foreign investors pouring money into Swiss francs, the SNB was concerned about a weakening job market. The inflation rate had fallen to zero percent, so the bank was comfortable with the idea of aggressive monetary stimulus. So they did something much bolder than anything the US Federal Reserve or the European Central Bank has done. They formally set a target for a cheaper franc, and said they would print as many francs as it took — selling the francs for euros — to hit and maintain a fixed exchange rate between Switzerland and the <a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/eurozone-crisis/what-is-the-eurozone"">Eurozone</a>.</p> \n<p>Initially, a few investors tried to test the bank's will. But the SNB swiftly established its credibility and found it didn't need to do much of anything to maintain the peg.</p> \n<p>Recently, two things have changed.</p> \n<p>One is that the euro has fallen a lot relative to the dollar for reasons <a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/eurozone-crisis/greek-election"">related to the upcoming election in Greece</a>, meaning that the pegged franc is getting cheaper in dollar terms. The bank didn't necessarily want this outcome.</p> \n<p>The other is that foreigners <a href=""https://twitter.com/esoltas/status/555730990333984768"">started buying Swiss francs again</a>, meaning it was gut-check time for the SNB. Either commit to a new round of money-printing, or else decide that the peg is obsolete and go back to a floating exchange rate. They chose option #2.</p> \n<blockquote class=""twitter-tweet"" lang=""en""> \n<p>CHF Power. What. A.

The SNB believes that the Swiss economy can weather this storm, and that the use of interest rate tools — including negative rates — will be enough to stabilize things without a currency peg.</span></p> \n<h3>A disaster for Poland</h3> \n<p>Swiss exporters — especially <a href=""http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2015-01-15/swiss-exporters-face-tsunami-after-snb-unexpectedly-drops-cap.html"">watch-makers</a> concerned about new competition from Apple — are not happy about the change, which will make their products more expensive in foreign markets.</p> \n<p>But there is a whole other class of people who are going to lose out in the deal. Over the years, many people who are not Swiss have chosen to take advantage of Switzerland's low interest rates to take out home mortgages that are denominated in terms of Swiss francs. In the United States people (sensibly) almost never borrow money to buy a home in a foreign currency, so Americans are largely unfamiliar with this issue. But <a href=""http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/economics/11347894/Swiss-franc-shock-triggers-mortgage-panic-for-wealthy-homeowners.html"">wealthy English people do it</a>, as do Russian billionaires seeking London property.</p> \n<p>In Central Europe it's even more common. Fully 46 percent of Polish home loans are <a href=""http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2015-01-15/polish-banks-zloty-slump-as-swiss-franc-mortgages-get-expensive.html"">denominated in Swiss francs</a>.</p> \n<p>The problem here is twofold. Polish people earn incomes that are denominated in zlotys, and Polish real estate is priced in zlotys. So if you're a Polish person with a Swiss mortgage and the value of the franc soars, you simultaneously end up owing more on your house than the house is worth and owing more relative to your income than you are able to pay. This is why, in general, it is not wise to take out foreign mortgages. What you may gain in cheaper interest rates you lose in terms of exposing yourself to a wide new range of risks — risks that are managed by a foreign central bank that has no interest in your welfare.</p> \n<h3>The winners</h3> \n<p>The flipside is that if you're a Swiss person who neither works in nor owns a watch factory (or a hotel or other company that's strongly oriented toward foreign customers) a more expensive franc means more purchasing power.

The company says it's working on a new edition of the product, but isn't saying when it will be released.","<ol> \n<li>Google is <a href=""https://plus.google.com/+GoogleGlass/posts/9uiwXY42tvc"">halting sales</a> of Glass, the groundbreaking computer you wear on your face.</li> \n<li>Google says it's not dropping support for the product; instead, the company is working on transforming Glass from an experimental device into a mainstream consumer product.</li> \n<li>The Glass team will now report to Tony Fadell. Fadell was a key member of Apple's iPod team and then co-founded the home automation company Nest, which Google acquired last year for $3.2 billion.</li> \n</ol> \n<h3>Google Glass has been plagued with problems</h3> \n<p>Google Glass has been one of the search giant's highest-profile product announcements in recent years, with co-founder Sergey Brin taking an active role in the project. Glass was formally <a href=""http://www.theverge.com/2012/6/27/3121288/google-glass-explorer-edition-announcement"">announced in 2012</a>, and the device was <a href=""http://www.theverge.com/2013/2/22/4013406/i-used-google-glass-its-the-future-with-monthly-updates"">released to developers</a> in 2013.</p> \n<p>And then ... not much happened. Developers have experimented with the device, but haven't come up with any breakthrough applications for it. Software updates from Google have slowed. The project's founder was <a href=""http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2014/07/founder-of-google-glass-leaves-for-amazon/"">poached by Amazon</a> in July. As Ars Technica <a href=""http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2014/12/google-glass-isnt-dead-intel-powered-update-reportedly-due-in-2015/"">put it</a> in December, ""The official forums, once a bustling hive of optimism, now mostly discuss declining usage or low morale among remaining Glass users.""</p> \n<p>The mainstream release of the product, originally slated for 2014, never happened.</p> \n<p>One big reason Glass hasn't caught on is the cost. At a price of $1,500, Glass needs some pretty compelling applications to get people to buy one. And with few people buying them, there was little reason for developers to create Glass software.</p> \n<p>And Glass has also attracted a lot of public<strong> </strong>hostility. Many people don't like the idea of someone walking around with a camera attached to their face, potentially taking a picture at any time. Many people also believe that Glass users look ridiculous.</p> \n<p>Most importantly, Google has struggled to make the case that Glass is actually useful. The efficiency gains from having your computer screen attached to your glasses, instead of in your pocket, don't seem very big. And while Google has done impressive work making Glass user-friendly, the user interface still strikes many people as clumsy compared with a touchscreen phone.</p> \n<h3>Will Glass shift to the workplace?</h3> \n<p>Despite Glass's poor reception, Google says it's not giving up. The company is hard at work building the next iteration of the device.</p> \n<p>One intriguing possibility is that Google may shift its focus from the mainstream consumer market to more specialized applications in the workplace. Six weeks ago, the Wall Street Journal <a href=""http://www.wsj.com/articles/google-glass-deal-thrusts-intel-deeper-into-wearable-devices-1417395598"">reported</a> that Google had inked a deal with Intel to supply the chips needed to power the next iteration of Google Glass.</p> \n<p>""Google is working with software developers including Augmedix Inc. and APX Labs LLC to encourage use of Glass in industries such as health care, construction and manufacturing where employees work with their hands but need information,"" the Journal reported.</p> \n<p>Marketing Glass at work could address several of the product's challenges simultaneously. A device that's worn only at work would raise fewer privacy concerns than one that's routinely worn at social functions. And while consumers might balk at paying $1,500 for a gadget, employers routinely spend much more than that on equipment to make their workers more productive.</p> \n<p>Still, in November Google was still insisting that it expected Glass to be a mainstream consumer device. To make that happen, they'll have to create a device impressive enough to overcome growing public skepticism about the technology.</p> \n<p><b>Disclosure:</b> My <a href=""https://twitter.com/startupandrew"" target=""_blank"">brother</a> is an <a href=""https://www.firebase.com/blog/2014-10-21-firebase-joins-google.html"" target=""_blank"">executive</a> at Google.</p>",Business & Finance
"The myth of Amazon's ebook monopoly, in two screenshots",http://www.vox.com/2015/1/16/7555365/apple-google-ebook-search,The retail giant is much more vulnerable than people realize.,"<p>Thursday night in New York I participated in a <a href=""http://intelligencesquaredus.org/debates/upcoming-debates/item/1250-amazon-is-the-readers-friend&amp;tab=4"" target=""_blank"">debate with Frank Foer and Scott Turow</a> over Amazon's role in the evolving book marketplace (see an earlier round of <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/10/22/7016827/amazon-hachette-monopoly"" target=""_blank"">me versus Foer</a>). My side lost the debate largely, I think, because we ended up spending an awful lot of time discussing hypothetical scenarios in which Amazon drives brick-and-mortar retailers entirely out of business even while maintaining a dominant share in the ebook market.</p> \n<p>This simply strikes me as an exceptionally unlikely scenario. As <a href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/look-at-how-apple-and-google-can-cut-off-amazon-2015-1"" target=""_blank"">Jay Yarow recently wrote</a>, Amazon actually has a huge problem in the ebook market — people find books through platforms that Apple and Google control.</p> \n<p>Look what giant sidebar pops up if I look for Foer's book <a style=""font-size: 17px; line-height: 28.4624996185303px; background-color: #ffffff;"" href=""http://www.amazon.com/How-Soccer-Explains-World-Globalization/dp/0061978051"" target=""_blank"">How Soccer Explains The World</a> in the search bar of my Chrome browser</p> \n<p><img style=""font-size: 1.15em; line-height: 1.65;"" data-chorus-asset-id=""2938264"" alt=""Screen_Shot_2015-01-15_at_11.43.42_PM.0.png"" src=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2938264/Screen_Shot_2015-01-15_at_11.43.42_PM.0.png""></p> \n<p>Look what happens if I look for in the search bar of my Safari browser:</p> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""2938268"" alt=""Screen_Shot_2015-01-15_at_11.44.10_PM.0.png"" src=""https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2938268/Screen_Shot_2015-01-15_at_11.44.10_PM.0.png""></p> \n<p>That's Apple delivering a very heavy push to buy the book in their iBook store. Google is using a lighter — but still meaningful — push to buy the book in the Google Play store. And Amazon is inherently vulnerable to this tactic.</p> \n<p>I assume that's why Jeff Bezos was so eager to the develop a Fire Phone product. Amazon's original ebook dominance was built on a hardware device, the Kindle, that Amazon controls. But as mobile phones have gotten bigger and tablets have gotten cheaper, Android and iOS products are increasingly viable as reading devices. Kindle books work great on those platforms — I love the Kindle app on my iPad —  but Amazon has no control over the platform and is at constant risk of getting squeezed out. But the <a href=""http://www.fastcompany.com/3040383/following-fire-phone-flop-big-changes-at-amazons-lab126"" target=""_blank"">Fire phone was a huge flop</a>.

The next frontier of hacking: your car,http://www.vox.com/2015/1/18/7629603/car-hacking-dangers,"As cars become more computerized, car companies need to worry more about hackers attacking them.","<p>Hacking is about to get more dangerous.</p> \n<p>In recent years, a string of high-profile attacks on companies like <a href=""http://arstechnica.com/security/2014/02/epic-target-hack-reportedly-began-with-malware-based-phishing-e-mail/"">Target</a> and <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/12/14/7387945/sony-hack-explained"">Sony Pictures</a> has highlighted the importance of computer security. But almost all of the recent attacks have had one upside: they didn't kill anyone. Indeed, most hacks haven't done any physical damage at all.</p> \n<p>But that could soon change. The recent Consumer Electronic Show was full of car companies promoting plans to <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/1/7/7508085/car-smartphone-carplay-ces"">build ever more sophisticated computers into automobiles</a>. Cars are going to have sophisticated navigation and entertainment systems, they'll integrate better with our smartphones, and they'll have better and better self-driving capabilities.</p> \n<p>That will make our cars more convenient, efficient, and safer. But it's also going to make it easier for tech-savvy troublemakers to cause serious harm — or even car crashes.</p> \n<h3>Cars are increasingly becoming computer networks on wheels</h3> \n<p>Modern-day automobiles already contain dozens of computer systems that handle a wide variety of functions, from playing music to deciding when to deploy the airbags. These computers often need to communicate with each other — for example, data from the speedometer and braking systems can help decide whether to lock the seat belts in anticipation of a crash — so they're frequently linked together on shared networks.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""right""><span>cars are becoming more connected — and therefore more vulnerable — to the outside world</span></q></p> \n<p>Until recently, this didn't create much of a hacking risk because attackers could only access the car's internal network if they had physical access to the car. (And of course, someone with physical access can already do damage by slashing tires or cutting brake lines.)</p> \n<p>But cars are becoming more connected — and therefore more vulnerable — to the outside world. In 2011, researchers at the University of California at San Diego and the University of Washington conducted an <a href=""http://www.autosec.org/pubs/cars-usenixsec2011.pdf"">in-depth study</a> of a particular late-model vehicle (they didn't say which one). They found it was alarmingly vulnerable to external attack.</p> \n<p>In one attack, they created a malicious music file that, if played on the car's stereo, would let the hackers gain control of the car's computer systems. In another, they demonstrated that they could hack into the diagnostic equipment used by auto mechanics using its wifi connection, and from there install malicious software onto vehicles being serviced.</p> \n<h3>Hacking a car could do a lot of damage</h3> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""3049802"" alt=""452118155.0.jpg"" src=""https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3049802/452118155.0.jpg""></p> \n<p> </p> \n<p class=""caption"">Researchers found that after plugging into the internal network of a Ford Escape, they could electronically disable its brakes. (Scott Olson/Getty Images)</p> \n<p> </p> \n<p>Perhaps the most alarming vulnerability was in the car's emergency-assistance system, which uses a cellular network to communicate with emergency response personnel in the event of a crash. The UCSD and UW researchers found that hackers could call the phone number associated with this system's wireless connection and play a series of tones to activate the car's modem and then hack into the vehicle.</p> \n<p>Once hackers gain control over a car using any of these methods, they can do a lot of damage. They can activate the vehicle's internal microphone and eavesdrop on conversations that take place inside. They can unlock the doors and disable the vehicle's security mechanisms, making car theft easy.</p> \n<p>Worst of all, attackers could cause the car to crash. A couple of years ago, for example, security researchers Charlie Miller and Chris Valesek demonstrated the ability to use the internal network of a Ford Escape to <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/andygreenberg/2013/07/24/hackers-reveal-nasty-new-car-attacks-with-me-behind-the-wheel-video/"">disable the brakes</a>. They were also able to violently jerk the steering wheel of a Toyota Prius. If an attacker did these things while someone was driving down the highway, it could get people killed.</p> \n<h3>It's still very hard to hack today's cars</h3> \n<p>So why haven't we seen hackers send cars careening off the road yet? A big reason is that, for the time being, cars are still very different from computers or smartphones — and attacks need to be highly focused in order to succeed. That won't always be the case.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""right""><span>For the time being, attacks need to be highly focused in order to succeed</span></q></p> \n<p>Because modern PCs and smartphones run a handful of standard operating systems — Windows, Android, iOS — a single piece of malware can compromise millions of devices. Up until now, cars have been different. The various computers inside a car each run custom software that may not be the same from model to model and from year to year. So to attack a particular vehicle, you have to know a lot about the specific software it's running and what vulnerabilities it has. Thus far, only a handful of academic researchers have had the talent and resources necessary to develop working car hacks.</p> \n<p>What's more, hacking PCs and smartphones is relatively easy because they're constantly connected to the internet. Hackers can create malware that spreads from one online machine to the next or scan random internet addresses looking for vulnerable computers. This kind of attack wouldn't work for today's cars. To hack their car via the cellular network, those UCSD and UW researchers had to know the specific phone number to call. It would be hopelessly inefficient for a hacker to call phone numbers at random until she reached a vulnerable vehicle.</p> \n<h3>But cars will be far more hackable in the future</h3> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""3049812"" alt=""gm-slacker.0.jpg"" src=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3049812/gm-slacker.0.jpg""></p> \n<p> </p> \n<p class=""caption"">Chevy's next-generation touchscreen interface. (The Verge)</p> \n<p> </p> \n<p>But that's all likely to change — and the next generation of cars will be even more vulnerable. Chevy, for example, is <a href=""http://www.theverge.com/2014/1/5/5276536/cars-are-the-new-smartphones-chevrolet-adding-lte-and-app-store-to-2015-models"">adding LTE</a> wireless capabilities and an app store to its vehicles. BMW is adding wifi capabilities to its cars, which will <a href=""http://www.cnet.com/pictures/bmw-connecteddrive-offers-rolling-wi-fi-in-car-browser-street-view/"">feature a dashboard web browser</a>. In short, cars are going to start looking more like conventional computers, which means they'll become more vulnerable to conventional attacks.</p> \n<p>In the next year or two, most car manufacturers are going to support Android Audio and Apple's Carplay — standards that allow smartphones to control a car's dashboard touchscreen display. These interfaces could provide another potential route for hacking: first compromise vitims' phones (for example, by <a href=""http://www.pcworld.com/article/2099421/report-malwareinfected-android-apps-spike-in-the-google-play-store.html"">uploading malicious software to Google's app store</a>), then have the phones compromise their cars.</p> \n<p>These problems will get even worse as cars gain more sophisticated self-driving capabilities. Cars are going to need ways to download software upgrades, get updated maps, and look up information and road closures. Allowing cars to download all of that data without putting them at risk from hackers is going to be a challenging security problem.</p> \n<h3>We need a culture change at auto companies</h3> \n<p>None of these problems are insurmountable. Software companies have been grappling with internet security threats for nearly two decades, and they've gotten pretty good at it.</p> \n<p>But there are a couple of big obstacles. One is getting car companies to take security seriously. Safety has long been a major concern for the auto industry, but they've traditionally focused on problems caused by faulty components or driver error, not cyberattacks.</p> \n<p>""Traditionally automobiles have not been network-connected and thus manufacturers have not had to anticipate the actions of an external adversary,"" the UCSD and UW security researchers wrote in their 2011 paper.</p> \n<p>A comprehensive security audit of a car's software needs to become a standard part of a vehicle's safety testing process. Just as automakers conduct crash tests and see how crash dummies fare, so car companies should hire <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_team"">""red teams""</a> to attempt to hack into cars in order to discover vulnerabilities.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""right""><span>A comprehensive security audit of a car's software needs to become standard</span></q></p> \n<p>This will also require cultural and organizational changes inside of car companies. An important part of any computer security audit is to examine software's source code looking for programming mistakes that could cause vulnerabilities. But in many cases, car companies don't even have the source code for all of the computing devices in their vehicles. Their suppliers consider this proprietary information and guard it closely.</p> \n<p>That will have to change. Many of the vulnerabilities the UCSD and UW researchers discovered occurred because the creators of different computing systems inside the car made different security assumptions about how the software would fit together. Catching these kinds of problems will require a comprehensive view into the vehicle that only the automaker itself can have. So car companies will need to push their suppliers to share their source code and cooperate with security audits.</p> \n<h3>The industry is responding — slowly</h3> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""3049826"" alt=""169375002.0.jpg"" src=""https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3049826/169375002.0.jpg""></p> \n<p> </p> \n<p class=""caption"">Researchers found that once they had plugged into the internal network of a Toyota Prius, they could cause the steering wheel to jerk back and forth violently while the vehicle was in motion. (Alexander Tamargo/Getty Images for Toyota)</p> \n<p> </p> \n<p>""Manufacturers have definitely taken the issue seriously, as well as the Society for Automotive Engineers, and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration,"" says Stephen Checkoway. He was the lead author of that 2011 car-hacking study while he was a grad student at UCSD. He's now a computer science professor at Johns Hopkins University. ""They've all reacted in what I can only characterize as the most positive way possible.""</p> \n<p>Both the SAE and NHTSA have begun producing new standards and guidelines for guarding cars against online security threats. And some car companies have begun to make the issue a priority as well. General Motors, for example, recently hired its first Chief Product Cybersecurity Officer.</p> \n<p>A big problem, according car security researcher Chris Valasek, is a lack of transparency. Software companies like Microsoft and Twitter are highly engaged with the computer security community. That's not as true in the automotive industry. ""Unless you purchase a car and tear it down, you don't really know what's there to protect you,"" Valasek says. Unfortunately, ""it's really expensive to get started. Cars and their parts and tools are costly."" So few researchers have the necessary resources.</p> \n<p>In the long run, it will be in the interest of car companies to encourage security experts to tear apart their vehicles and find the vulnerabilities. Because if the good guys don't do it, the bad guys will. And that will be much worse for the car companies — in the worst case, it could even cost some customers their lives.</p> \n<p><b>Correction:</b> This article originally misidentified the University of California, San Diego, as the University of California, Santa Barbara.</p>",Business & Finance

This sort of network could bring internet access to unconnected areas that don't have telecommunications lines — particularly in the developing world.</p> \n<p>Google's ambitions in this area have been clear for a while now. In 2013, it launched an experimental network called <a href=""http://www.google.com/loon/how/"">Project Loon</a>, made up of large balloons that floated above New Zealand, allowing users on the ground to connect to a wireless internet network. But there was a lot of skepticism around the balloon plan.</p> \n<p>Google has also <a href=""http://www.wired.com/2015/01/google-spacex-investment/"">been developing</a> a satellite-based system, though that too has faced hurdles. In September, the leader of Google's satellite project, Greg Wyler, left the company to form his own satellite-internet company called OneWeb.</p> \n<p>Now, it seems that Google may be looking to partner with SpaceX — a rocket manufacturing and launching company — to build a new satellite network. (Before founding OneWeb, Wyler also <a href=""https://www.theinformation.com/Google-Nears-Major-Investment-in-SpaceX-to-Bolster-Satellites"">reportedly negotiated</a> with SpaceX  — but a deal never materialized.)</p> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2904984/CRS-4_Launch__1_.0.jpeg"" alt=""spacex launch"" data-chorus-asset-id=""2904984""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">(<a href=""http://www.spacex.com/media-gallery/detail/118081/4036"">SpaceX</a>)</p> \n<p>Musk has described SpaceX's planned network of communications satellites in pretty grandiose terms: ""Our focus is on creating a global communications system that would be larger than anything that has been talked about to date,"" <a href=""http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2015-01-17/elon-musk-and-spacex-plan-a-space-internet#p1"">he told Bloomberg Businessweek</a>.</p> \n<p>He said he'd do this with hundreds of micro-satellites in low Earth orbit (much closer to us than the geosynchronous satellites typically used for communication, which orbit at about 22,000 miles above sea level, allowing them to remain above one spot on Earth over time). Using lasers to send signals from satellite to satellite, Musk claimed, would allow data to be transmitted over vast distances much faster than it is currently, through ground-based networks. He even alluded to the possibility that the network could someday be used to create a communications network with Mars.</p> \n<p>Of course, there are plenty of reasons to be skeptical of the plan. One obvious one, as the <a href=""http://www.wsj.com/articles/google-nears-1-billion-investment-in-spacex-1421706642"">Wall Street Journal points out</a>, is that the use of lasers to send data from satellites to the ground isn't reliable all the time, as they can be hindered by bad weather. And the backup option — using radio waves — might be tricky, as neither SpaceX nor Google own the rights to the spectrum they'd likely need to beam signals down from these satellites to potential users. Google, in fact, lost some spectrum rights to Wyler when he left the company in September.</p> \n<p>Musk said the satellite network would cost $10 billion in total, and take at least five years to build. He has previously avoided giving up any control of SpaceX whenever possible, but in taking this deal, just gave up nearly ten percent of the company — so it may be a sign that he's pretty serious about trying to build it.</p> \n<hr> \n<p><b>Correction</b>: This post originally said that using lasers to send data between satellites (rather than from satellites to the ground) wasn't always reliable.</p>",Business & Finance
"Now that liberals are winning on net neutrality, Republicans want a compromise",http://www.vox.com/2015/1/21/7867869/net-neutrality-republican-compromise,Republicans hope to head off unilateral FCC action on network neutrality with a legislative compromise. But liberals don't seem very interested.,"<p>With the Federal Communications Commission on the brink of establishing strong network neutrality rules, Republicans in Congress are scrambling to preempt the agency with legislation of their own. Supporters of the bill say it gives net neutrality advocates exactly what they've asked for, making action by the FCC unnecessary. But longtime net neutrality boosters aren't buying it.</p> \n<p>The Republican bill, sponsored by Sen. John Thune (R-SD) and Rep. Fred Upton (R-MI), is <a href=""http://www.stanfordlawreview.org/online/new-republican-bill-is-network-neutrality-in-name-only"">""network neutrality in name only,""</a> according to the legal scholar and net-neutrality supporter Barbara van Schewick. The liberal activist group Demand Progress calls it a ""cynical ploy,"" adding in an email that ""in a town used to policy flip flops, this is a pirouette of Olympic caliber.""</p> \n<p>Today both houses of the new Republican Congress are holding hearings meant to lay the groundwork for a bipartisan network neutrality deal. But network neutrality supporters, sensing that they have the upper hand, see little reason to compromise.</p> \n<h3>Republicans used to oppose network neutrality regulations</h3> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3326758/460307550.0.jpg"" alt=""460307550.0.jpg"" data-chorus-asset-id=""3326758""></p> \n<p> </p> \n<p class=""caption"">Network neutrality protestors disrupt a December meeting of the Federal Communications Commission. (BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI/AFP/Getty Images)</p> \n<p> </p> \n<p>Network neutrality is the idea that internet service providers should offer<b> </b>a level playing field between different applications and types of online content. Network neutrality advocates worry that if ISPs start giving higher priority to content from big companies that pay them extra, startups and other small content providers could get squeezed out.</p> \n<p>But critics, including many Republicans, have long argued that market forces can safeguard online innovation without government involvement. Last May, Upton was <a href=""http://energycommerce.house.gov/press-release/upton-and-walden-respond-fcc-vote-proposed-net-neutrality-rules"">describing network neutrality rules</a> as a ""solution in search of a problem.""</p> \n<p>Network neutrality supporters believe that in order to fully protect network neutrality, the FCC needs to declare broadband providers to be common carriers, an option known as reclassification. But until last year, opponents had managed to <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/5/15/5718152/heres-the-case-against-re-classifying-broadband"">brand this option as politically toxic</a> — the ""nuclear option"" of internet regulation.</p> \n<p>A massive internet protest changed that. When Tom Wheeler, President Obama's choice to head the Federal Communications Commission, <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/5/15/5720360/the-fcc-just-voted-on-net-neutrality-rules-heres-what-you-need-to-know"">unveiled a proposal that didn't involved reclassification</a> in May, internet activists revolted. They were aided by a <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/6/2/5773686/john-oliver-delivers-the-clearest-most-hilarious-explanation-of-net"">John Oliver segment</a> that racked up 7 million views on YouTube. In November, President Obama <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/11/10/7186179/obamas-big-net-neutrality-announcement-explained"">threw his weight</a> behind reclassification. The pressure worked; in recent weeks, Wheeler has signaled he intends to adopt the stronger network neutrality rules that activists have been demanding.</p> \n<p>That has alarmed large broadband providers and their allies in Congress, because it potentially opens the door to regulations that go far beyond network neutrality. So after years of denying that any legislation was needed, Republicans are suddenly taking a conciliatory stance. Earlier this month, Thune and Upton <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/1/15/7548433/republicans-backing-network-neutrality"">announced their intention</a> to introduce network neutrality regulations.</p> \n<h3>The new Republican proposal is a tactical retreat</h3> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3326764/461491474.0.jpg"" alt=""461491474.0.jpg"" data-chorus-asset-id=""3326764""></p> \n<p> </p> \n<p class=""caption"">Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) and Sen. John Thune (R-SD). (Win McNamee/Getty Images)</p> \n<p> </p> \n<p>Ryan Radia, a network neutrality skeptic at the libertarian Competitive Enterprise Institute, readily concedes that the GOP's changing stance is ""kind of a flip-flop,"" but he says the shift is justified.</p> \n<p>The problem, from Radia's perspective, is that Wheeler's reclassification proposal could open the door to a lot more intrusive regulation of the internet in the future. Critics like to point out that some of the laws governing common carriers, known to telecom insiders as ""Title II,"" date back to the 1930s. In theory, regulating the internet under Title II could lead to the FCC dictating the prices broadband providers charge consumers and micromanaging how internet providers connect with each other.</p> \n<p>Wheeler has made it clear that his rules will avoid applying the most burdensome regulations. But critics say that once the FCC has seized broader authority, nothing would stop a future FCC chairman from regulating the internet more aggressively. Republicans, Radia says, ""think a world of net neutrality but no Title II is less harmful"" than Wheeler's proposal to dramatically expand the FCC's authority over the internet.</p> \n<p>""Republicans are calling the far left's bluff,"" Radia says. ""You see Republicans coming forward with more or less what Democrats want. Title II has always been justified on the grounds that it's the legal source for net neutrality authority. It's difficult to see how that doesn't satisfy most if not all of what net neutrality advocates want.""</p> \n<h3>Liberals aren't impressed by the Republican bill</h3> \n<p>Of course, most network neutrality advocates see things differently. John Bergmayer, a network neutrality supporter at Public<b> </b>Knowledge<b>, </b>acknowledges that Thune and Upton's legislation addresses some of the most frequently mentioned concerns of network neutrality advocates — including concerns about ISPs blocking or throttling content. But he says that other problems might crop up in the future, and the Republican bill would strip the FCC of authority to deal with them.</p> \n<p>For example, Bergmayer worries that ISPs might harm competition by charging consumers different rates for different types of content — for example, charging customers extra fees when they download content from Netflix rather than Hulu. Or they might discriminate in interconnection deals, refusing to perform the upgrades necessary to deliver high-bandwidth content to their customers unless content providers paid extra. (Comcast and Verizon were accused of <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/5/2/5665890/beyond-net-neutrality-the-new-battle-for-the-future-of-the-internet"">doing just that</a> last year.)</p> \n<p>The Republican bill appears to strip the FCC of authority to regulate these practices. And for Bergmayer — and many network neutrality supporters — that makes the legislation unacceptable.</p> \n<p><q class=""right"" aria-hidden=""true""><span>Democrats have little reason to compromise</span></q></p> \n<p>Also, Bergmayer said, Thune and Upton's legislation relies on a cumbersome case-by-case process for policing network neutrality violations. Right now, the FCC can establish general regulations defining what constitutes illegal discrimination. But under the Republican alternative, an aggrieved party would have to bring a complaint before the FCC, a process that could take years and might not provide protections to others harmed by the same ISP conduct.</p> \n<p>Van Schewick and her Stanford University co-author Morgan Weiland offer an <a href=""http://www.stanfordlawreview.org/online/new-republican-bill-is-network-neutrality-in-name-only"">even more scathing assessment</a> of the Republican proposal, detailing seven different ways the bill falls short of full protection for an open internet. They note that the law includes several vague terms that could create loopholes for undermining network neutrality and gives the FCC limited authority to close these loopholes.</p> \n<p>And the reality is that Democrats have little reason to compromise. Put simply, Wheeler doesn't need Congress's help to establish strong network neutrality rules. And that means Republicans have little leverage.</p> \n<p>""It's definitely useful that Republicans are willing to go on the record with support for some version of network neutrality,"" Bergmayer says. But he argues that Republicans are going to need to offer a lot more in order to win bipartisan support.</p>",Business & Finance
5 questions you were too embarrassed to ask about Davos,http://www.vox.com/2015/1/22/7868619/5-questions-you-were-too-embarrassed-to-ask-about-davos,The World Economic Forum's annual gathering of the well-heeled is on. But what exactly happens there?,"<p>It's Davos time again. Pretty much anyone who might be considered a mover or a shaker in the business world is in the Swiss Alps right now as you're reading this, networking and skiing and partying to the tune of <a href=""http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2015/01/19/davos-world-economic-forum-preview/21743969/"">$40,000</a>, by one estimate.</p> \n<p>It gets a hefty amount of media attention for a summit. CNBC has an <a href=""http://www.cnbc.com/id/102351009#."">entire blog</a> devoted to it and is broadcasting from Switzerland. Huffington Post likewise has a <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/01/21/world-economic-forum-2015_n_6505268.html"">liveblog</a>, complete with a live video feed. The New York Times' <a href=""http://dealbook.nytimes.com/"">Dealbook</a> section has sent a small delegation. Why do people pay attention? And does anything ever actually get done?</p> \n<p>Read our explainer to understand a bit about why what could be just another boring conference makes headlines every year.</p> \n<h3>1) What exactly is going on in Davos this week?</h3> \n<p>When you hear people talk about Davos, it's shorthand for the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum, essentially a massive conference of elites put on by an eponymous non-profit every year. This year is the 45th annual gathering, which always takes place in Davos, a small city in the Swiss Alps. Only around 11,000 people live there, but the city swells each year to accommodate thousands of guests — this year, well over 2,500 attendees are expected.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""right"">every year, there's a grand but vague organizing theme. This year, it's ""the new global context""</q></p> \n<p>The forum is billed as a chance for elites to gather, exchange ideas, and find ways to tackle pressing global problems. Every year, there's a grand but vague organizing theme. This year, they settled on <a href=""https://agenda.weforum.org/2014/10/theme-davos-2015/"">""The New Global Context""</a> as a theme, referring to ""the period of profound political, economic, social and technological change that the world has entered, which has the potential to end the era of economic integration and international partnership that began in 1989.""</p> \n<p>That broad theme allows there to be sessions on just about any hot topic — this year, sessions on income inequality, genomics, artificial intelligence, and the Israel-Palestine conflict are all on the program.</p> \n<p>The forum has been around since 1971, when it was founded by Klaus Schwab, chairman of the WEF and a professor at the University of Geneva, according to Nick Paumgarten's excellent <a href=""http://archives.newyorker.com/?iid=59924&amp;crd=0&amp;searchKey=davos#folio=046"">2012 New Yorker article</a> on the forum (subscription required). Back then, it was called the European Management Forum. The name was changed to the World Economic Forum in 1987, to reflect its global nature. Of course, not all regions or groups are represented equally (more on that later).</p> \n<h3>2) Who goes?</h3> \n<p>It's just about the biggest gathering of elites as you're going to find. Business leaders by far make up the largest group. <a href=""http://qz.com/329787/davos-is-still-mostly-a-mens-club/"" target=""_blank"">Quartz</a> counts 2,872 <a href=""http://qz.com/329512/search-and-sort-the-list-of-everyone-attending-davos-this-week/"" target=""_blank"">attendees</a>, and the WEF says around 1,500 are businesspeople, including high-profile executives like Yahoo's Marissa Mayer and Facebook's Sheryl Sandberg. Heads of state and government also attend — this year's guest list includes prime ministers and presidents from around the world — as well as academics and media personalities. And of course, there's always a handful of celebrities. Davos might be the only place this year where you can bump into George Soros, Maria Bartiromo, Eric Schmidt, and <a href=""http://www.cnbc.com/id/102349089"" target=""_blank"">Pharrell</a> at the same party. Or where will.i.am and Sir Richard Branson would party together with the Wall Street Journal.</p> \n<blockquote class=""twitter-tweet"" lang=""en""> \n<p>Rocking out at wall street journal party at davos</p> \n— will.i.am (@iamwill) <a href=""https://twitter.com/iamwill/status/557983481440256000"">January 21, 2015</a>\n</blockquote> \n<p> \n<script src=""//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"" charset=""utf-8""></script> \n</p> \n<blockquote class=""twitter-tweet"" lang=""en""> \n<p>Me and sir <a href=""https://twitter.com/richardbranson"">@richardbranson</a> steady chillin in <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/davos?src=hash"">#davos</a> <a href=""http://t.co/MnceHkWGV4"">http://t.co/MnceHkWGV4</a></p> \n— will.i.am (@iamwill) <a href=""https://twitter.com/iamwill/status/557847210352984064"">January 21, 2015</a>\n</blockquote> \n<p> \n<script src=""//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"" charset=""utf-8""></script> \n</p> \n<p>And where the rich and powerful meet, there are often protesters close behind. In 2013, women from Ukrainian feminist group Femen <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/01/28/femen-topless-protest-davos-switzerland-world-economic-forum_n_2567542.html"">staged a topless protest</a>, saying the leaders at Davos were ""imitating concern about the fates of women."" In 2014, Ukraine's protests against President Viktor Yanukovych came to Davos <a href=""http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2014/01/24/davos-ukraine-protesters-world-economic-forum/4820265/"">as well</a>.</p> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3327562/464181017.0.jpg"" alt=""Matt Damon Davos"" data-chorus-asset-id=""3327562""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Matt Damon was one of last year's celebrity guests. (Getty Images)</p> \n<h3>3) What actually happens there?</h3> \n<p>Officially, the usual stuff of conferences — speeches, panel sessions, networking.</p> \n<p>But a few things make Davos special. First of all, the <a href=""http://www3.weforum.org/docs/AM15/WEF_AM15_Programme_A3526EC2F4.pdf"">program</a> includes the kind of special events you'd expect if you were paying tens of thousands of dollars to attend — this year, a concert by tenor Andrea Bocelli helped kick things off, as well as a <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2015/01/21/amid-the-chattering-of-the-global-elite-a-silent-interlude"">group meditation session</a> led by Jon Kabat-Zinn, one of the world's leading mindfulness experts.</p> \n<p>And even then, as Paumgarten wrote, many Davos participants don't attend a single official Davos session. And that's because what truly makes Davos notable is of course its guest list. Business leaders, government officials, and celebrities all gather to hear the talks, but they really gather to mingle. It's often described as a small world of its own, in which the rich and powerful casually bump into each other as they pass in hallways and bars.</p> \n<p>And with those guests comes heavy media coverage. Outlets like CNBC and Huffington Post breathlessly cover the conference every year as reporters spend a few days in close proximity to potential high-profile sources.</p> \n<p>Davos is all about status and access, and the parties make that clear, as Business Insider's <a href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/the-truth-about-davos-what-happens-when-you-dont-get-invited-to-any-parties-2011-1"">Henry Blodget</a> wrote in 2011. Not attending the parties that take place at the end of a long day of session-attending, he wrote, makes one's Davos experience feel almost empty. That said, the man in charge frowns on all the merrymaking. Schwab told the New Yorker that the parties ""detract from what we are doing.""</p> \n<h3>4) So is anything accomplished?</h3> \n<p>You may notice above that we called Davos ""notable"" ... but not important. Indeed, Davos' importance is questioned nearly every year in the media. Bloomberg editor-at-large Tom Keene summed it up in 2014 by <a href=""http://www.marketplace.org/topics/world/davos-does-it-really-matter"">proclaiming the conference</a> ""backward-looking"" and ""pretentious.""</p> \n<p>One of the key criticisms lobbed at Davos is that it is the ultimate illustration of the 1 percent's distance from the rest of the world — that it brings elites together to mingle and discuss the world's problems while comfortably insulated from what the other 99 percent have to say. The Daily Show maybe best lampooned this in a 2014 segment. Inequality was one of the most-discussed themes last year, and Syrian peace talks were going on in nearby Geneva, all of which made for an uncomfortably ironic juxtaposition with the high-profile, high-price partying.</p> \n<p>Of course, attendees say the forum sets the stage for some true productivity, as it puts high-profile businesses, clients, and governments all in one place together, making collaboration easier than perhaps anywhere else.</p> \n<p>""Davos itself doesn’t do anything. But the key word in World Economic Forum is 'forum' — the event provides a platform for powerful people to pursue their distinct interests,"" Eurasia Group President <a href=""http://foreignpolicy.com/2013/01/25/ski-camp/"">Ian Bremmer</a> wrote in a 2013 piece for Foreign Policy. ""Sure, there are people who are just here for the parties and the scene — but you won’t slot them in for a 30-minute meeting.""</p> \n<p>That's not the only reason why the rich and powerful enjoy the summit. FT's <a href=""http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/6a77486c-271a-11e0-80d7-00144feab49a.html"" target=""_blank"">Gillian Tett</a> in 2012 framed Davos as a world in which the wealthy and powerful can cloister themselves away from a world that increasingly distrusts and resents them for being wealthy and powerful.</p> \n<p>""CEOs are uneasily aware that hostility towards elites is rising,"" Tett wrote. As one business leader told her, ""Being a CEO can be a lonely existence in terms of trusting ears and advice, so they come to Davos to meet and talk one-on-one.""</p> \n<p>So maybe in the middle of all the big-thinking and dealmaking, there's also some time for just commiserating.</p> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3327556/160081500.0.jpg"" alt=""Femen Davos protesters"" data-chorus-asset-id=""3327556""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Members of the feminist group Femen protested Davos in 2013. (Getty Images)</p> \n<h3>5) If it's the world forum, is it pretty representative of the world's population?</h3> \n<p>Heavens, no. Representation is heavily skewed toward the rich, first of all, and also geographically toward Western Europe and North America. Those two regions make up nearly two-thirds of all attendees, according to figures on the <a href=""https://agenda.weforum.org/2015/01/infographic-who-is-at-davos-2015/"">World Economic Forum's</a> website.</p> \n<p>Women are also not well represented there. <a href=""http://qz.com/329787/davos-is-still-mostly-a-mens-club/"">Quartz</a> published an excellent graphic showing the lopsided gender distribution at Davos this year, finding that only around 17 percent of all attendees are women.</p> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3327536/women_at_davos_2015.0.png"" alt=""Women Davos"" data-chorus-asset-id=""3327536""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">(<a target=""_blank"" href=""http://qz.com/329787/davos-is-still-mostly-a-mens-club/"">Quartz</a>)</p> \n<p>The WEF is trying to change that, however.

1.2 million American teachers arenâ€™t covered by Social Security,http://www.vox.com/2014/12/18/7402261/social-security-teachers-pension,Here are eight reasons why they should be,"<div class=""chorus-snippet center""> \n<p class=""s-ecnt-intro"">Most of today's debates about Social Security are about taxes or changing how benefits are pegged to inflation by a few tenths of a percentage point. While those things are important, we've mostly ignored the fact that millions of Americans, including 1.2 million public school teachers, are completely denied access to the retirement and disability protections offered by Social Security.  Even if they leave and begin employment that <i>is</i> covered by Social Security, they'll never get Social Security benefits for those years they didn't participate. Instead, they must rely more heavily on under-funded and poorly structured government pension plans and their own personal savings.</p> \n<p>Today, nearly nine out of 10 Americans age 65 and older <a href=""http://www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/statcomps/income_pop55/2012/incpop12.pdf"">depend</a> on Social Security benefits for a comfortable and secure retirement. Among middle- and lower-class Americans, Social Security makes up 43.5 to 83.2 percent of retiree income.  Yet despite its importance and its salience as a political issue, most Americans don't realize that many workers do not participate in Social Security.</p> \n<p>Beginning in the 1950s, state and local governments were given the choice to enroll their workers in Social Security. A minority of states opted not to, on the theory that their state pension plans alone could offer better benefits than a pension plus Social Security. Those states do offer slightly more generous pension formulas to make up for the fact that they don't offer Social Security. But those formulas offer the most significant benefits only to teachers who stay a full career in one place, which most do not. So state pension plans work ok for those teachers — the few who earn the most generous pensions — but they leave everyone else unprotected.</p> \n<p><!-- CHORUS_VIDEO_EMBED ChorusVideo:54740 --></p> \n<br> \n<p>Today, public school teachers remain one of the largest groups of uncovered workers. Nationwide, about 1.2 million teachers (40 percent of all public K-12 teachers) are not covered by Social Security. Those teachers are concentrated in 15 states — Alaska, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Massachusetts, Missouri, Nevada, Ohio, Rhode Island, and Texas — and the District of Columbia, where many or all public school teachers lack coverage.</p> \n<p>In a <a href=""http://www.teacherpensions.org/resource/uncovered-social-security-retirement-uncertainty-and-1-million-teachers"">new report</a> for TeacherPensions.org (where I serve as editor), Leslie Kan and I discuss the history and politics of teachers and Social Security and then examine case studies of teachers at varying experience levels to estimate how much they could benefit from Social Security coverage. While Social Security coverage alone is not an adequate retirement savings plan or a substitute for other teacher retirement initiatives, universal coverage would benefit teachers, states, and the Social Security program itself. Here are 8 reasons why:</p> \n<h3>1) Current teacher retirement plans do not work for most teachers</h3> \n<p>Today's teacher pension plans are not working. Half of all new public school teachers <a href=""http://www.teacherpensions.org/sites/default/files/Bellwether_PensionPaper_070814_Web.pdf"">won't teach long enough</a> to qualify for even a minimal pension benefit, and less than one in five will remain long enough to earn a normal retirement benefit. Even for teachers who do qualify, the structure of the traditional system offers minimal benefits to those who stay for 10, 15, or even 20-plus years. The Urban Institute <a href=""http://www.urban.org/UploadedPDF/413107-How-Long-Must-State-and-Local-Employees-Work-to-Accumulate-Pension-Benefits.pdf"">estimates</a> that, in half of all plans covering public school teachers, teachers must wait at least 24 years (!) before their pension is finally worth more than their own contributions. In a field like teaching where turnover is high, only a small percentage of teachers will make it that long.</p> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2644740/457268148.0.jpg"" alt=""457268148.0.jpg"" data-chorus-asset-id=""2644740""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Having a secure retirement makes teachers happy (Jason Bahr/Getty Images)</p> \n<h3>2) Social Security is the ultimate portable benefit</h3> \n<p>Traditional pensions, which presume that a teacher will stay in a single retirement system for an entire career, have not kept up with changes in the teaching workforce. Fitting with national trends, teachers frequently move within and across sectors. The most common number of years a teacher has served in the profession has dropped from 15 years in 1988 to <a href=""http://www.cpre.org/7trends"">five years today</a>.</p> \n<p>A teacher who moves to another state cannot easily transfer her service years from one state to another. Because states have enacted provisions penalizing teachers who try to withdraw or purchase additional ""service credits,"" a 30-year veteran teacher who moves, even one time, can lose <a href=""http://educationnext.org/golden-handcuffs/"">more than half</a> her net pension wealth, resulting in hundreds of thousands of dollars in lost retirement wealth.</p> \n<p>States could improve their own retirement offerings to workers, but they'll never be able to match the national portability that Social Security provides.</p> \n<h3>3) Social Security would provide all teachers with a solid floor of retirement savings. Teachers of all ages would benefit</h3> \n<p>Retirement savings are often described as a three-legged stool: Social Security, employer retirement plans, and personal savings. The extent of employer-provided benefits will vary by job, and personal savings are a function of financial circumstances, investment returns, and planning foresight. For many American workers, Social Security is the most consistent portion of the three-legged model, providing a minimum threshold and solid plank of social insurance that is portable from job to job. Teachers lacking Social Security face substantial uncertainty and must rely more heavily on their state pension plans and personal savings.</p> \n<p>We model the effects of universal Social Security coverage on young, middle, and full-career teachers in Chicago (see example below for what we called ""Ms. Middle""). Teachers of all ages and experience levels would be net winners from participating in Social Security, even after subtracting out employee and employer contributions. The added security and savings for teachers participating in Social Security would be significant, especially for teachers who currently receive very little from their state pension plan. Most importantly, Social Security would extend retirement benefits to 100 percent of employees, rather than less than half covered under current state pension plans. The result would be greater retirement security for all teachers.</p> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2580832/teacher.0.png"" alt=""teacher.0.png"" data-chorus-asset-id=""2580832""></p> \n<h3>4) Social Security is progressive</h3> \n<p>Unlike state pension plans, which give the most generous benefits to the workers with the highest salaries and the longest work histories, Social Security benefits are progressive. Social Security awards lower-income workers with a greater proportion of benefits relative to their income than it does for higher-income workers. That progressivity would be especially beneficial given the modest salary levels that many teachers face across their working careers.</p> \n<p>In order to preserve the intent behind Social Security's progressive formula, Congress created two provisions to apply to workers who split their careers between covered and uncovered positions. Because teachers and other workers with mixed coverage do not contribute for a full career, upon retirement they would appear to be lower-income than they really were. The two complicated, little-understood provisions-called the Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP) and the Government Pension Offset (GPO)-are  products of inconsistent Social Security coverage. They could be eliminated if all workers were covered by Social Security.</p> \n<div class=""chorus-snippet m-fishtank no-responsive-video""> \n<div data-ad-slot=""athena_features""></div> \n</div> \n<!--  ########  END SNIPPET  ########  --> \n<h3>5) Social Security offers better protection against inflation</h3> \n<p>Social Security bases its benefit formula off a worker's 35 highest-paid years of contributions, and it indexes those earnings and contributions to current dollars. Teacher pensions work differently. They're typically based off a teacher's ""final average salary"" in the last three or five years of employment. The salaries are not inflation-adjusted, meaning teachers have a strong incentive to earn those highest salaries just before they retire. For an early- or mid-career teacher who qualifies for a pension but leaves for another job, her final salary will remain frozen in time. By the time she does retire, her pension will actually be worth far less, in real dollars.</p> \n<p>Teacher pensions typically start receiving inflation adjustments upon retirement. But those are often ad-hoc cost-of-living adjustments (COLAs) that are dependent on market conditions and the whims of state legislators. Social Security benefits, on the other hand, automatically adjust for inflation and do not lose their purchasing power over time. This is a significant advantage for Social Security, given that many state and local pension plans cut their COLAs during recent budget crises.</p> \n<h3>6. Social Security is more than just a retirement program, it also offers superior disability and survivor benefits</h3> \n<p>Currently, workers moving in and out of Social Security face gaps in disability coverage. Social Security Disability Insurance pays monthly cash benefits to people who are disabled and can no longer work, but it requires workers to have at least five years of Social Security employment in the last 10 years. Teachers moving in and out of covered employment face gaps in coverage and may lose out on disability benefits. Additionally, Social Security provides more generous survivor benefits to dependents and spouses than state pension plans do.</p> \n<h3>7. Social Security would lessen the reliance on state pension plans</h3> \n<p>State pension plans in states without Social Security coverage are in worse financial shape than pension plans in other states, leaving uncovered teachers vulnerable to future benefit cuts or increases in their employee contributions. That's exactly what happened in response to the 2007-2009 recession: States cut retirement benefits for new hires by increasing the amount of time workers need to serve before qualifying for a pension, raising the normal retirement age, and reducing benefit formulas.</p> \n<p>Extending Social Security coverage to all workers would reduce the reliance on state pension systems as the sole retirement savings benefit.</p> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2645038/458963142__1_.0.jpg"" alt=""458963142__1_.0.jpg"" data-chorus-asset-id=""2645038""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Happy teachers make happy students (John Leyba/The Denver Post via Getty Images)</p> \n<h3>8) Universal coverage would reduce the long-term Social Security shortfall</h3> \n<p>The Social Security Administration projects that beginning in 2021 it will pay out more benefits than it will have incoming revenue. Its reserves will be depleted within the next 20 years if no reforms are made.</p> \n<p>Extending coverage to all state and local workers would reduce the program's long-term deficit. Studies conducted by the Social Security Administration, the Government Accountability Office, and the 2010 Simpson-Bowles Commission all find that extending coverage to newly hired state and local workers (including teachers) would reduce the long-term shortfall by 8 to 10 percent. This policy change in itself would be sufficient to push off the shortfall for another two to three years.</p> \n<p>Recent figures suggest that millions of Americans face a ""retirement security"" crisis whereby they'll have to work more years or survive on significantly lower incomes, a result of poor savings habits, stagnant wages, and an uneven economy. The failure of retirement saving in the private sector is a result of poor individual decisions and an absence of strong public policies supporting positive saving habits. Teachers, however, suffer from public policies that directly impair their retirement security. It's dreadful public policy to disadvantage the retirement security of 1.2 million public school teachers, a large and important group of college-educated, middle-class public servants.</p> \n</div>",Business & Finance
"Microsoft's new 3D glasses, explained",http://www.vox.com/2015/1/22/7869107/microsofts-3d-glasses-explained,Microsoft hopes its new virtual reality goggles will become a new category of computing device.,"<p>When Marty McFly traveled forward in time to 2015 in the 1989 film <em>Back to the Future II</em>, one of the technological marvels he found in the future was <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ztwns5PkJY"" target=""_blank"">3D glasses</a>. In the movie, they were manufactured by JVC, but Microsoft hopes to make them a reality here in the real world.</p> \n<p>Microsoft's new product, called HoloLens, will allow people to project virtual objects into the real world. Microsoft has developed a new user interface for 3D computing and hopes to create an important new class of computing devices. Microsoft's 3D goggles could be used by architects to visualize new designs, by NASA scientists to explore the surface of Mars, and by business executives for immersive video conferencing.</p> \n<p>Read on for details about Microsoft's new 3D computing platform.</p> \n<h3>What does HoloLens do?</h3> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3327906/a67d3d33-e1e5-4cf7-bf3d-dbe1befc8d8c.0.jpg"" alt=""a67d3d33-e1e5-4cf7-bf3d-dbe1befc8d8c.0.jpg"" data-chorus-asset-id=""3327906""></p> \n<p> </p> \n<p class=""caption"">(Microsoft)</p> \n<p> </p> \n<p>HoloLens is a headset that provides users with an immersive 3D experience. On the most basic level, it works the same way as most other 3D displays: it creates an illusion of depth by displaying an image with a slightly different perspective to each of the user's two eyes. The device plays different sounds in each ear to further heighten the 3D effect.</p> \n<p>What makes the HoloLens different from products that came before is that Microsoft uses complex hardware and software to tightly integrate virtual objects with the real world. The HoloLens glasses are transparent, so people wearing them can see the real world around them, with a variety of virtual objects projected on top.</p> \n<p>And because HoloLens has a sophisticated understanding of the world around it, these objects can interact with the real world too. For example, a virtual TV can appear mounted to the real wall, or virtual objects can seem to rest on a table or floor.</p> \n<h3>So these are not real holograms?</h3> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3327910/maxresdefault.0.jpg"" alt=""maxresdefault.0.jpg"" data-chorus-asset-id=""3327910""></p> \n<p> </p> \n<p class=""caption"">Luke Skywalker discovers R2D2 has a Tupac hologram. (<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZp2D0DuIj0"">Sethward</a>)</p> \n<p> </p> \n<p>If you were expecting a device that can project three-dimensional images the way R2D2 does in <em>Star Wars</em>, you're going to be disappointed. No one has figured out how to make that kind of hologram a reality. Indeed, the recent trend of musicians appearing at concerts as ""holograms"" aren't really holograms either: they're <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/technology/how-the-tupac-hologram-works/2012/04/18/gIQA1ZVyQT_story.html"">two-dimensional images</a> that are projected in a clever way that makes them appear to hover in space.</p> \n<p>The ""holograms"" projected by Microsoft's HoloLens are only visible to the person wearing the 3D glasses. If someone wearing a HoloLens interacts with the objects she sees, it will seem like she's imagining things to someone who isn't wearing a headset of his own.</p> \n<h3>This sounds like a fun technology demo, but is it actually useful?</h3> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3327918/be0a6967-4ec8-4c8b-8bd9-7e840992c462.0.jpg"" alt=""be0a6967-4ec8-4c8b-8bd9-7e840992c462.0.jpg"" data-chorus-asset-id=""3327918""></p> \n<p> </p> \n<p class=""caption"">(Microsoft)</p> \n<p> </p> \n<p>HoloLens isn't just able to project virtual objects into the real world. It also allows users to interact with those objects. HoloLens knows exactly where the user is standing, which way she's moving, and where her hands and fingers are. This likely uses the same 3D sensors that powers Microsoft's popular Kinect gaming platform.</p> \n<p>By tracking the movements of the user's head, the device knows exactly what she's looking at. And HoloLens can respond to voice commands, too.</p> \n<p>Microsoft believes these capabilities will allow people to interact with computers in entirely new ways. Instead of selecting objects with a mouse or touchscreen, users will be able to simply look at a virtual object and then give a verbal command. People can reach out and touch virtual objects, or they can ""pick up"" virtual tools. In one demo, a Microsoft employee uses a virtual spray can to paint a 3-D model.</p> \n<p><iframe frameborder=""0"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/aThCr0PsyuA"" height=""315"" width=""560""></iframe></p> \n<p>Microsoft believes the platform will have important workplace applications. For example, a promotional video shows a woman working on the design for a new motorcycle. She walks over to a real, partially-constructed prototype of the motorcycle and adds a virtual fuel tank on top. Another employee, who is also wearing a HoloLens headset, is able to see the design and suggest changes.</p> \n<p>It's easy to imagine architects, interior designers, and other creative professionals using this kind of technology to show clients immersive 3D models of their designs. And Microsoft says it has been working with NASA to build an immersive 3D model of the Martian landscape around the Mars rovers, allowing scientists on the ground to walk around the virtual Martian landscape and mark items for the rovers to investigate.</p> \n<h3>What are the major HoloLens competitors?</h3> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""3327926"" alt=""a6808c4b-41cf-4c67-94d9-8485142c3530.0.jpg"" src=""https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3327926/a6808c4b-41cf-4c67-94d9-8485142c3530.0.jpg""></p> \n<p> </p> \n<p class=""caption"">(Microsoft)</p> \n<p> </p> \n<p>There are several different companies working on similar 3D products, but each has its own strengths and weaknesses.</p> \n<p>The best-known competitor is Occulus Rift. Facebook bought the company behind this 3D headset last year for $2 billion. The Rift provides an immersive experience similar to that offered by HoloLens, but the company's focus on gaming gives its device somewhat different capabilities. Rift is designed to help users navigate fully virtual worlds. It doesn't have HoloLens's capabilities to project virtual objects in the real world, nor does it have HoloLens's complex user interface.</p> \n<p>One device that <i>can</i> project virtual objects into the real world is <a href=""http://technicalillusions.com/"" target=""_blank"">CastAR</a>, a pair of 3D glasses from the startup Technical Illusions. Like HoloLens, the CastAR glasses are transparent, allowing people to look around at the real world, while virtual images are projected on top of it. <span>Launched as a KickStarter project in 2013, CastAR has begun shipping devices to its earliest backers. It's one of the few 3D products that's independent of any technology company.</span></p> \n<p>Google's Glass is another obvious point of comparison, but Glass isn't a direct competitor to HoloLens. Glass projects information such as travel directions or photographs onto a virtual screen that appears in front of a user's face, but<strong> </strong>Google isn't really in the business of creating immersive virtual worlds.</p> \n<p>That could change, though. Google has <a href=""http://www.wired.com/2014/10/google-magic-leap/"">invested $542 million</a> in a company called Magic Leap that is apparently working on some kind of immersive 3D technology. We'll have to wait and see what the company comes up with.</p> \n<p>A final contender is Intel, which <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/1/9/7520967/intel-realsense-3d-camera"">unveiled a new product line called RealSense</a> last year. By itself, RealSense isn't a competitor to HoloLens and Rift, but Intel's sophisticated 3D cameras and software could serve as important building blocks for other technology companies' 3D products.</p> \n<h3>When will I be able to buy one?</h3> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""3327928"" alt=""d76d1d6c-a4e6-41d2-bc43-c9b49041a219.0.png"" src=""https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3327928/d76d1d6c-a4e6-41d2-bc43-c9b49041a219.0.png""></p> \n<p> </p> \n<p class=""caption"">(Microsoft)</p> \n<p> </p> \n<p>Microsoft is being vague about this.</p> \n<p><span>HoloLens was announced Wednesday</span><strong style=""font-size: 1.15em; line-height: 1.65;""> </strong><span>as part of a </span><a style=""font-size: 1.15em; line-height: 1.65; background-color: #ffffff;"" href=""http://www.theverge.com/2015/1/21/7865539/microsoft-windows-10-event-what-you-need-to-know"">broader presentation</a><span> about Microsoft's forthcoming Windows 10 operating system.

The financial crisis left many Americans without lenders. Raj Date wants to change that.,http://www.vox.com/personal-finance/2015/1/22/7871367/raj-date-mortgage-payday,The former CFPB official wants to change consumer lending. Here's how.,"<p><span>When it comes to places Americans can get a loan, there are the big banks and the government on one end of the spectrum and payday lenders at the other end. Plenty of people could use loans somewhere in the middle, and Raj Date wants to serve them. After spending time on Wall Street and then at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in its infancy, he has struck out on his own. Date is the founder of Fenway Summer, which is trying to provide loans to customers it considers underserved. Date spoke to Vox about trying to find new ways to do student, mortgage, and credit card lending.</span></p> \n<p><strong>DK: Maybe let's start with a rundown of what Fenway Summer does. What makes your firm unique?</strong></p> \n<p>RD: It seemed to me when I left the government two years ago — the nature of that role is that, when you leave you really kind of have a fresh start. Because when you go into the government in a role like that, you shed all your private-sector entanglements, and then when you leave, you really can kind of decide what you want to do from scratch.</p> \n<p>It seemed to me at that time that it was a special moment in US financial services services, and maybe global financial services, because there had been demonstrable unmet needs for real-life people and real-life small businesses out there. There's sort of this ambient background state of annoyingly unmet market needs that would, from time to time, be punctuated by out-and-out market collapse — the bubble in real estate lending and the financial crisis being the most painful and obvious example of that.</p> \n<p>I thought there was a special opportunity to help remake some important ways in which consumer financial services get done in the US. [We wanted to] build a firm that's flexible enough to be able to participate in moving the world from here to there flexibly.</p> \n<p>Specifically in three cases, we thought there was a great market strategy to solve real customer needs out there, but we didn't see any existing team or firm that was doing it. So in those cases — one of them in mortgage, one in credit card, one in student lending — we either sponsored or cosponsored a startup, we recruited the executive team, we helped cobble together the corporate strategy, we seeded the initial capital, and then we kind of pushed.</p> \n<p>And those three businesses we helped to launch are in various stages of existence. Our mortgage company has been up and running for four, five, six months now; our student lender that we cosponsored has been in the market for a little more than a month now; and our credit card firm will launch toward the end of the quarter, sometime this spring.</p> \n<p><strong>DK: You said you want a firm that can move from ""here to there"" flexibly. What are the ""here"" and ""there""?</strong></p> \n<p>RD: The ""here"" is the way in which traditional financial services are delivered. So, for example, the amount of revolving credit that is extended to overdraft customers and to payday loan customers. For the majority of customers who use overdraft and payday, that's actually a pretty inefficient way to secure credit for very real-life demonstrable needs.</p> \n<p>And in the future, by virtue of advances in both distribution efficiency [and] analytics technology, that can be done better. That's the underlying premise of our credit card business. We're finding those payday and overdraft customers who are using those products to basically solve intermittent cash flow crunches, and we're going to be able to give them a product that gives them more utility and at a dramatically better cost.</p> \n<p><strong>DK: Isn't that a tough balance to strike? In the case of non-qualified mortgages or subprime credit card users, is it tougher to say, ""Yes, this person is likely to pay me back""? </strong></p> \n<p>RD: That really is the core of credit intermediation. What's the <i>sine qua non</i> of a financial system that works? It's to serve as an effective and efficient intermediary of payment processes, and it's to serve as an efficient arbiter of credit risk. And credit is a risk. If you want to lend to actual individuals in the US, you have to have a certain risk appetite. And you try to be right as often as you can, but you have to be able to price for those occasions where you're going to be wrong.</p> \n<p><strong>DK: How alone are you in this space? Who are your biggest competitors?</strong></p> \n<p>RD: In general we're trying to solve problems that are not solved well by the marketplace as a whole. So although, for example, our mortgage company certainly provides GSE-eligible loans — after all, it's 85% of the market — over time, you wouldn't expect us to be dramatically better than our biggest rivals. And you have to realize that we are what, one-millionth the size of Wells Fargo. And the world probably doesn't need another commodity provider of GSE loans.</p> \n<p>We deliver good service to our customers, et cetera, but the fact of the matter is we're going to be really distinctive in our ability to deliver loans that other people find too difficult to do. And sometimes it's an advantage to be really focused on a particular set of needs.</p> \n<p><strong>DK: You said the marketplace just hadn't solved this yet. Why hadn't that happened?</strong></p> \n<p>RD: A lot of these things are historical. Markets, over time, are efficient if and only if the the institutions and structures that grew up within them enable that efficiency. And let's take some examples of the places we're focused. So student lending, for example. The way that student lending evolved in the US, the vast majority of originators of student loans originated paper that was going to be guaranteed by the government. As a result, you didn't really have a credit culture develop in student lending.</p> \n<p>A subprime credit card is a little different. It's sort of breathtaking to see how much subprime capacity came out of the market between, say, 2006 and today. And in my opinion, that's why payday lending volumes between the start of the recession and the peak of the recession were flat to, even, up.</p> \n<p>Just think about that. Usually, payday lending volumes should go down in a giant recession, not up. And the reason is you need a job to get a payday loan. And if unemployment doubles, payday lending should come down — but it didn't. They were remarkably resilient. I think a big part of the reason is I think a lot of the capacity for subprime credit card borrowing had been exiting out of the marketplace.</p> \n<p>And so the reason why so much of the existing industry fled the subprime customer in the US had to do with ancillary reasons. For example, the C<a href=""http://www.bankrate.com/finance/credit-cards/8-major-benefits-of-new-credit-card-law-1.aspx"">redit Card Act</a> — which I think was actually a quite good and solid piece of legislation — did in fact lower revenue margins across the business.</p> \n<p>At roughly the same time you had an accounting change [in credit card securitization] ... oh, and by the way, the mortgage business completely fell out of bed.</p> \n<p>If you're running a big bank credit card issuer and it's the year 2008 or 2009, well, gosh — I have a business that suddenly generates less revenue than it used to. It serves customers that actually tend not to be core bank customers. It's way more capital intensive than i thought it was. And by the way, I need more capital because my mortgage business is bleeding.</p> \n<p>Naturally, they almost all simultaneously stopped serving this customer and moved up-market. The unfortunate thing about that is we're talking about three or four deciles of the American population who really have actual credit needs that can be relatively efficiently serviced through this exact product. And that created a hole in the marketplace, and one that we've been able to put together a team and a structure to really get after and solve.</p> \n<p>In a business like financial services, you absolutely need sensible regulations ... but just as important or more important, I think, is that within the context of a regulated industry, you have to have players who are trying to do the right thing, who have a certain cheerful ruthlessness to them.</p> \n<p>And by that I mean when you find a market that is being ill-served, or products that don't seem quite right, you figure out something that's better and you are absolutely ruthless in rolling them out and trying to drive worse products out.</p> \n<p><strong>DK: Is there anything you learned at CFPB that you think is particularly useful in your new job?</strong></p> \n<p>RD: A few things. The first, which is probably the hardest to intuit from the outside, is getting a comfort level with the notion of starting up a new enterprise. [The CFPB] was a difficult thing to pull off operationally ... and we did it. And I think — either rightly or wrongly — that has given me a sense of confidence about the art of the possible, about devising and rolling out new enterprises.</p> \n<p>The second is that I will admit that I was, prior to the CFPB, a lot more familiar with actual customer needs as represented through the icy veneer of an Excel spreadsheet, rather than actually getting out and talking to real-life human beings with real-life problems and real-life triumphs and real-life failures. And that's something that — frankly, it was that kind of cultural attribute that [Elizabeth Warren] really brought to the place. This notion that if you want to be serving the American people, you probably should spend some time with them.</p> \n<p>The third aspect that was striking was, I got to know businesses that I otherwise would not have known at all. My confidence that we can take [market] share from the overdraft and the payday businesses from a well-constructed credit card offering is at least in part grounded in the fact that I got to know the overdraft business reasonably well over the years.</p> \n<p><strong>DK: On a different note, you're on the board at peer-to-peer lender Prosper. P2P isn't super popular just yet in the sense that they're not mainstream, but clearly you're hopeful about it. What do you think is the future of P2P lending?</strong></p> \n<p>RD: I think when you look at the growth rates of Lending Club and Prosper it's hard to argue that they're not catching on. It's been really, really remarkable progress and it's been terrific to be around.</p> \n<p>But when you think about what it takes to deliver, create, and fund quality credit that actually makes someone's life better, you've got to have an efficient way to distribute the product; you have to have an efficient way to make decisions about individual loans; you have to have an efficient way to fund the loan; and you have to have an efficient way to service the loan.</p> \n<p>At every single one of those pieces there are reasons to believe the technology, whether it's analytic technology or mobile distribution, can make things both better from a customer point of view and cheaper. When you can use technology to make something simultaneously better and cheaper, it could be that you've got something going.</p> \n<p><i>This interview has been edited for length and clarity.</i></p>",Business & Finance
The death of the suburbs turns out to be a total myth,http://www.vox.com/2015/1/22/7871687/death-suburbs-myth,The country keeps getting steadily less urban.,"<p>One of my <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/12/31/7470547/bold-predictions-2015"">bold predictions for 2015</a> was that we would see the comeback of suburban sprawl, not so much as a phenomenon but as a cultural trope, as people gradually came to realize that what felt to them like a de-suburbanization trend was a mirage.</p> \n<p>Jed Kolko at Trulia has a bunch of <a href=""http://www.trulia.com/trends/2015/01/cities-vs-suburbs-jan-2015/"">charts that make this point</a> — most forward-looking housing growth in the United States is going to come in the suburbs — but this one is my favorite:</p> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3329240/AgeUrbanComparison.0.0.jpg"" alt=""AgeUrbanComparison.0.0.jpg"" data-chorus-asset-id=""3329240""></p> \n<p>This shows that at almost every age level, the country continued to <em>de-urbanize</em> from 2000 to 2013. Various <a href=""http://www.phillymag.com/news/2013/08/08/prodigal-parents-empty-nesters-rejoin-adult-children/"">trend pieces</a> about <a href=""http://www.boston.com/realestate/news/2012/08/18/empty-nesters-are-urban-pioneers-suburban-friends/ALrhSd9qqEk20XOXwLc48M/story.html"">empty nesters moving</a> to <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/2013/08/05/1a21c1b2-fba7-11e2-a369-d1954abcb7e3_story.html"">the big city</a> simply aren't reflected in the data.</p> \n<p>So does this all mean that cities are terrible and everyone hates them?</p> \n<p>Not at all. For one thing, the national population is growing so it is possible for urban areas to experience population growth even as the <em>urban share</em> of the population declines. For another thing, prices matter. If people hated city living, then Manhattan apartments would be cheap rather than expensive. In reality, they are expensive. But most expensive downtowns make it relatively difficult to secure permission to add more housing units. And expensive inner-ring suburbs generally make it illegal to transform detached house neighborhoods into more urban townhouse neighborhoods even when market conditions and geography suggest that would be smart.</p> \n<p>But the facts are what they are — cities aren't necessarily losing people the way they were in the 1970s and 1980s, but the trajectory of American housing growth is still all about the suburbs, driven by a mix of consumer tastes and entrenched policies that favor suburbanization.</p>",Business & Finance
Read McDonald's workers' shocking harassment and discrimination complaints â€” and why they're so important,http://www.vox.com/2015/1/22/7873661/mcdonalds-lawsuit-harassment-discrimination,A new lawsuit alleges shocking behavior by McDonald's supervisors could call into question the nature of the franchisor-franchisee relationship,"<p>Ten current and former McDonald's workers filed suit in a Virginia district court on Thursday, alleging racial discrimination and sexual harassment at McDonald's locations in two Virginia cities.</p> \n<p>In one store, for example, one supervisor allegedly would say it was ""too dark in the store"" at times when most workers were African-American. And the suit goes on to list some almost unfathomably degrading behavior on the part of supervisors:</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>Plaintiffs were subjected to rampant racial and sexual harassment, committed by the restaurants' highest-ranking supervisors. Together, these supervisors demeaned African American workers; often complained that ""there are too many black people in the store;"" called African-American workers ""bitch,"" ""ghetto,"" and ""ratchet;"" called Hispanic workers ""dirty Mexican;"" disciplined African-American employees for rule infractions that were forgiven when committed by white employees; inappropriately touched female employees on their legs and buttocks; sent female employees sexual pictures; and solicited sexual relations from female employees.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>The allegations in the lawsuit are of course shocking on a basic level. But this suit is also important in a much subtler way, in that it's filed against both Soweva — the franchisee operating these stores — and the McDonald's corporation itself. Far more than being a simply discrimination and harassment suit, this case is another example of a question that has repeatedly been raised in labor law in the last year — when is an big chain a ""joint employer"" of people who work for one of its franchises?</p> \n<p>In other words, can McDonald's and other corporations be held legally accountable for the working conditions endured by front-line employees who wear their uniforms but are technically employees of independently owned franchises? This seemingly pedantic question actually has broad implications for many franchise-heavy industries (fast food, hotels, gyms) and how they relate to their workers — how they schedule employees and negotiate with unions, for example.</p> \n<h3>A bigger, nationwide debate</h3> \n<p>The franchising debate has heated up with a few high-profile cases. In California, for example, the supreme court <a href=""http://blogs.orrick.com/employment/2014/09/30/dominos-delivers-key-ruling-in-favor-of-franchisors/"" target=""_blank"">last year</a> ultimately ruled in favor of Domino's Pizza, saying it was not a joint employer along with its franchise operators. A <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/12/19/7420729/nlrb-browning-ferris-employer"">yet-to-be-decided case</a> before the National Labor Relations Board questions whether a waste management company is an employer along with its subcontractors. And in December, the NLRB decided to authorize complaints against both franchise operators and the McDonald's parent company, alleging retaliation against employees who participated in protests demanding $15-per-hour wages. Even though that was a preliminary decision, it was considered a big win for labor-rights advocates.</p> \n<p>These sorts of cases could strike at the heart of the franchisor-franchisee relationship, in which the franchisee runs the business according to certain specifications set by the parent company but operates independently in many other ways, like in how it treats its employees. That often means a franchisee acts as a sort of buffer between workers and the parent corporation.</p> \n<p>But the question of joint employership is being reconsidered lately. The NLRB, for example, <a href=""http://www.whitecase.com/files/Publication/65ab18cc-ecf9-4c2f-9719-4642b26cb61c/Presentation/PublicationAttachment/5cccd1d1-a9c9-4660-9dd3-4a7a8475ece5/would-you-like-joint-employer-liability-mcdonalds-serves-cautionary-tal.pdf"">appears willing</a> to reconsider that definition, which currently says an employer must have ""direct and immediate impact"" on the terms and conditions of workers' employment — for example, having a say in hiring and firing, as well as wage-setting.</p> \n<p>In this case, plaintiffs are saying that McDonald's is partially liable because it had so much control over its stores. The lawsuit references McDonald's' detailed training manuals, control over menus, and routine visits from McDonald's mystery shoppers as examples of the parent company's control over stores. And in a call with reporters, plaintiff Katrina Stanfield said she complained to McDonald's about the harassment and discrimination and that they did nothing in response.</p> \n<h3>The repercussions of a new definition could be huge</h3> \n<p>According to one attorney, when the definition is murky, it makes operating those businesses difficult.</p> \n<p>""If you don't know who the employer is, you can't allocate liability, and you really don't know how to run your business,"" says Michael Lotito, co-chair of the Workplace Policy Institute at law firm Littler Mendelson.</p> \n<p>And if pending cases do indeed find parent companies to be liable for their franchisees' wrongdoings, it could have repercussions far beyond McDonald's. <span>And the broader question of what, exactly, is an ""employer"" could even affect the relationships between, for example, retailers and suppliers, as well as employers and staffing agencies. </span><span>Of course, neither the NLRB nor Virginia's District Court has the last word. Settling this question could be a years-long process, says Lotito, and decisions could differ from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. And given that groups like SEIU and Fast Food Forward are fighting hard on this question, expect to hear more about the joint employer issue in the years to come.</span></p>",Business & Finance
Here's what's sending SkyMall into bankruptcy â€” and what could save it,http://www.vox.com/2015/1/23/7878241/skymall-bankruptcy,"Your favorite in-flight catalog's parent company is entering bankruptcy.

Xhibit, the parent company of SkyMall, filed for bankruptcy today.</p> \n<p>The catalog's revenues had fallen off dramatically in the last year, from $33.7 million in 2013 to $15.8 million for the nine months ending in September, the <a href=""http://www.wsj.com/articles/in-flight-catalog-skymall-files-for-bankruptcy-1422025308"">Wall Street Journal</a> reports. If it can't find another buyer, flyers might soon have one less distraction on their cramped flights.</p> \n<p>But as one catalog inches toward the grave, another is being reborn — <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://time.com/money/3675139/j-c-penney-catalog-bringing-back/"">JCPenney</a> this week announced it's bringing its catalog back. And taken together, the two stories provide a glimpse into what makes a catalog work in a digital world. As retailers are increasingly understanding, a catalog can work, but only if you use it with other channels — websites, email, stores — to drive customers to spend more.</p> \n<p>Let's start with SkyMall. Maybe the biggest reason it's failing is that it has been losing its biggest advantage: its captive audience. As the blog <a href=""http://priceonomics.com/skymalls-skyfall/"">Priceonomics</a> wrote in 2013, SkyMall has worked out a deal with major US airlines to be their sole in-flight catalog. That gives SkyMall access to 90 percent of the flying market — according to the <a href=""http://www.directactionmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/downloads/2013/09/SkyMall_MediaKit2014.pdf"" target=""_blank"">company's figures</a>, it had the potential to reach 1.8 million passengers <i>each day — </i>665 million per year<i>. </i>Crate &amp; Barrel and Pottery Barn would kill for that kind of reach for all the catalogs they instead jam into your mailbox.</p> \n<p>""With the increased use of electronic devices on planes, fewer people browsed the SkyMall inflight catalog,"" the company wrote in its filing. With air carriers increasingly offering internet access, plus the FAA's decision to allow us to use our cell phones during take-off and landing, and you have people reading the news or shopping online instead of buying <a href=""http://www.skymall.com/grillbot-automatic-grill-cleaning-robot/28025GRP.html"">grill Roombas</a>.</p> \n<p>Skymall knew this was a problem. In its bankruptcy filing, the company said it wanted to start relying less on catalog sales and start attracting more customers online, as <a href=""http://mashable.com/2015/01/23/skymall-declare-bankruptcy/"">Mashable reports</a>.</p> \n<p>In other words, it wanted to become a company where you go to its website when you're just sitting around browsing at home, not just after you've found something you like on an airplane. Though the company sells its goods online, the company says <a href=""http://www.directactionmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/downloads/2013/09/SkyMall_MediaKit2014.pdf"">70 percent</a> of those sales are ""driven by"" catalog readership — and those catalog readers were going away.</p> \n<p>Unfortunately, Skymall wasn't able to shift to this online-focused strategy quickly enough to ward off bankruptcy. According to <a href=""http://www.xhibitcorp.com/investors.html"">the filing</a>, the company tried to ""reduce its dependence on its in-flight catalog business and to reposition SkyMall as a direct retailer in the e-commerce space,"" but that ""operational and liquidity challenges"" got in the way. The company failed in several attempts to get more capital to beef up its online presence at the end of 2014, the filing says.</p> \n<p>At the same time Skymall has been imploding, some other catalogs have been staging a comback. In 2013, <a href=""http://www.wsj.com/articles/j-c-penney-resurrects-its-catalog-1421695574"">retailers</a> sent out 11.9 billion catalogs in the US, the first uptick since 2007, but also down from nearly 20 billion sent out in 2007, according to the Wall Street Journal. And that's in part because retailers have increasingly figured out how to use catalogs to their advantage.</p> \n<p>For an example of this, look no further than one resurrected catalog: JC Penney. That retailer announced just this week that it's bringing its catalog back from the dead. Yes, catalogs take money to print and distribute, but they also bring customers in. In a <a href=""http://www.kurtsalmon.com/uploads/KurtSalmonReview.Is%20The%20Catalog%20Dead%20Not%20In%20An%20Omnichannel%20World.pdf"">recent report</a>, retail consulting firm Kurt Salmon found that eliminating catalogs in an effort to cut costs can backfire for a retailer, because it engages customers so much less. Meanwhile, customers engaging with a retailer on multiple platforms (online, with catalogs, in stores) also spent a lot more. This is part of what retailers call an ""omnichannel"" strategy — using several mediums simultaneously to attract customers. And it makes intuitive sense: encourage customers to find your goods in a variety of ways and places, and they'll both remember you and keep coming back.</p> \n<p>Skymall, of course, doesn't have brick and mortar outlets like a JCPenney or a Land's End, nor does it mail its catalogs to millions of people. Which might have made a bigger online strategy all the more important.</p> \n<p>It's hard to know exactly what its online strategy might have looked like — more online advertising? more email marketing? — not to mention how well the company can even compete in the e-commerce space. But if it is going to survive bankruptcy, its new buyer might want to take note: there's a way to make a catalog work, and it's to make your business about far more than a catalog.</p>",Business & Finance
How 3D glasses could make televisions obsolete,http://www.vox.com/2015/1/24/7879257/Microsoft-hololens-televisions-obsolete,"Technologies like Microsoft HoloLens could transform how we watch movies, TV shows, and sports.","<p>In its Wednesday presentation unveiling the new<span> </span><a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/1/22/7869107/microsofts-3d-glasses-explained"" style=""font-size: 17px; line-height: 28.4624996185303px; background-color: #ffffff;"">HoloLens 3D headset</a><span>, Microsoft showed off a number of exotic applications, from exploring the surface of Mars to designing a drone. </span><span>But one of the most important applications for HoloLens — and other 3D glasses that will inevitably rise up to compete with it — may be something much closer to home: making televisions obsolete.</span></p> \n<p><span>Instead of watching movies or TV shows on a physical television, families will be able to watch them on a virtual screen floating in the air in front of them.</span></p> \n<p>That might seem silly, but 3D glasses will have some significant advantages over a conventional television. Most obviously, the virtual television projected by 3D glasses will be able to display 3D images. More importantly, virtual televisions can be really big — transforming every living room, no matter how cramped, into a virtual movie theater. <span>Or people might dispense with screens altogether, dropping viewers right into a middle of a virtual movie set or football game. </span><span>At the same time, because HoloLens is transparent, it won't isolate families who are watching a show together the way older 3D goggles would have done.</span></p> \n<h3>Augmented reality means you can still interact with friends and family</h3> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3334098/9944456026_c19f7592d3_o.0.jpg"" alt=""9944456026_c19f7592d3_o.0.jpg"" data-chorus-asset-id=""3334098""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">CastAR glasses pioneered augmented reality. (<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/mirka23/9944456026"">Rachel Lovinger</a>)</p> \n<p>Traditional VR headsets completely block out the real world, immersing you in a virtual world instead. This, of course, makes them a poor choice for a family movie night. For most of us, watching movies, TV shows, and sports is a social experience, and it would be a lot less fun if each of us was isolated in our own virtual world.</p> \n<p>But HoloLens and its competitor CastAR are a little different. They're ""augmented reality"" glasses, not ""virtual reality"" glasses. That means the glasses are transparent, so by default you can still see the real world around you. But virtual objects are projected onto the glasses in a way that makes them look like solid objects that exist in the real world. If an object is sitting on top of a table, it seems to stay in the same position on the table, even as you walk around it.</p> \n<p>This makes the technology a lot more appealing for collective video viewing. If everyone is wearing a pair of HoloLens glasses, then everyone can be looking at a virtual screen that looks like it's in the same place and showing the same movie. That means they can laugh at jokes together the same way they would with a normal TV, share a bowl of popcorn, and so forth.</p> \n<h3>3D TVs haven't taken off yet, but that could still change</h3> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3334090/wizard_of_oz.0.jpg"" alt=""wizard_of_oz.0.jpg"" data-chorus-asset-id=""3334090""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Color was once seen as a gimmick rather than a standard filmmaking technique. (MGM)</p> \n<p>An obvious advantage of 3D glasses like HoloLens is that they can automatically show video in 3D. Of course, some recent TVs can do that too, and the feature has <a href=""http://www.theverge.com/2013/6/12/4422874/espn-3d-to-shut-down-by-end-of-2013"">totally flopped</a> with consumers.</p> \n<p>One big reason for that is that there's relatively little 3D content available right now. Right now, shooting in 3D requires special equipment that's expensive and hard to operate. This creates a chicken-and-egg problem: with little 3D content available, consumers aren't that interested in 3D TVs. And that means it doesn't make sense for content producers to spend a lot of money creating 3D content.</p> \n<p>But rapid progress in 3D cameras is likely to change that. Last year, Intel <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/1/9/7520967/intel-realsense-3d-camera"">unveiled a new line of 3D cameras</a> aimed at the consumer market. It's only a matter of time before these same technologies become powerful enough for the pros to use. At that point, shooting in 3D will barely be more expensive than shooting conventional 2D video.</p> \n<p>Right now, people think of 3D as a gimmick. But as Vox's entertainment writer Todd VanDerWerff pointed out to me, people once considered movies with sound and color to be gimmicks too. That changed as the technology matured and costs came down.</p> \n<p>And remember, 3D TVs require you to wear 3D glasses. If you're going to wear glasses anyway, why not just use ones that don't require a TV in the first place?</p> \n<h3>3D glasses will turn your living room into a virtual movie theater</h3> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3334056/Screen-Shot-2015-01-21-at-4.32.51-PM.0.png"" alt=""Screen-Shot-2015-01-21-at-4.32.51-PM.0.png"" data-chorus-asset-id=""3334056""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">(Microsoft)</p> \n<p>TVs have gotten bigger over the years, especially as the industry switched from old-fashioned cathode-ray tube TVs to modern flat-screen ones. Still, there are inherent limits to how big TVs can get. Huge TVs — even flat-screen ones — are heavy, they're expensive to manufacture, and they take up a lot of space in your living room.</p> \n<p>Virtual TV screens can be as large as you want them to be. They can appear to take over an entire wall in your house, giving you the same wide field of vision you get in a movie theater. They can appear suspended in the air in front of your bookshelves. Even better, they can create the illusion of being farther away than the dimensions of your actual living room. If your couch is 15 feet from the wall, it can look like there's a big hole in the wall leading to a screen 50 feet away.</p> \n<p>And eventually, content creators might drop the idea of ""screens"" altogether. One of Microsoft's demos this week illustrates how this might work. Working with NASA, Microsoft has <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GP3Kx6-CE"">recreated a 360 degree view of the Martian surface</a>. The NASA employee's desk appeared to be sitting in the middle of the Martian landscape.</p> \n<p>Similarly, 3D content of the future could fully surround viewers — it could look like your couch was sitting in the middle of the movie set.</p> \n<p>This could be a huge selling point for sports fans. The NFL could mount cameras on a crane or drone over a football field, creating the illusion that a viewer's armchair is hovering over the field. Tennis fans could feel like they're sitting right next to the net, and hockey fans would have the best virtual seats in the arena.</p> \n<h3>3D glasses will get a lot smaller, lighter, and cheaper</h3> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3334222/3650987197_019189121e_b.0.jpg"" alt=""3650987197_019189121e_b.0.jpg"" data-chorus-asset-id=""3334222""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">(<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/artefactgroup/3650987197"">Artefact Group</a>)</p> \n<p><span>An obvious objection is that people aren't going to want to spend their evenings wearing giant, dorky-looking headsets. But these headsets won't look dorky forever. As the technology matures, the components will get smaller, lighter, and more power-efficient, just as cell phones have. Eventually, 3D glasses won't weigh much more than the normal glasses many of us wear every day.</span></p> \n<p>Microsoft hasn't even announced a release date or price for its new product, but it's likely to be pricey. Microsoft's Kinect Sensor costs $150 to $250; HoloLens headsets combine Kinect-style sensors with several other components, so they're likely to cost even more. The average family of four is unlikely to spend upwards of a thousand dollars just to watch 3D movies.</p> \n<p>But like most high-tech gadgets, these devices are likely to get dramatically cheaper over time. Eventually, they'll be cheap enough that most households can afford to own several, just as many households today have a collection of iPods, smartphones, and tablets.</p>",Business & Finance
Union membership in 2014 is half of what it was 30 years ago,http://www.vox.com/2015/1/26/7887121/US-union-membership,"In 1983, 1 in 5 workers were union members.

It's the latest indicator that the waning influence of Big Labor in the American workforce is going to continue. So while both political parties grapple with what to do about stagnant wages and inequality, unions is looking less and less likely to be the answer.</p> \n<p>In 2014, there were nearly 14.6 million union members in the US, up by only around 50,000 from 2013.

Indeed, 35.7 percent of public-sector workers today are members, compared to 6.6 percent for private-sector.</p> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/675824/Screen_Shot_2014-08-29_at_10.29.02_AM.0.png"" alt=""Pew public and private unions"" data-chorus-asset-id=""675824""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">(<a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/02/20/for-american-unions-membership-trails-far-behind-public-support/"">Pew Research Center</a>)</p> \n<p>What's dragging unions down? That's a topic of intense debate. The rise of right-to-work laws in some states is often blamed, along with laws that restrict union activities, like the 2011 Wisconsin law prohibiting many types of collective bargaining on the part of public-sector unions. <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/4/18/5627630/occupational-licensing-is-replacing-labor-unions-and-exacerbating"">One theory</a> from economists Alan Krueger and Morris Kleiner links shrinking unions with the rise of occupational licensing.

Syriza frames its opposition to this situation mostly in terms of rejecting the substantive economic prescriptions, while the Independent Greeks frame it mostly in nationalistic terms.

This <a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/eurozone-crisis/what-is-the-eurozone"">bolsters the Eurozone as a political project</a>, and also helps avoid spreading panic to other Eurozone states.</p> \n<p>But the debt has not been forgiven or wiped out.</p> \n<p>Unlike (say) the bailout of American banks in 2008, the bailout of the Greek government has come with a lot of conditions.

The complicating factor is that if Syriza triumphs, it will encourage voters to <a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/eurozone-crisis/podemos-spain"">turn to the far left in Spain and elsewhere</a>, which European elites very much do not want to see happen.

Why Chipotle is handing out free burritos for the next month,http://www.vox.com/2015/1/26/7909133/chipotle-free-burrito, ,"<p>Yes, you need more <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/4/25/5653390/chipotle-s-calorie-labels-are-a-lie"">fattening burritos</a> in your life. And you're in luck: today is Chipotle's big free burrito promotion. If you go into the store today and order one of the company's sofritas (read: tofu) menu items, you can keep your receipt and bring it back for a free burrito in the next month.</p> \n<p>Yes, it's a food giveaway, but you can see how this would be great business for the company, for a few reasons. One is that it gets lots of people in the door today, and a lot of those people are bound to lose their receipts or simply forget about the promotion within the next month. Consider that redemption rates for coupons are fantastically low at retailers. According to retail technology company <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://go.inmar.com/rs/inmar/images/Inmar_2014_Coupon_Trends_Report.pdf"">Inmar</a>, only around 6.6 percent of on-receipt coupons (think those coupons you get on your super-long CVS receipts) were redeemed in 2012. That's not quite the same as what Chipotle is doing, but even if Chipotle's customers happen to redeem far more of their receipts than consumers usually do, it still signals that Chipotle probably won't have to hand out nearly all the free burritos it promises today.</p> \n<p><q class=""right"" aria-hidden=""true"">Chipotle won't end up handing out nearly all the free burritos it promises today</q></p> \n<p>Another is that it gets people to try the company's relatively unpopular sofritas — as of <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.esquire.com/blogs/food-for-men/free-chipotle-with-sofritas"">July last year</a>, sofritas accounted for only only 3.5 percent of the company's sales. This seems particularly important as the company comes away from a meat supply snafu. Earlier this month, <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/15/business/after-suspending-supplier-chipotle-takes-pork-off-menu-in-600-stores.html"">Chipotle found</a> that one of its pork suppliers had violated the restaurant's animal welfare standards, causing Chipotle to pull its carnitas filling from 600 restaurants. <span>Tofu is also often cheaper than meat (that said, </span><a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/emily-cohn/chipotle-tofu-sofritas_b_4906496.html"" style=""font-size: 1.15em; line-height: 1.65; background-color: #ffffff;"">Chipotle insists</a><span> it has similar margins on tofu as it does to chicken).</span></p> \n<p>And promoting its meat-free options is also a brand-building exercise for the company. Chipotle has made humanely-raised meat a big part of its brand (something that the carnitas shortage, unfortunate as it was for the company, helped promote). Hawking its non-meat burrito filling only helps to bolster its animal-friendly image.</p> \n<p>It could also be a hard sell to get more Americans to choose tofu over meat. According to Gallup, only 5 percent of Americans identified as vegetarian in 2012, and 2 percent were vegan. Then again, Americans' meat consumption has <a href=""http://www.npr.org/blogs/thesalt/2012/06/27/155527365/visualizing-a-nation-of-meat-eaters"" target=""_blank"">started to fall off</a> in recent years, meaning Chipotle might be able to interest Americans trying to cut back on their animal-eating.</p>",Business & Finance
It's not just hype: Microsoft's HoloLens really could be the next big thing,http://www.vox.com/2015/1/26/7915201/microsoft-hololens-big-deal,"HoloLens makes the real world its user interface, making possible apps that couldn't exist otherwise.","<p>When Microsoft unveiled HoloLens, its new 3D glasses, last week, it released this video of developers singing the technology's praises:</p> \n<p><iframe width=""560"" height=""315"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/aAKfdeOX3-o"" frameborder=""0""></iframe></p> \n<p>""This is the next generation of computing,"" one guy says. ""This is the next PC.""</p> \n<p>It's always worth taking a claim like this with a grain of salt. But this one has a good chance of being true.</p> \n<p>When Steve Jobs unveiled the iPhone in 2007, he pointed out that great new computing platforms are often defined by revolutionary user interfaces — the mouse in the 1980s, multitouch computing in the 2000s. In each case, users got a new way of interacting with computers that opened up potential applications that wouldn't have been practical otherwise.</p> \n<p>So what's the next great computing platform going to be? Several big tech companies are now betting that it will involve some kind of wearable virtual reality experience. Facebook bought <a href=""https://www.oculus.com/"">Occulus VR</a>, makers of the Rift 3D headset, last year. Google has been working on Glass, and has also invested millions in a VR startup called <a href=""http://www.wired.com/2014/10/google-magic-leap/"">Magic Leap</a>. Intel is building a line of 3D cameras called <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/1/9/7520967/intel-realsense-3d-camera"">RealSense</a>. Sony is working on a gaming headset called <a href=""http://www.sony.com/SCA/company-news/press-releases/sony-computer-entertainment-america-inc/2014/sony-computer-entertainment-announces-project-morp.shtml"">Project Morpheus</a>. And now Microsoft has HoloLens.</p> \n<p>Products like the Occulus Rift and Project Morpheus completely take over the user's field of vision. That might be good for gaming, but it's going to be a deal-breaker for most other applications. In contrast, HoloLens seamlessly inserts virtual objects into the physical world. That not only makes the device less awkward to use around other people, since you can still see and interact with them. It creates a whole new class of potential applications by essentially turning the real world into a user interface for HoloLens apps.</p> \n<p>The success of smartphones and tablets is partly due to their touchscreen interface, but it's also because they're mobile devices with a variety of sensors (cameras, GPS, accelerometer) that allowed them to interact with the physical world in ways that PCs never could. A turn-by-turn direction app isn't very useful on a PC that never leaves your desk.</p> \n<p>Similarly, HoloLens has unique capabilities that lets it do things that smartphones and PCs can't. For example, <a href=""http://youtu.be/aThCr0PsyuA?t=1m8s"" target=""new"">one of Microsoft's demos</a> involves a father walking her daughter through a plumbing project over Skype. The father used his tablet to ""draw"" arrows in three dimensions to tell the daughter exactly where to put the part. That's made possible by the combination of 3D glasses and a sophisticated understanding of the physical world in front of the user.</p> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3342332/Microsoft-HoloLens-Skype-RGB.0.png"" alt=""Microsoft-HoloLens-Skype-RGB.0.png"" data-chorus-asset-id=""3342332""></p> \n<p>It's not hard to think of other ways this could be useful. People who buy goods online will not only be able to see life-size 3D models; they'll be able to place those models in their house. You'll be able to see exactly how that new chair will look next to your existing furniture, and how your bedroom will look with a new paint color. Not only will your cake recipe float in the air over your kitchen counter, but the software may be smart enough to check off each ingredient as you add it to the bowl and warn you if you forget one. And devices like HoloLens could have <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/1/24/7879257/Microsoft-hololens-televisions-obsolete"">huge implications</a> for home entertainment.</p> \n<p>These applications are still several years away, at least. Microsoft is being vague about when HoloLens will be available to the public, and there's no guarantee that it will be a hit. Some other company  might take the same basic idea and execute it better. But there's every reason to think that HoloLens or something like it will be a big, important computing platform in the next decade.</p>",Business & Finance
Tech pundits like me hated the iPad â€” and that's exactly why it worked,http://www.vox.com/2015/1/27/7921007/ipad-five-year-hit,"When the iPad was unveiled five years ago, I thought it would flop. Here's what I missed.","<p>Steve Jobs first unveiled the iPad five years ago today. And I didn't like it.</p> \n<p>""I don’t understand who this product is marketed for,"" I <a href=""http://timothyblee.com/2010/01/27/the-case-against-the-ipad/"">griped</a>. ""And I’m disappointed that Apple has decided to adopt the iPhone’s locked-down platform strategy.""</p> \n<p>We all know what happened next: the iPad was a huge hit. And my argument looks kind of silly in retrospect.</p> \n<p>In a sense, though, my negative reaction to the iPad perfectly illustrates why the iPad was successful. The iPad wasn't designed for people like me who spend all day in front of a computer. It was designed for more casual users who value simplicity and convenience over power-user features. And there are a lot more of them than there are people like me.</p> \n<h3>Less is more</h3> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""3345140"" alt=""170488829.0.jpg"" src=""https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3345140/170488829.0.jpg""></p> \n<p> </p> \n<p class=""caption"">(MyLoupe/UIG via Getty Images)</p> \n<p> </p> \n<p>The genius of the iPad was precisely that it had fewer features than a conventional PC. Most obviously, it didn't have a keyboard and mouse. It also didn't have standard ports for external peripherals and displays. And it didn't have a hard drive; its flash-based storage was a lot smaller than you could get on a laptop at the time.</p> \n<p>The iPad software, a scaled-up version of the iPhone operating system, was more limited than PC software, too. The iPad doesn't let you have multiple, overlapping windows on the screen. It doesn't let you install software from any source other than Apple's app store. Internally, the iPad stored data in the same basic files-and-folders system as conventional PCs, but unlike on a PC the user couldn't access the file system directly.</p> \n<p>For power users, these were intolerable limitations. We like our keyboards, our large hard drives, and the ability to have many windows open at once. <span>But for ordinary users, the complexity of a PC offers little benefit. Most people spend more time reading content than writing it, so the lack of a keyboard isn't a big issue. They almost never installed third-party PC software, so limitations on doing this didn't bother them. And a lot of users never really understood their PC's file system anyway, so they don't miss it. The touch-based interface, which seems terribly limiting to power users, seems refreshingly straightforward to everyone else.</span></p> \n<p>Stripping away these features allowed Apple to make the iPad, smaller, lighter, and cheaper than a full-powered PC. Removing the ability to install third-party software — and tightly controlling what makes it into the app store — makes the iPad less vulnerable to spyware and viruses. Eliminating access to the file system ensures users won't accidentally cause configuration problems by deleting important files.</p> \n<p>Steve Jobs's genius was recognizing that making a successful mobile operating system required a clean break. Only by abandoning much of the complexity of Mac OS X could he create an operating system simple enough to work well on a tiny, underpowered smartphone. And that same simplicity made the iPhone's larger cousin, the iPad, more appealing to ordinary users.</p> \n<p>This is an issue Microsoft is still struggling with. Microsoft had already been <a href=""http://news.microsoft.com/2001/11/11/gates-showcases-tablet-pc-xbox-at-comdex-says-new-digital-decade-technologies-will-transform-how-we-live/"" target=""_blank"">trying to create successful tablet software</a> for close to a decade when Apple introduced the iPad in 2010. And the software giant is still struggling to get consumers to buy its Surface tablets.</p> \n<p>But <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/5/21/5738560/what-microsoft-doesnt-get-about-the-tablet-revolution"">Microsoft has been hobbled</a> by its attempts to build on its existing Windows franchise. By attempting to shoehorn all the features of a PC into a tablet, Microsoft has produced products that are too complex, confusing, and costly for the ordinary consumers who love their iPads. At the same time, most users who want the full power of a PC are just going to buy a PC.</p> \n<p>I eventually bought an iPad, but I almost never use it. I did an informal survey of my Vox colleagues found that hardly any of them use iPads or other tablets either. But most of our parents have iPads and they love them. Many of our siblings do too.</p> \n<h3>iPad sales have plateaued</h3> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""3345136"" alt=""96212378.0.jpg"" src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3345136/96212378.0.jpg""></p> \n<p> </p> \n<p class=""caption"">(Ryan Anson/AFP/Getty Images)</p> \n<p> </p> \n<p>After a couple of years of skyrocketing sales, sales plateaued around 2013. It has become fashionable to <a href=""http://www.wired.com/2015/01/ipad-went-massive-meh-5-short-years/"">dismiss the device</a> for failing to meet the lofty expectations set during its wildly successful early years. But the fact remains that the iPad is a huge hit; Apple sells about 60 million iPads per year, three times the number of Macs the company sells.</p> \n<p>Yet the iPad's position as a device for non-power users also explains why it hasn't reached the heights of the iPhone, which sold 160 million units during Apple's last fiscal year. The iPad primarily appeals to casual users; the iPhone appeals to everyone. And the casual users who are drawn to the iPad are the type of people who don't feel the need to buy the latest and greatest every couple of years. Now that almost everyone who wants an iPad has one, it'll be hard to convince people to upgrade.</p> \n<p>Steve Jobs once <a href=""http://allthingsd.com/20130109/steve-jobs-was-right-tablets-are-cars-pcs-are-trucks/"">compared PCs to trucks</a> — there will always be some people who demand heavy-duty equipment for heavy-duty needs.

What Greece's new finance minister learned from studying video games,http://www.vox.com/2015/1/28/7924485/yannis-varoufakis-video-games,General equilibrium doesn't work.,"<p>Greece's new finance minister is well-known heterodox economist Yannis Varoufakis. Before he got into Greek politics, though, Varoufakis was standing out from the pack by working as an in-house economist for the video game company, Valve.</p> \n<p>This may seem odd, but the video-game work is actually extremely relevant to his new gig. Indeed, Varoufakis was originally hired by Valve because of his work on the economics of European monetary union. Valve operates several different games that have their own in-game economies, and the company wanted to link them and provide a unified medium of exchange — essentially a virtual equivalent of the creation of the euro. <a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/eurozone-crisis/eurozone-crisis-origin"">Europe basically botched this</a>, so Valve brought in an economist to try to manage it better.</p> \n<p>But once at Valve, Varoufakis also studied the in-game economies in ways that are relevant to Greece's several economic recession. As <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2012/09/28/the-economics-of-video-games/"">Brad Plumer explained back in 2012</a>:</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>Consider, for example, the concept of arbitrage. Economic theory suggests that markets will usually tend toward equilibrium — if there’s an opportunity for someone to buy low and sell high, enough people will do it that these imbalances will disappear. This is difficult to track in real life. Yet this summer, while working for Valve, Varoufakis <a href=""http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fblogs.valvesoftware.com%2Feconomics%2Farbitrage-and-equilibrium-in-the-team-fortress-2-economy%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFxGA8xP-Ao8hO40nyyALnqFUV8qA"">used data</a> from the game Team Fortress 2 to measure how often this actually happened. As it turned out, the economy can veer far from equilibrium surprisingly often.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Interesting, but so what?</p> \n<p>Well, Europe is in the midst of an economic malaise that's actually <a href=""http://equitablegrowth.org/2014/08/21/nighttime-must-read-matt-obrien-worse-1930s-europes-recession/"">worse than the Great Depression</a> by some measures. And the question of equilibrium is one of the driving forces in thinking about how to fix it.</p> \n<p>In the 1930s, John Maynard Keynes argued that the Great Depression proved that economies aren't governed by powerful forces of equilibrium. The slump went on and on with no sign of self-correction until countries delivered massive jolts in the form of abandoning the gold standard and arming to fight World War II.</p> \n<p>After World War II, however, mainstream economics — such as ""New Keynesian"" economics — developed a different view on the matter, influenced by sophisticated equilibrium-based mathematical models. These approaches see recessions as temporary short-term deviations from the underlying trend. On this view, a downturn that lasts as long as Europe's must simply imply that the prosperity of the mid-aughts was all an illusion. And that means that only biting ""structural reforms"" can improve things by forcing people to adjust to a new, poorer reality with lower wages.</p> \n<p>Yet some economists don't buy this newer view.</p> \n<p>And Varoufakis thinks his video-game research provides empirical reason to doubt it. Actual economies don't have a natural tendency toward equilibrium, and the fact that Europe's slump is really deep and long-lasting simply proves that Europe is in a really deep and long-lasting slump. But it's not, in his view, something Europeans need to suffer through. It reflects blunders made by leaders at the top — blunders that could conceivably be reversed.</p>",Business & Finance

The 21 most-watched television programs in American history are all Super Bowls, and the 2015 Super Bowl is expected to make the list as well. This exposure comes at a price, <a href=""http://www.adweek.com/news/television/nbc-has-sold-95-super-bowl-ads-and-says-45-million-30-steal-162210"">$4.5 million for a 30-second spot</a>, which naturally leads to the question: is it worth it?</p> \n<p>The answer, this year, may be no.</p> \n<h3>Pay per viewer</h3> \n<p>The easiest way to look at this question is to start with industry-wide CPM statistics. That stands for cost per <i>mille, </i>the price an advertiser pays to reach a thousand viewers (advertisers love Latin, apparently). The average CPM for 2015 so far is $37.35 which makes a $4.5 million Super Bowl ad worth the cost if it gets 120.5 million viewers.</p> \n<p>How plausible is that? Well, last year's Super Bowl <a href=""http://www.cbsnews.com/news/super-bowl-2014-ratings-set-new-record/"">secured 111.5 million US viewers</a> which was up from 108.6 million the previous year.</p> \n<p>An increase of 9 million isn't inconceivable. The population is growing, the matchup is arguably a bit more historic (Seattle is going for a rare repeat championship, New England is aiming to cement its legacy as the dominant franchise of our era) and the game is expected to be very close. But it is certainly an aggressive viewership target that would require a spectacular level of growth over and above the Super Bowl's already spectacular viewership level.</p> \n<h3>From bargain to premium</h3> \n<p>As this great chart published last year by Eric Chemi in Bloomberg shows, the price of Super Bowl ads has been growing much faster than Super Bowl viewership:</p> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3351778/superbowl4.0.0.png"" alt=""superbowl4.0.0.png"" data-chorus-asset-id=""3351778""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">(<a href=""http://www.bloomberg.com/bw/articles/2014-01-20/super-bowl-ad-insanity-explained-in-six-charts"">Bloomberg</a>)</p> \n<p>This means that the Super Bowls ads of yore, though extremely expensive in absolute terms, were probably bargains as means of reaching a large audience. Many companies, perhaps, simply weren't willing to pony up the enormous sums involved — creating an opportunity for a handful of mega-brands to buy viewers in bulk. But nothing lasts forever, and the continued pace of appreciation has now created a situation where Super Bowl advertisers are now paying a <i>premium in CPM terms. </i></p> \n<h3>The Super Bowl of marketing opportunities</h3> \n<p>Of course this doesn't prove that a Super Bowl ad is a bad idea. Even if it's not the most cost-effective way to reach 100+ million Americans, it's the only way to reach a population of that size <i>simultaneously. </i></p> \n<p>It's that super-sized one-shot audience that's long made the Super Bowl a great platform for rolling out brand new products or marketing campaigns. There's something unique about seeing something for the first time, and the Super Bowl maximizes the number of people who'll do that all at once. Brands inclined to pay a premium for the Super Bowl opportunity can no doubt talk themselves into the view that the unique nature of the event makes it worthwhile.</p> \n<p>Whether this is really true or not is hard to say. What is clear, however, is that <a href=""http://web.stanford.edu/~rehall/Ads042314.pdf"">advertising spending is pro-cyclical</a>. In other words, when the economy grows ad spending grows even faster. During recessions when the economy shrinks, ad spending shrinks even faster. This winter, we're enjoying stronger economic growth than we've seen in years, so it's no surprise that companies are willing to get more aggressive with their ad dollars. If growth keeps up through 2015, we should expect ads at next year's Super Bowl ads to sell for an even more eye-popping figure than this year's $4.5 million.</p>",Business & Finance

Republicans are offering a deal on net neutrality. Democrats should take it seriously.,http://www.vox.com/2015/2/2/7963243/net-neutrality-bipartisan-compromise,Democrats are making a mistake by dismissing Republican overtures.,"<p>The Federal Communications Commission is on the verge of releasing new, stronger network neutrality regulations. These rules are controversial because they are expected to declare residential internet access a public utility, which could open the door to more regulation of the internet in the future. To forestall that possibility, senior Republicans are <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/1/21/7867869/net-neutrality-republican-compromise"">working on compromise legislation</a> that would establish network neutrality rules <em>without</em> taking the controversial public-utility step.</p> \n<p>But  conversations with insiders suggests that this Republican alternative is probably doomed. Democrats and liberal activists <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2015/01/21/house-democrats-are-itching-for-a-fight-over-net-neutrality/"">think they can get what they want</a> without new legislation. Meanwhile, the Republicans who favor compromise face pressure from purists who oppose any legislation that would impose network neutrality regulations on the internet.</p> \n<p>That's a shame. The internet deserves a more certain resolution to the net neutrality fight than Washington is giving it.</p> \n<p><q class=""right"" aria-hidden=""true""><span>The current situation gives network neutrality supporters unique leverage</span></q></p> \n<p>The network neutrality fight has been raging for more than a decade because current law, passed in 1996, is unclear about how the FCC should regulate the internet. At the time, the internet was a new technology and Congress was primarily focused on older telephone networks. So they wrote vague rules that effectively give the FCC broad latitude to figure out how to regulate internet access.</p> \n<p>If FCC chairman Tom Wheeler establishes strong network neutrality rules in the coming weeks, as he is expected to do, these rules may not live much longer than Barack Obama's presidency. If a Republican is elected to the White House in 2016, it's a near-certainty that the new president will appoint a more conservative FCC chairman who will consider reversing many of Wheeler's reforms.</p> \n<p>That's a problem because the whole point of network neutrality regulations is to create a predictable environment for online content producers. Network neutrality rules that could expire in 2017 won't give internet content providers the same kind of confidence that permanent rules could provide.</p> \n<p>And a situation where the rules change every few years isn't great from the perspective of network neutrality skeptics, either. The public utility rules the FCC is expected to invoke give the agency fairly broad discretion. The next time a liberal takes the White House, she could appoint an FCC chair who imposes even stronger regulations. That kind of uncertainty could discourage investments in broadband.</p> \n<p>A legislative compromise would leave both sides unsatisfied, but it would also provide some certainty about how the internet will be regulated in the future. That would give content companies and network providers alike the confidence to invest, knowing that their plans won't be disrupted by another change in the rules.</p> \n<p>Network neutrality advocates have told me they prefer to have the FCC establish strong regulations first, and negotiate with Republicans after that. But the current situation, with the FCC on the verge of a major regulatory shift, gives network neutrality supporters unique leverage. Republican leaders — and their influential cable and telephone company allies — are highly motivated to cut a deal and preempt reclassification. <span>But once the FCC reclassifies, that sense of urgency will be lost.</span></p>",Business & Finance
American companies are investing way less in science than they used to,http://www.vox.com/2015/2/4/7965967/corporate-research-basic-science,The days of AT&T's Bell Labs inventing the transistor are over. And that could be a big problem for innovation.,"<p>For much of the 20th century, many large US firms ran their own research labs. The idea was that they would conduct wide-ranging scientific research that, eventually, might lead to new products and technologies.</p> \n<p>Those labs often made huge contributions to science. AT&amp;T's Bell Labs racked up <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_Labs"" target=""_blank"">eight Nobel Prizes</a> for inventions like the transistor or the discovery of cosmic background radiation. IBM's Zurich Research Laboratory was renowned for its work on superconductors. Xerox's PARC created a graphical user interface that later inspired the Macintosh<span>.

Nowadays, as <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.nber.org/papers/w20902"">a new NBER paper</a> details, large US companies are focusing more of their R&amp;D efforts on the later stages of development, rather than on basic research:</p> \n<h3>US firms are focusing less on basic and applied research</h3> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3367930/corporate_R_D.0.png"" alt=""corporate_R_D.0.png"" data-chorus-asset-id=""3367930""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">National Science Foundation/Division of Science Resources Statistics, Survey of Industrial Research and Development: 2007. (Arora et al 2015)</p> \n<p>The NBER paper, by Ashish Arora, Sharon Belenzon, and Andrea Patacconi, documents a shift away from scientific research by large companies since the 1980s. It's a trend that could have big implications for the future of innovation and economic growth — especially since the US government <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/02/26/the-coming-rd-crash/"">has <i>also</i> been cutting back</a> on R&amp;D in recent years.</p> \n<p>""There's been anecdotal evidence that scientific research at large companies was on the decline,"" says Arora, a professor at Duke University's Fuqua School of Business. ""You see all these stories about the closing of the research labs. But we wanted to see if it was systematic.""</p> \n<p><q class=""right"" aria-hidden=""true"">Company scientists are publishing fewer papers than they once did</q></p> \n<p>The authors first looked at private-sector R&amp;D and found that it has held steady in recent decades. But the fraction devoted to basic or applied research has been shrinking (<i>see chart</i>). In other words, companies are still investing as much as ever in developing new products and harnessing existing research. They're just investing less in producing the basic science that's often considered the core of innovation.</p> \n<p>The NBER authors found, for example, that scientists at large companies are publishing fewer papers in peer-reviewed journals than they did a few decades ago. (Notably, the drop is largest in basic science, suggesting that this doesn't just reflect firms being more secretive about their applied research.)</p> \n<p>The authors also studied acquisitions. It's possible that large firms are simply ""outsourcing"" basic research to smaller start-ups that then get bought up. The 1980 <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayh%E2%80%93Dole_Act"">Bayh-Dole Act</a> made it easier for universities to license and commercialize their research — and for scientists to start their own smaller companies. So maybe it's just a shift in <i>which </i>companies are doing the science.</p> \n<p>But even when you factor in acquisitions, the authors found that corporate investment in basic research and scientific capacity still seems to be declining. <span>The trend appears to be real. So what's behind it? And is it worth worrying about?</span></p> \n<h3>Why are companies investing less in science?</h3> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3370870/107410047.0.jpg"" alt=""107410047.0.jpg"" data-chorus-asset-id=""3370870""></p> \n<p class=""caption"" style=""text-align: start;"">The Telstar Communications Satellite is Tested In The Laboratory Of Bell Telephones, circa 1962 (Keystone-France/Getty Images)</p> \n<p>One possibility is that companies no longer find science quite as valuable as did 30 years ago. If today's companies are focused more on writing software programs and less on inventing new airplanes (say), then maybe they just have less of a need for basic research programs.</p> \n<p>The authors of the NBER paper can't rule this explanation out, though they're skeptical. They note that companies in the US and Europe are still patenting lots of things. And those patents still rely heavily on cutting-edge scientific research. It's just that companies are doing less of that research themselves.</p> \n<p>As the authors put it: ""Large firms appear to value the golden eggs of science (as reflected in patents) but not the golden goose itself (the scientific capabilities).""</p> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""3370016"" alt=""Screen_Shot_2015-02-03_at_11.18.24_AM.0.png"" src=""https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3370016/Screen_Shot_2015-02-03_at_11.18.24_AM.0.png""></p> \n<p class=""caption"" style=""text-align: start;"">Note: This figure combines internal and acquired publications and patents.

The companies of old with big corporate labs were often highly diversified — like GE or DuPont — and sold a wide variety of products. It made some sense for these companies to invest broadly in basic science that could have all sorts of unforeseen applications. ""<span>In the glory days of DuPont,"" Arora says, ""if you did high-pressure chemistry, that might be useful for fertilizers, or it might be useful for nylon.""</span></p> \n<p>But US companies have become more specialized and narrower in scope since the 1980s, the NBER authors observe. And as that happens, <span>it becomes less economically rational to invest in basic research that might mostly benefit others. Firms that are narrower in scope, the authors find, tend to publish less in scientific journals.</span></p> \n<p>The authors also suggest that globalization may be playing a role: companies in sectors with a higher percentage of Chinese imports have seen the biggest drop in investment in basic research. Possibly competition from China reduces the amount of money a company can devote to science. (It was easier for companies with less external competition, like AT&amp;T or IBM in the 1950s and 1960s, to pour money into basic research that may or may not pay off.)</p> \n<h3>Can other sources of research pick up the slack?</h3> \n<p>So how big a problem is this? That's the big question. The optimistic case is that much of that old corporate research was inefficient, and it's actually a <i>good</i> thing that firms are focusing more heavily on commercializing products while leaving the basic research to universities and government funding.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""right"">'Unless public funding can make up the deficit, technical progress will slacken'</q></p> \n<p>The pessimistic take is that all that corporate-funded research in the 20th century was hugely beneficial, and it will be missed. Here's how the authors put it: ""Established companies can no longer emulate firms such as DuPont, AT&amp;T, or Merck, whose investments in research in the past have significantly advanced the frontiers of human knowledge. <span>Unless public funding can make up the deficit, technical progress will slacken and eventually reduce productivity growth.""</span></p> \n<p>If this pessimistic story is right, that could be a problem. Because another big source of money for scientific research in the United States — the federal government — is also stagnating. Federal funding for basic and applied research grew in the 1980s and 1990s, but <a href=""http://www.aaas.org/page/historical-trends-federal-rd"" target=""_blank"">that growth has stopped</a>, and it's <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/02/26/the-coming-rd-crash/"">set to decline</a> in the years ahead due to budget caps:</p> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""3373644"" alt=""TotRes_0.0.jpg"" src=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3373644/TotRes_0.0.jpg""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">The charts show <a href=""http://www.aaas.org/sites/default/files/BasicRes_0.jpg"" target=""_blank"">basic</a> and <a href=""http://www.aaas.org/sites/default/files/AppliedRes_0.jpg"" target=""_blank"">applied</a> research by agency.

When combined with the decline in corporate-funded science, it points to a potential stagnation in US basic research.</p> \n<p>Some of the experts I talked to for that earlier piece offered a few different ways to look at this.

Given the long-term decline in private sector union membership, this actually doesn't tell us much about what <em>newly organized</em> companies would be like.</p> \n<p>What Frandsen did was specifically look at the outcomes of close unionization elections. That let him compare, not union companies to non-union ones, but companies that unionized to companies whose workforces had similar attitudes toward unionization but didn't quite get over the line. It's a look, in other words, not at the characteristics of union membership — which is often a long legacy — but of the characteristics of <em>unionization</em>.</p> \n<h3>The bad news</h3> \n<p>He found three big things:</p> \n<ol> \n<li>Recently unionized firms employ fewer people</li> \n<li>Recently unionized firms pay lower average wages</li> \n<li>Recently unionized firms are more likely to go out of business</li> \n</ol> \n<p>The idea that a successful unionization drive would reduce wages and salaries seems paradoxical. Delve deeper into the numbers and the solution emerges. It's not that unionization leads to wage cuts. It's that unionization leads to a change in the composition of the workforce. Older and better-paid staff are disproportionately likely to leave a newly unionized shop, which brings average pay levels down even without anyone actually having their wages cut.</p> \n<p>This is because one of the things research constantly finds is that labor unions <a href=""https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=unions+compress+wage+distribution"">reduce wage inequality</a> by raising the floor and lowering the ceiling of pay scales at unionized firms.</p> \n<p>Limiting the pay of the highest-earning members of a particular company in the context of a marketplace where most companies aren't unionized naturally has the effect of inspiring many of those higher-earning workers to seek new jobs elsewhere. This plausibly also explains the finding that recently unionized companies are more likely to go out of business. If you lose your star performers to the competition, you put your business at risk.</p> \n<h3>You can't get there from here</h3> \n<p>Frandsen's findings don't in any way undermine the conclusion that there are viable economic models built around strong private-sector labor unions — look at Germany or the Nordic countries. But they do raise doubts about the idea that there's any feasible path whereby a series of incremental changes could move the United States off its current path of low and shrinking levels of private sector unionization.</p> \n<p>In the context of a workforce with very low union density, unionization at one particular company doesn't actually give workers much bargaining power. But it does create significant competitive disadvantages. The exact opposite is true of a system in which unionization is <em>widespread</em> — in that case there is no competitiveness disadvantage, but workers have more clout systematically.</p> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""3369782"" alt=""Screen_Shot_2015-02-01_at_9.28.24_AM.0.0.png"" src=""https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3369782/Screen_Shot_2015-02-01_at_9.28.24_AM.0.0.png""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">(Richard Freeman)</p> \n<p>The notion that there may be no clear path from the low-unionization equilibrium to the high-unionization equilibrium is bolstered by leading labor scholar Richard Freeman's famous observation that union growth in the United States was <a href=""http://www.nber.org/papers/w6012"">essentially one giant spurt</a>. The Great Depression and World War II produced a <em>dramatic</em> upward surge in union membership, and at all other times it has trended downward. Frandsen's account of what happens at newly organized workplaces in contemporary America helps explain why that downward trend is overwhelmingly likely to continue, absent some new enormous shock to American society. Given their current level of weakness, unions at<em> newly organized </em>private<em> </em>sector workplaces aren't really able to deliver the goods in terms of higher pay and job stability.</p>",Business & Finance
Why Google's rumored ride-sharing service should terrify Uber and Lyft,http://www.vox.com/2015/2/2/7967459/google-terrify-uber-lyft,Entering the ride-sharing business could be the first step toward dominating the taxi business with self-driving vehicles.,"<p>Google is on the verge of getting into the ride-sharing business, creating a rift with the market leader Uber, Bloomberg <a href=""http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-02-02/exclusive-google-and-uber-are-going-to-war-over-taxis"">reports</a>. Uber and Google have been allies since Google invested $258 million in Uber in 2013 and got a seat on its board of directors. But Bloomberg says David Drummond, the Google executive who holds that Uber board seat, has recently informed Uber of its plans to get into the market itself.</p> \n<p>Bloomberg suggests the move is part of Google's larger plan to build a business around self-driving car technology. That would make a lot of sense.</p> \n<p>A lot of people assume that a self-driving car is a product that customers will buy the way people buy conventional cars today. But Google has never been very good at selling physical products; its strength has always been in the provision of services. And that makes the taxi business the perfect place for Google to introduce its self-driving car technology.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""right""><span>For all the talk about Uber and Lyft being disruptive business, they are themselves ripe for disruption</span></q></p> \n<p>Another advantage of renting self-driving cars instead of selling them is reliability. Manufacturers will face lawsuits every time a self-driving car injures or kills someone, so they'll want to do everything they can to prevent errors. And this will be easier to do if manufacturers, not customers, own the vehicles. The last thing Google wants is for a car to crash because its owner forgot to bring it in to replace a key sensor. If Google owns all of the cars running its software, it can ensure that software is upgraded promptly and defective hardware is swapped out immediately.</p> \n<p>Another reason to start in the taxi business is that, for all the talk about Uber and Lyft being disruptive business, they are themselves ripe for disruption. When you take an Uber ride, the majority of the fare goes to pay your driver. With no driver, Google should be able to charge dramatically less than Uber and still make a profit. That big price advantage won't exist if Google tries to sell cars to consumers directly.</p> \n<p>To capture the taxi market, Google needs an Uber-style ride-sharing service to pair with its self-driving technology. It could try to acquire Uber or Lyft, but these companies are now worth billions of dollars.</p> \n<p>So, according to Bloomberg, Google is going to build its own service. This would be an uphill struggle if Google were just trying to create another conventional ride-sharing business, since Uber and Lyft have a huge head start. Ride-sharing services are hugely dependent on what economists call network effects: the more drivers you have, the more attractive the service will be to passengers, and vice versa. Google will be starting with zero drivers and zero passengers, putting it at a big disadvantage.</p> \n<p>Luckily, Google has a lot of money. It can afford to heavily subsidize the service while it develops the software and expertise it needs to connect customers with rides. Then, once the self-driving technology is ready to go, it can beat Uber and Lyft with much lower prices.</p> \n<p><b>Disclosure</b><span>: My </span><a href=""https://twitter.com/startupandrew"">brother</a><span> is an </span><a href=""https://www.firebase.com/blog/2014-10-21-firebase-joins-google.html"" target=""_blank"">executive</a><span> at Google.</span></p>",Business & Finance

How to pick a mutual fund without getting ripped off,http://www.vox.com/2015/2/6/7983147/mutual-fund-rip-off,The most expensive mutual funds charge 20 times as much as the cheapest ones. It's not worth the extra money.,"<p>If you have a white-collar job, there's a good chance your employer offers you a 401(k) retirement plan. Participating is usually a good idea — especially if your employer offers to match your contributions.</p> \n<p>But there's also a good chance you're getting ripped off. The most expensive mutual funds charge more than 20 times as much as the most affordable ones. And the evidence suggests that they're not worth the money. In fact, choosing an expensive plan can cost you tens of thousands of dollars in lost earnings over the course of your career.</p> \n<p>So here's what you should do to avoid getting ripped off by mutual fund companies:</p> \n<ul> \n<li>Put money into a 401(k), especially if there's an employer match</li> \n<li>For most investors, choosing a ""target retirement"" fund from Vanguard or State Street is a good idea. If those are not available, Fidelity's Spartan funds are another good choice.</li> \n<li>If your employer doesn't offer any low-cost mutual funds and doesn't match your contributions, consider an individual retirement account (IRA) as an alternative. </li> \n</ul> \n<p>Read on for details about how to get the most out of your retirement savings.</p> \n<h3>Trying to beat the market is a bad strategy</h3> \n<p><img alt=""1200px-jimcramerphoto"" class=""photo"" src=""http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/assets/4777394/1200px-Jimcramerphoto.jpg""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Pay no attention to stock tips from finance gurus like CNBC's Jim Cramer. (<a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/tulanesally/5103136864/"" sl-processed=""1"">Tulane</a>)</p> \n<p><span>A lot of people on Wall Street make a lot of money by convincing ordinary investors that they can provide better-than-average returns. But the reality is that beating the market is really difficult. Most people who promise to do it don't deliver.</span></p> \n<p>Some mutual funds spend a lot of money doing market research to decide which stocks to invest in. In the 1960s, academic researchers started studying whether these funds produced higher returns for their investors. Surprisingly, the answer was no: the average returns for these ""actively managed"" funds wasn't much better than you'd get by choosing stocks with a dart board.</p> \n<p>This research led to the rise of a new type of mutual fund known as an index fund. Rather than trying to beat the market, these passively-managed funds simply buy every stock in an index such as the S&amp;P 500. Index funds allow investors earn the average market return. And because they don't have to hire a bunch of people to do research, they're very cheap to run. As a result, their returns after expenses tend to be higher than those of actively managed funds. A half-century later, studies are still finding that <a href=""http://www.rickferri.com/WhitePaper.pdf"" sl-processed=""1"">passively managed funds consistently overperform actively managed ones</a>, once expenses are taken into account<span>.</span></p> \n<p>So when choosing mutual funds, don't worry about which funds have earned the best returns in the past. Those funds probably just got lucky, and past performance is no guarantee of future results. Every mutual fund publishes an ""expense ratio,"" which is the percentage of your investment that will get eaten up by management expenses each year. Whenever you have a choice between two similar funds, you should pick the one with lower expenses.</p> \n<h3>The best option is a low-cost target retirement fund</h3> \n<p><img alt=""452318646"" class=""photo"" src=""http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/assets/4776970/452318646.jpg""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">(<a href=""http://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/young-chinese-couple-taking-photos-in-hong-kong-with-an-news-photo/452318646"" sl-processed=""1"">Stefan Irvine/LightRocket via Getty Images</a>)</p> \n<p>Which fund should you buy? The best option for a novice investor is a ""target retirement"" fund — but only if it has reasonable expenses.</p> \n<p>A good example is Vanguard's <a href=""https://investor.vanguard.com/mutual-funds/target-retirement/#/"" sl-processed=""1"">Target Retirement</a> funds. You pick the year you want to retire (for example, if you're in your late 20s you'd pick the <a href=""https://investor.vanguard.com/mutual-funds/target-retirement/#/mini/overview/0699"" sl-processed=""1"">Target Retirement 2050</a> plan), and Vanguard automatically allocates your savings to a mix of stocks and bonds that's appropriate for your expected retirement date. It has a modest 0.18 percent expense ratio, meaning that consumers pay just $18 for every $10,000 invested. (<b>Disclosure</b>: I have most of my retirement savings in Vanguard mutual funds, and because Vanguard is structured as a cooperative, that technically makes me a Vanguard shareholder.)</p> \n<p>Last year, State Street Bank began <a href=""http://www.ssgafunds.com/product/fund.seam?ticker=SSDLX"" target=""_blank"">offering low-cost target retirement plans</a> too. With an expense ratio of 0.17 percent — slightly cheaper than Vanguard's — these are another great option.</p> \n<p>But other mutual fund companies' target retirement funds are a lot more expensive. For example, <a href=""https://fundresearch.fidelity.com/mutual-funds/summary/315792416"" target=""_blank"">Fidelity's Freedom 2050</a> fund and <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www3.troweprice.com/fb2/fbkweb/snapshot.do?ticker=TRRMX"">T. Rowe Price's Retirement 2050</a> funds have expense ratios of 0.78 percent and 0.76 percent, respectively. If you invest $10,000 in these funds, you'll lose $70 every year (and more as your money grows). That's a terrible deal.</p> \n<h3>How to build your own portfolio</h3> \n<p>Most investment advisors recommend investing your retirement savings into three types of assets: domestic stocks, international stocks, and bonds. Target retirement accounts do this for you automatically based on your desired retirement date. But if your employer's 401(k) plan doesn't offer you an affordable Target Retirement plan — one that charges 0.20 percent or less — then you might need to do it yourself. This chart can help.</p> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""3378748"" alt=""portfolio.0.png"" src=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3378748/portfolio.0.png""></p> \n<p>For each of these three categories, you'll want to choose the broadest fund with the lowest expense ratio. For example, Fidelity's Spartan Total Market fund, with an expense ratio as low as 0.05 percent, is a good choice for domestic stocks. It invests in more than 3,000 US stocks. Fidelity also has a Spartan International fund (0.12 percent expense ratio) for international stocks and a Spartan U.S. Bond fund (0.10 percent expense ratio) for bonds.</p> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""3378426"" alt=""Screen_Shot_2015-02-05_at_2.12.55_PM.0.png"" src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3378426/Screen_Shot_2015-02-05_at_2.12.55_PM.0.png""></p> \n<p>Unfortunately, many mutual fund companies don't offer low-cost index funds. And mutual fund companies seem to make this process as confusing as possible. In the chart above, I've listed the most affordable funds I could find from each company (the last column is the average cost assuming you invest 60 percent in stocks and 20 percent in the other categories). However, many mutual funds are offered in several different ""classes"" with wildly different fees.</p> \n<p>Take JP Morgan, for example. I've listed the company's Equity Index Fund as having a respectable 0.20 percent expense ratio based on the fund's <a href=""http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/fund/HLEIX"" target=""_blank"">""select""</a> share class. However, JP Morgan also offers another version of the exact same fund, called <a href=""http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/fund/OGEIX"" target=""_blank"">""Class B,""</a> with an insane 1.2 percent expense ratio, 24 times the cost of Vanguard and Fidelity's funds. So if your employer is offering JP Morgan mutual funds, it's important to read the fine print. The ""select"" version of the fund is a pretty good deal. Other versions are not.</p> \n<h3>What to do if your employer doesn't offer any good options</h3> \n<p>It's possible your employer's 401(k) plan won't offer any low-cost funds. In that case, you have a few options:</p> \n<p><b>Skip your employer's 401 and invest in an individual retirement account instead.</b> IRAs offer most of the same tax benefits as a 401(k), but are not tied to an employer. That means you, not your employer, choose which mutual funds company to use. You can sign up for a Vanguard IRA <a href=""https://investor.vanguard.com/ira/vanguard?WT.srch=1"" target=""_blank"">here</a> or a State Street IRA <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.statestreetbank.com/personal/savings/individual-retirement-accounts.html"">here</a>.</p> \n<p>There are two big downsides to this strategy: first, you miss out on any matching contributions your employer might offer, and these will usually be worth more than the extra fees you have to pay.</p> \n<p>Second, the contribution limits are lower for IRAs: currently $5,500 for an IRA versus $18,000 for a 401(k). So if you earn an above-average income, you will probably want to save more than the IRA limit. Still, you can max out your IRA first and then invest any remaining amount in your 401(k).</p> \n<p><b>You can roll your 401(k) contributions into an IRA when you leave your job.</b> High fees add up over the course of a career, but they're not necessarily a big deal if you're only paying them for a year or two. Once you leave your job, you'll be able to transfer the money to an IRA managed by a lower-cost fund.</p> \n<p><span><b>Lobby your HR department to switch to lower-cost options.</b> Your HR department may not realize how many thousands of dollars of employee savings are being wasted by mutual funds that charge too much. While switching retirement plans isn't trivial, it can be done, and your coworkers might thank you for it. Right now, Vanguard offers the broadest range of low-cost funds, but Fidelity and State Street also offer good options.</span></p>",Business & Finance

Super Bowl XLIX seems to have been a bit of an economic bust,http://www.vox.com/2015/2/6/7989091/super-bowl-economic-impact,"Economically speaking, it's better to hold the big game in a cold city.","<p>Mega-events like the Super Bowl are always sold to local communities as offering an enormous economic boost.

We see that while New York saw a substantial acceleration in its Super Bowl year, Phoenix did not — with sales growth actually decelerating compared to where it had been before.</p> \n<p>Of course, that's not nearly enough to prove that the Phoenix Super Bowl was a bust. But the sector-by-sector breakdown is telling:</p> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""3380852"" alt=""Second_Super_Bowl_chart.0.png"" src=""https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3380852/Second_Super_Bowl_chart.0.png""></p> \n<p>The most interesting thing about this chart is what's missing — hotels and leisure. That suggests that the influx of football fans crowded out tourists who would otherwise be coming to Phoenix. In New York, by contrast, hotels are less likely to be full in January, so there really could be a boom. One key difference here is that Phoenix is warm in the winter and New York is not.</p> \n<p><span>The football fans drank more beer, but maybe spent less on other leisure pursuits. Meanwhile, the general retail sector  — everything from furniture to building supplies — was actually down 0.1 percent in Phoenix year-over-year on the Super Bowl weekend, with locals maybe cowering at home in fear of crowds rather than going out and shopping.</span></p> \n<p>It's hard to get conclusive analysis of this sort of thing. But the First Data information is at least highly suggestive that cities should think about the calendar when deciding whether mega-events will have big economic benefits. The supply of hotel rooms doesn't really change whether or not you host a Super Bowl (or an Olympics or a World Cup or a presidential nominating convention). But almost every city has a high season and a low season for visitors. Staging an event during low season can fill rooms that would otherwise be empty, and give your city a boost. Staging an event during a low-occupancy period is more likely to shift spending around than to truly grow it.</p>",Business & Finance
The unemployment rate didn't fall â€” and that's good news,http://www.vox.com/2015/2/6/7991585/january-2015-unemployment-rate,A sign the economy has room to grow,"<p>The jobs report released today was full of good news — 257,000 new jobs added in January. 147,000 new jobs were added by revisions to December and November data. 91,000 new jobs were added by revisions to earlier data. Average hourly wages rose, and the previous month's wage data was revised upward.</p> \n<p>But perhaps the best news of all is something that sounds a little odd — the unemployment rate didn't fall.</p> \n<p>That's because the years-long trend toward a <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/1/29/7938229/obama-economic-plan-chart"" target=""_blank"">falling labor force participation rate</a> turned around. A bunch of new jobs were created, but the ratio of employed people to people looking for work didn't fall since the denominator rose along with the numerator.

The aging piece of this wasn't going to change. If anything, it was only set to accelerate. So that decline in the size of the workforce could potentially have put a ceiling on future economic growth.</p> \n<p>The big question then became, what would happen with the green and blue slices?

And whatever caused the mysterious blue wedge, would it ever go into reverse?</p> \n<p>A stable unemployment rate in the context of job growth and wage growth is a sign of good news about those green and blue wedges. It means that not only have we had some good economic growth news over the past nine months, but that growth is likely <i>sustainable</i> and there's no need to panic about inflation or anything else.

Over dinner one of them told me that he was saddened by the negative stereotypes of Swiss banking secrecy that prevailed in the United States. People, he told me, think of Swiss banks as helping drug smugglers or terrorists launder money. The truth is simpler. ""There are many wealthy people in the world,"" he told me, ""and they prefer not to pay taxes.""</p> \n<p>That is the basic message of a huge trove of documents that were leaked from the British bank HSBC's Swiss arm to journalists from The Guardian, Le Monde, BBC Panorama and the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists.</p> \n<p>You can <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/feb/08/hsbc-files-expose-swiss-bank-clients-dodge-taxes-hide-millions?CMP=share_btn_tw"">dive deep on the Guardian's site</a>, but suffice it to say that while there's no al-Qaeda here there's an <em>awful lot</em> of tax evasion.</p> \n<p>And not just in the sense that foreigners would use Swiss bank accounts to facilitate tax avoidance.

The real point, however, is the one my Swiss banking friend related to me back in the fall of 2008: bankers in Switzerland saw helping rich foreigners evade taxes as part of the job. They didn't think it was wrong, morally or legally, so they did it regularly and almost casually. If people were hiding money to arm ISIS, that might be wrong. But dodging taxes wasn't breaking the rules, <em>it was the whole job</em>.</p> \n<p>For a quantitative look at this problem, <a href=""http://gabriel-zucman.eu/files/Zucman2014JEP.pdf"">Gabriel Zucman's paper on tax havens</a> is indispensable.

This is the real truth about journalists' pay,http://www.vox.com/2015/2/10/8011467/journalist-salaries,"Reporting pays about an average amount for a job, which is pretty bad for a job that often requires expensive degrees.","<p>Felix Salmon wrote a piece yesterday arguing that the economics of journalism are collapsing and <a href=""http://fusion.net/story/45832/to-all-the-young-journalists-asking-for-advice/"">nobody should become a journalist</a>. But he framed it as ""advice"" to young journalists, which prompted <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/2/9/8008365/advice-to-young-journalists"">various pieces of actual advice to journalists</a>. But what about the issue Salmon raised? Is journalism a profession that denies people ""a good chance at a well-paid middle-class lifestyle down the road?"" A look at the numbers suggests that Salmon is wrong. Journalism today is very much a middle class occupation. And in many ways that's the problem — the middle class is struggling economically these days, and journalists are no exception.</p> \n<p><a href=""http://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm"">According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics</a>, the average hourly wage for non-supervisory workers in the United States was $20.80 in January up slightly from $20.30 in 2013. For <em>all</em> workers, including managers it was $24.75 up form $24.10 in 2013.</p> \n<p>Now for journalists we learn from the BLS that back in 2013, <a href=""http://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes273022.htm"">reporters earned $21.33 on average</a> and <a href=""http://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes273041.htm"">editors brought in $30.20</a>.</p> \n<p>In terms of pay, in other words, it looks like journalism is a basically average job.</p> \n<p>Some of the perception among journalists that journalism is a poorly paying occupation probably comes from the fact that journalists generally have educational qualifications that are considerably above average.<strong> </strong>You rarely meet a journalist who doesn't have a bachelor's degree and you frequently meet journalists who have master's degrees. So journalists may feel underpaid compared to their peers even without being objectively impoverished. On the other hand, writing articles is a lot more entertaining than writing appellate briefs or whatever and this tends to drive down pay in the sector.</p> \n<p>A related issue is that journalism jobs tend to be heavily concentrated in areas with expensive housing. That $21.33 an hour would go a lot further in St. Louis than in Brooklyn, but you're more likely to need to live in the New York area to work than you would if you were, say, a teacher. The good news is that there's not much evidence that things are especially getting <em>worse</em> for journalism. A <a href=""http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/08/11/the-growing-pay-gap-between-journalism-and-public-relations/"">Pew Center report</a>, showing that the pay gap between PR professionals and journalists is widening, got a lot of attention in media circles last year. But the chart didn't show that journalists' compensation was <em>falling</em>, just that it was rising more slowly than PR pay.</p> \n<p>But the bottom line here is that it doesn't seem remotely true that a journalist can't expect a middle class living. The problem is that journalists, like many middle class Americans who aren't journalists, are suffering from the out-of-control cost structure of college and urban housing in the United States. You could transcend these problems by becoming a multi-millionaire CEO or hedge fund manager, of course. But there, again, the problem isn't that journalism isn't a middle class job but that it <em>is</em> a middle class job at a time when the economy seems to only work for the top one percent.</p>",Business & Finance
The simple economic principle that can help you get a better deal at hotels,http://www.vox.com/2015/2/11/8015699/hotel-booking-tips,It's all about fixed costs versus variable costs.,"<p>Everyone likes a good bargain. And when it comes to booking a hotel, understanding a single basic principle can help you find one. The key is the idea of <em>high fixed costs</em> and <em>low variable costs</em>. What that means is that building a hotel is very expensive, (fixed cost) but cleaning a hotel room is cheap (variable costs). This creates some dilemmas for hotel operators in terms of pricing strategy: Set the nightly room fee low enough that your hotel sells out, for example, and you're almost certainly leaving some profits on the table.</p> \n<p>But raise rates in order to maximize profits, and you're leaving some rooms empty. Yet with the variable cost of leasing out an extra room so low, it doesn't really make sense to leave the room empty. What you want to do is sell most of your rooms at one high price, and then sell the leftover rooms at another lower price. Conversely you, the customer, want to do exactly the opposite and book yourself the cheap leftover rooms. How do you pull that off? Well there are three basic tricks, in order of severity:</p> \n<ul> \n<li>Search as widely as possible</li> \n<li>Check and check again</li> \n<li>Shop blind</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Need more detail? Read on.</p> \n<h3>Metasearching</h3> \n<p>One way to find a hotel near your destination is to look on the map for one, and then visit that hotel's website. Or you could log on to your favorite chain's website and start searching. Those are great ways to find hotels if you're finicky or attached to a particular brand. And signaling that you are picky is a great way to get yourself slotted into the expensive rooms bucket.</p> \n<p>But if you want a good deal, you need to do the opposite of that. Use a meta-search engine like <a href=""http://www.kayak.com/"">Kayak</a> or <a href=""http://www.trivago.com/"">Trivago</a> that searches across multiple travel search engines.</p> \n<p>Not only does this maximize your odds of finding a great rate, it indicates that you are the person who is looking to be stingy. Hotels with extra rooms to unload want to unload them specifically to stingy people, so as to preserve their power to charge higher rates to the less-thrifty. Act like a stingy person, and you'll get a stingy person's offer.</p> \n<h3>Check and check again</h3> \n<p>You usually make travel plans in advance, right? Well good for you. But just because you've already booked your room doesn't mean the rest of the world has ground to a halt. Keep checking back to see if the passage of time has freed up rooms at a better rate.</p> \n<p>There's no way to predict the optimal time to book a room for a great price. What you need to realize, however, is that for any given trip, there is <em>some</em> optimal time and the odds that the <em>particular</em> time you happened to pick was the optimal time are very low. Keep checking! If a better rate presents itself, book it and then cancel your old reservation.</p> \n<p>Of course this doesn't work if you book yourself a prepaid room, or one that comes with hefty cancellation fees. (Normally giving up that flexibility gets you a discount.) The point is that either way, you want to make flexibility work for you. Either book a flexible room and then keep checking, or else score a discount by abandoning flexibility. But under no circumstances should you book a flexible rate and then just forget about it unless emergency strikes. Search, search, search, and search again.</p> \n<h3>Shop blind</h3> \n<p>The most formalized method of price discrimination hotels use these days is listing rooms on sites like Hotwire or Priceline. The trick is that with these sites you need to commit to booking a room without being told which hotel you're booking at. You just get information about the neighborhood, the general fanciness level of the hotel, and what amenities it offers. But the name and exact address are secret.</p> \n<p>What kind of a person would agree to book a hotel blindly?</p> \n<p>Well, a person who really wants a bargain. And that's the name of the whole hotel game — the bargains go to the people who are credibly committed to bargain shopping. A hotel can release some cheap rooms to blind shopping while simultaneously listing them at a higher prices through more conventional channels.</p>",Business & Finance
Brian Williams suspended for 6 months without pay,http://www.vox.com/2015/2/10/8016551/brian-williams-suspended,"Misstatements about a helicopter incident in Iraq bring down America's #1 news anchor.","<ol> \n<li><span>NBC News is suspending anchor Brian Williams for 6 months with no pay (full statement below).</span></li> \n<li><span>Williams has <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/2/5/7987439/brian-williams-iraq-apology-helicopter"" target=""_blank"">repeatedly misstated the events</a> surrounding a helicopter trip he took in Iraq.</span></li> \n<li><span>Williams apologized for his misstatements, but the controversy brought to light other episodes of Williams statements that appear to have been untrue. </span></li> \n<li><span>Lester Holt will fill in for Williams on at least a temporary basis.</span></li> \n<li><span>Williams signed a 5-year, $10 million contract extension in December so NBC had no long-term Williams replacement plan in place.</span></li> \n</ol> \n<h3>What happened to Brian Williams in Iraq</h3> \n<p>In 2003, Williams was in Iraq to cover the US invasion. He and his camera crew were riding in a Chinook helicopter across the desert. Another group of three Chinooks were flying in formation about an hour ahead of them, and one of those helicopters was hit by an RPG and forced down. The other two Chinooks in the formation also made emergency landings. When Williams' helicopter caught up with the others, it landed as well.</p> \n<p>It is not clear whether Williams' Chinook landed because the others had already made emergency landings, or because a sandstorm was rolling in. However, the sandstorm did arrive, which meant that all four helicopters, their pilots and crews, and the NBC News staffers were all stuck in the desert for several days.</p> \n<p>But the main thing to know here is that everyone — including Brian Williams — agrees that his helicopter did not get hit by enemy fire. That did not happen.</p> \n<h3>Williams told a false story several times</h3> \n<p>But Williams has said that his helicopter was hit by enemy fire — on several occasions.</p> \n<p>During his tribute speech on January 30, Williams said, ""The story actually started with a terrible moment a dozen years back during the invasion of Iraq when the helicopter we were traveling in was forced down after being hit by an RPG.""</p> \n<p>He went on to claim, ""Our traveling NBC News team was rescued, surrounded and kept alive by an armor mechanized platoon from the US Army 3rd Infantry.""</p> \n<p>During a March 2013 appearance on David Letterman, Williams said that ""two of our four helicopters were hit by ground-fire, including the one I was in, RPG and AK-47.""</p> \n<p>A few weeks earlier, Williams had told a similar tale during an appearance on Alec Baldwin's WNYC podcast ""Here's the Thing."" Williams said that his ""unbridled confidence"" occasionally got him into trouble. ""I've done some ridiculously stupid things under that banner, like being in a helicopter I had no business being in in Iraq, with rounds coming into the airframe."" Baldwin asked Williams if he had thought he was going to die, and he replied ""Briefly. Sure.""</p> \n<h3>Williams' fall is costly for NBC</h3> \n<blockquote lang=""en"" class=""twitter-tweet""> \n<p>Reactions from NBCers: ""I am gobsmacked."" ""No guarantee of coming back.""

NBC's morning show ""Today,"" the longtime leader in its time slot, had slipped in recent years. The once dominant NBC News Sunday show ""Meet The Press"" fell so severely in the ratings that its anchor David Gregory got fired. <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://newsbusters.org/blogs/randy-hall/2014/12/30/cnn-ends-2014-all-time-low-ratings-msnbc-falls-third-place-among-news"">MSNBC's ratings have also slipped</a>,  and in 2014 CNBC had its worst ratings year since the mid-1990s.</p> \n<p>By contrast, Williams hosted what was normally the top-rated prime time newscast.</p> \n<h3>NBC News' full statement on Williams' suspension</h3> \n<blockquote> \n<p>All,</p> \n<p>We have decided today to suspend Brian Williams as Managing Editor and Anchor of NBC Nightly News for six months. The suspension will be without pay and is effective immediately.  We let Brian know of our decision earlier today. Lester Holt will continue to substitute Anchor the NBC Nightly News.</p> \n<p>Our review, which is being led by Richard Esposito working closely with NBCUniversal General Counsel Kim Harris, is ongoing, but I think it is important to take you through our thought process in coming to this decision.</p> \n<p>While on Nightly News on Friday, January 30, 2015, Brian misrepresented events which occurred while he was covering the Iraq War in 2003. It then became clear that on other occasions Brian had done the same while telling that story in other venues. This was wrong and completely inappropriate for someone in Brian's position.</p> \n<p>In addition, we have concerns about comments that occurred outside NBC News while Brian was talking about his experiences in the field.</p> \n<p>As Managing Editor and Anchor of Nightly News, Brian has a responsibility to be truthful and to uphold the high standards of the news division at all times.</p> \n<p>Steve Burke, Pat Fili and I came to this decision together. We felt it would have been wrong to disregard the good work Brian has done and the special relationship he has forged with our viewers over 22 years.  Millions of Americans have turned to him every day, and he has been an important and well-respected part of our organization.</p> \n<p>As I'm sure you understand, this was a very hard decision. Certainly there will be those who disagree.  But we believe this suspension is the appropriate and proportionate action.</p> \n<p>This has been a difficult time. But NBC News is bigger than this moment. You work so hard and dedicate yourselves each and every day to the important work of bringing trusted, credible news to our audience. Because of you, your loyalty, your dedication, NBC News is an organization we can - and should - all be proud of. We will get through this together.</p> \n<p>Steve Burke asked me to share the following message.</p> \n<p>""This has been a painful period for all concerned and we appreciate your patience while we gathered the available facts. By his actions, Brian has jeopardized the trust millions of Americans place in NBC News. His actions are inexcusable and this suspension is severe and appropriate. Brian's life's work is delivering the news. I know Brian loves his country, NBC News and his colleagues. He deserves a second chance and we are rooting for him. Brian has shared his deep remorse with me and he is committed to winning back everyone's trust.""</p> \n<p>Deborah</p> \n<br>\n</blockquote>",Business & Finance
13 ways of looking at a clickbait,http://www.vox.com/2015/2/13/8033937/clickbait-explained,What we talk about when we talk about clickbait,"<p>1. One of the concerns we hear at Vox.com is that there is too much clickbait on the internet — and on our site — these days. So I thought it would be useful to say a few words about how Vox thinks about what clickbait is, and what it isn't.</p> \n<p>2. When we talk about clickbait internally, we tend to focus on the idea of under-delivering on a misleading headline. The risk that a reader will feel she has been duped into clicking.</p> \n<p>3. Others often seem to be using ""clickbait"" as a free-floating term of derision. There are many reasons one might dislike an article but calling it clickbait has become an all-purpose way of expressing that disapproval.</p> \n<p>4. The fact is we are trying to write headlines that make you want to click. We want you to click and read (ideally share on Facebook, Twitter, email, or the social network of your choice) the articles we publish! What we don't want is for you to regret having clicked once you see what is behind the link.</p> \n<p>5. Getting people to read (much less share!) wasn't always the point of headlines. Newspapers are built to be scanned, not read, and feature summary-style headlines intended to work as an <em>alternative</em> to reading the articles. That's tied to the newspaper's business model. Most web publishers have a business model that only works if readers click, and lately, if they share.</p> \n<p>6. You'll be less disappointed that websites don't operate exactly like newspapers if you remind yourself that <em>lots</em> of things — magazines and books, for instance — also don't operate like newspapers.</p> \n<p>7. Because Google and OS-level widgets now dominate the commodity information services (weather, sports scores, stock quotes, movie showtimes, tv listings) that used to sell newspaper subscriptions, all websites are more like ultra-high-frequency magazines than like newspapers.</p> \n<p>8. Magazines, which were traditionally bought off of newsstands packed with other magazines, are really good at choosing appealing headlines and striking images, and promising content the reader will enjoy reading. Lists weren't invented by Buzzfeed — they're all over the cover of every magazine.</p> \n<p>9. More broadly, human beings have been making ideas more digestible by organizing them into lists since at least the time Moses brought the <a href=""http://lifehopeandtruth.com/bible/10-commandments/the-ten-commandments/10-commandments-list/"">10 Commandments</a> down from the mountain.</p> \n<p>10. A problem any general news site faces is that a broad audience means people with very different tastes. One person's clickbait can be another's favorite article.</p> \n<p>11.  A publication that only ran stories that appeal to everyone would end up being extraordinarily shallow and, paradoxically, full of ""clickbait.""</p> \n<p>12. This is true even at the most premium of publications. Every New Yorker subscriber in America has a pile of unread issues lying around the house, awaiting sporadic cleanup. People subscribe for the sake of the great articles that they <em>do</em> read, not for the issues they never got around to opening or for the pages they scanned and decided to skip.</p> \n<p>13. The dream of every tech-savvy publisher in America is to develop algorithmic distribution tools that will know who you are and what you will like, ensuring that you are served all and only headlines and articles that you find both clicky and pleasing to click on. Thus the scourge of ""clickbait"" will someday be eliminated from the earth.</p>",Business & Finance
"Chocolate prices are soaring, so candy makers are making their bars smaller",http://www.vox.com/2015/2/14/8038451/chocolate-prices-economics,"Here's what's sending cocoa prices spiking, and how you'll see it when you buy a chocolate bar","<p>On <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/02/13/chocolate-shortage_n_1273795.html"">Valentine's Day 2012</a>, we learned that the world was in a chocolate crisis.

And how is it changing the box of chocolates you're giving your beloved this year? Here's the rundown.</p> \n<p><strong>Huge demand in Asia:</strong> Rapidly growing economies mean huge populations of consumers ready to spend their growing incomes on new tastes. China is a prime example of this for a variety of foods — dairy and meat, for example, in addition to chocolate. But Indonesia and India are also big growth markets for chocolate. Per capita chocolate consumption in China grew by 30 percent from 2010 to 2013, according to data from market research firm Mintel, and it grew by 34 and 38 percent respectively in India and Indonesia over that period. But consumption grew nowhere as much as in South Korea, where it was up a whopping 44 percent.</p> \n<p><strong>Dark chocolate is super popular:</strong> It's true that milk chocolate still dominates the chocolate market in the US. As of 2013, dark chocolate only accounted for around 20 percent of US chocolate sales, according to the <a href=""http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303983904579091120112729130"">Wall Street Journal</a>. But dark chocolate is gaining ground fast. According to Mintel's data, dark chocolate sales in the US grew by 9 percent in 2013, 50 percent faster than milk chocolate's growth of just 6 percent.</p> \n<p>Because dark chocolate uses so much more cocoa than milk, it sucks up that much more of the world's cocoa crop. Hershey milk chocolate bars, for example, have, at most, 30 percent cacao, according to the <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/13/dining/13chocolate.html?pagewanted=print"">New York Times</a>, but FDA standards allow for percentages as low as 10 percent. Compare that to the 60-plus-percent cacao content of many dark chocolate bars.</p> \n<p><strong>Drought:</strong> Africa is where most of the world's cocoa is grown. The continent accounts for nearly 72 percent of all world production, according to Mintel's data, most of it in Cote d'Ivoire and Ghana. So when a drought hits that area, as it did <a href=""http://www.accuweather.com/en/weather-news/drought-world-chocolate-shortage/38145875"">last year</a>, it can send prices spiking. This is sort of like what we saw with the lime shortage of 2014 — when a particular commodity is grown in one geographic region, a threat to that region, whether it's cartels or drought, can create huge price shocks.</p> \n<p><strong>Tree diseases:</strong> The diseases attacking cocoa trees have creative names (frosty pod, horsehair blight) but are threatening cocoa supplies, as <a href=""http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2015/01/23/cocoa_research_centre_in_trinidad_hopes_to_solve_global_chocolate_shortage.html"">Slate</a> reported last year. For that reason, scientists are engineering new breeds of cocoa trees, as <a href=""http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-11-14/to-save-chocolate-scientists-develop-new-breeds-of-cacao"">Bloomberg</a> reported last year, but it's a struggle to make that chocolate taste as good as what farmers are growing now.</p> \n<p><b>Ebola:</b> The current ebola outbreak in Africa took place next door to the world's biggest chocolate producers. And even though chocolate producing nations like Ivory Coast, Ghana, and Nigeria weren't the epicenter of the ebola outbreak, closing their borders to workers from ebola-stricken nations helped limit production in recent months, as <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.politico.com/story/2014/10/ebola-chocolate-industry-africa-effects-111809.html"">Politico</a> reported.</p> \n<p>Constrained supply plus growing demand equals higher prices. And shortfalls are only projected to grow. <a href=""http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-11-14/to-save-chocolate-scientists-develop-new-breeds-of-cacao"">Bloomberg</a> reports that the gap between supply and demand is expected to total 1 million metric tons in 2020 and 2 million as of 2030.</p> \n<p>Of course, none of this means store shelves are going to be suddenly devoid of chocolate.</p> \n<p>""The world is not going to run out of cocoa,"" says Judith Ganes, founder of <a href=""https://www.jganesconsulting.com/"">J. Ganes Consulting</a>, which specializes in analysis of ""soft commodities"" like cocoa, coffee, and cotton.</p> \n<p>But customers will see some changes they may not like, she adds. ""Prices will go up if there is a shortfall and manufacturers will change unit sizes or switch to cheaper alternatives or use more cocoa powder than butter or carob.  That will loosen the supply.  Producers won’t sit on stocks.""</p> \n<p>And chocolate companies have responded. Last July, Hershey's announced a price hike on its products due to higher cocoa, milk, and nut prices. Cadbury's recently announced it would change its signature creme eggs, replacing its Dairy Milk chocolate with a more ""standard cocoa mix"" chocolate, as <a href=""http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2015/01/15/cadbury_creme_egg_recipe_change_what_is_dairy_milk_and_why_are_britons_so.html"">Slate</a> reported — a response not only to high chocolate prices but rising<strong> </strong>milk prices as well. And in Australia, the company shrank the size of its chocolate bars <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/feb/03/cadbury-shrinks-chocolate-bars-by-10-but-price-stays-the-same-australia"">by 10 percent</a>. Mars and Snickers in 2013<a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2524032/Mars-Snickers-chocolate-bars-shrink-size-price-stays-same.html""> similarly</a> shrank some of their bars.</p> \n<p>If smaller, lower-quality chocolate bars don't sound like a great fix for this problem, help may be on the way.

Two charts that show one way French socialism works surprisingly well,http://www.vox.com/2015/2/19/8064913/labor-force-participation-france, ,"<p>From a traditional neoliberal viewpoint, France is doing almost everything wrong economically. They've got high taxes, lots of regulation, and a generous welfare state. Heck, they even have state-owned enterprises. Clearly, it must be a wasteland of unemployment and idleness.</p> \n<p>But here's a fun chart from the new Economic Report of the President that says otherwise:</p> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3423254/men.0.png"" alt=""men.0.png"" data-chorus-asset-id=""3423254""></p> \n<p>French men of prime working age — i.e., between the ages of 25 and 54 — are much more likely than American men to be in the labor force. And the gap is growing.</p> \n<p>What's true is that if you look at older French men, they're less likely to work thanks to more generous retirement policies. And if you look at younger French men, they're also less likely to work thanks to more generous student aid policies. America is great at getting kids in college to also work on the side, and it's good at making sure older people can't retire. But in terms of getting men in their prime working years into the labor force? We're not as good as Canada or the United Kingdom and we're way worse than Germany or France.</p> \n<p>The White House's economists don't have any particularly sharp theories as to why this is other than a somewhat hazy notion that European countries have better institutions for connecting people to work.</p> \n<p>So how about women?</p> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3423270/women.0.png"" alt=""women.0.png"" data-chorus-asset-id=""3423270""></p> \n<p>Here you also see France and Germany doing great.

Walmart's big wage bump shows the economy is improving,http://www.vox.com/2015/2/19/8068871/walmart-minimum-wage-pay,"The company is raising its entry-level wage to $9 per hour and will hand out 500,000 raises this year","<ol> \n<li> <span>Walmart </span><a style=""font-size: 1.15em; line-height: 1.65; background-color: #ffffff;"" href=""http://news.walmart.com/news-archive/investors/2015/02/19/walmart-announces-q4-underlying1-eps-of-161-and-additional-strategic-investments-in-people-e-commerce-walmart-us-comp-sales-increased-15-percent"" target=""_blank"">announced Thursday</a><span> that it is bumping its entry-level wage to $9 in April. Current associates will also all be earning a minimum of $10 by February 2016.</span> </li> \n<li><span>The company is framing this as a way of doing the right thing and helping its workers succeed within the company.</span></li> \n<li><span>It's also a clear sign that the economy is improving — the nation's largest private employer is raising wages amid other strong signs of labor market improvement.</span></li> \n</ol> \n<h3>About 500,000 workers will benefit this year</h3> \n<p>Walmart's quarterly earnings, which it announced on Thursday, were <a href=""http://www.marketwatch.com/story/wal-mart-priceline-t-mobile-earnings-in-focus-2015-02-18"" target=""_blank"">unremarkable</a>. But the mammoth retailer also announced that it's raising its entry-level wage to $9 per hour (around $18,700 annually, assuming 40-hour weeks) in April. In addition, by February 1, 2016, current associates will all get a minimum of $10 per hour <span>($20,800 annually)</span><span>. The company is also introducing higher wages for some department managers, bumping their pay from $13 to $15 per hour (or $31,200 in a year, again assuming 40-hour weeks).</span></p> \n<p>The company has said in the past that only around 6,000 of its roughly 1.3 million workers make the federal minimum wage of $7.25. But that's partly because <a href=""http://www.ncsl.org/research/labor-and-employment/state-minimum-wage-chart.aspx"" target=""_blank"">29 states</a> and the District of Columbia have minimum wages above the $7.25 mark. Altogether, many more employees will benefit from this wage hike: the company says around 500,000 workers will benefit from this year's pay raises.</p> \n<p>The company is framing it as a way of showing its employees that they are valued. In a <a href=""http://blog.walmart.com/in-letter-to-associates-walmart-ceo-doug-mcmillon-announces-higher-pay"" target=""_blank"">letter to workers</a>, CEO Doug McMillon said the change in pay policy is one way the company is shifting to do right by its employees.</p> \n<p>""We're always trying to do the right thing and build a stronger business. We frequently get it right but sometimes we don't. When we don't, we adjust,"" MacMillan wrote, pointing to a rough economy and recent changes in how customers shop.</p> \n<h3>Paying higher wages can be good for the bottom line</h3> \n<p>But of course, no company will undertake such a large-scale wage boost out of pure altruism. Raising the pay of lower-wage workers can have sizable benefits for a company, resulting in higher productivity, less absenteeism, and lower employee turnover. The Peterson Institute for International Economics published <a href=""http://blogs.piie.com/realtime/?p=4700"" target=""_blank"">a thorough rundown</a> of the evidence earlier this year, from economists Justin Wolfers and Jan Zilinsky.</p> \n<p>The pay bump also could help boost the store's image after years of high-profile <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/11/28/7283835/walmart-black-friday-protests"" target=""_blank"">protests</a> for higher pay, including last year's Black Friday demonstrations demanding a $15 hourly wage.</p> \n<h3>The labor market is improving</h3> \n<p>Walmart is the US's largest private employer, accounting for nearly 1 percent of the nation's non-farm workers, so it means something big when that company decides to boost its wages. It's another clear sign of labor market improvement.</p> \n<p>After all, one of the closest-watched indicators in recent monthly job reports has been hourly wages. If those tick up, it's a sign that the labor market is tightening, and that employers have to raise wages to hold onto or attract the talent they want. Last month, the jobs report showed that pay is already increasing, with average hourly wages jumping by <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/2/6/7991537/nonfarm-payrolls-january-2015/in/7751602"" target=""_blank"">12 cents</a>, the biggest jump in nearly eight years.</p> \n<p>Walmart's announcement signals that the company wants to keep attracting good talent and doesn't want to lose its workers to competitors — which in turn signals that there's increased competition to get good workers. This also squares with other recent, encouraging jobs data — in December, US employers had the most job openings since 2001 and the highest level of hires in seven years, <a href=""http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-02-10/job-openings-in-u-s-rose-by-181-000-in-december-to-5-03-million"" target=""_blank"">Bloomberg reported</a>. The number of workers voluntarily quitting their jobs also jumped, a sign that people are either leaving their jobs for other opportunities or are confident enough to quit before they have a new job lined up.</p>",Business & Finance
"The increasingly bizarre standoff between Greece and the Eurozone, explained",http://www.vox.com/2015/2/19/8068957/greece-eurozone,"Greece tried to surrender, then Germany said no and didn't explain why.","<ol> \n<li>Greece and the Eurozone appeared to reach a deal early on Thursday morning, US east coast time, and then it fell apart.</li> \n<li>Financial markets jacknifed, with a whole range of indicators — interest rates on Greek bonds, the euro:dollar exchange rate, etc. — shooting one way then the other way then back again in a very brief span of time.</li> \n<li>The key is that Greece's new government made an offer everyone thought European officials would agree to, and then the German finance ministry turned it down. </li> \n<li>This could be a sign of ever-narrowing disagreements and a prelude to an 11th-hour deal, or a weird moment after which everything spins out of control.</li> \n</ol> \n<h3>Greece's new government has big promises and little leverage</h3> \n<p>The backdrop is that on January 25th, a <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/1/25/7888093/greek-election-results"">far-left party called Syriza won an election in Greece</a>. Syriza has never served as a member of a coalition before, but suddenly it was running the show. Syriza's platform called for an end to the austerity budgets forced on Greece years ago, called for the re-hiring of many laid off civil servants, called for the cancellation of privatizations that were promised by earlier Greek governments, and called for a doubling of the minimum wage. But Syriza's platform also called for Greece to stay inside the Eurozone.</p> \n<p>Syriza's problem is that it has very little leverage with which to make all of those things happen.</p> \n<p>As a result, after weeks of huffing and puffing, it appeared early this morning that Greece was prepared to kick the can down the road and accept a deal with the Eurozone in which there would be no big changes for at least six more months. Then Germany rather unexpectedly rejected that proposal. Two consecutive tweets from Die Zeit's economics editor tell the story:</p> \n<p> </p> \n<blockquote class=""twitter-tweet"" lang=""en""> \n<p>we are hearing deal will be done, germany ready to go for it</p> \n— Mark Schieritz (@schieritz) <a href=""https://twitter.com/schieritz/status/568368762937856000"">February 19, 2015</a>\n</blockquote> \n<p> </p> \n<p>But no!</p> \n<p> </p> \n<blockquote class=""twitter-tweet"" lang=""en""> \n<p>German finance ministry: letter from Greece not acceptable</p> \n— Mark Schieritz (@schieritz) <a href=""https://twitter.com/schieritz/status/568384771363110914"">February 19, 2015</a>\n</blockquote> \n<p> </p> \n<h3>What the fight is really about</h3> \n<p>The conflict between Greece on the one hand and Germany and other Eurozone states on the other can get somewhat confusing because a lot of the attention is <em>ostensibly</em> on the question of whether or not Greece will request or accept a new extension of the bailout program that's been in place for years. A bailout extension means that Greece gets new loans that let it roll over old loans.</p> \n<p>Economically speaking, though, this is a red herring. Greece currently runs what's called a <em>primary surplus</em>, meaning that tax revenue covers current spending. New borrowing is only needed to pay off interest on old borrowing. This superficially appears to give the Greek government a lot of leverage. The only thing they need new money from creditors for is to pay off old debts to creditors, so in theory they can just walk away, default, and wipe their hands of the whole thing.</p> \n<p>The real issue is Greek banks.</p> \n<p>Greek banks are regulated by the European Central Bank. Greek banks also depend on the ECB for liquidity — for the short-term loans banks need to stay in operation. If the ECB decides it's lost faith in the Greek government, it can use either the liquidity lever or the regulatory lever to squeeze the Greek banking system. If the Greek banking system is squeezed hard enough, Greece could be forced to leave the Eurozone. If Greece doesn't want to leave the Eurozone, Greece needs to stay on the ECB's good side. And the ECB has made it clear that staying on the ECB's good side means reaching a deal with the other Eurozone countries over the bailout.</p> \n<p>So the bailout is crucial, but not because of the money involved. It's simply the issue on which the ECB has chosen to make its stand.</p> \n<h3>What Greece proposed</h3> \n<p>After weeks of acrimony, name-calling, and occasional bouts of confusion the Greek government made a proposal on Thursday that seemed like a huge climbdown. They had previously said they wanted to tear up the old deals, and now said they wanted a six months extension. The <a href=""http://m.spiegel.de/media/media-35954.pdf"">letter from the Greek finance ministry</a> seemed to simply ask that the status quo endure for six more months, while asking the rest of the Eurogroup to simply acknowledge Greece's desire for more lenient terms.</p> \n<p>This seemed to most like Germany essentially getting what it wanted, so the rejection by German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble came as a big surprise.</p> \n<h3>The larger political context</h3> \n<p>Most of the best coverage of the situation is found in business sections or business-oriented publications. But an important subtext to the negotiations concerns partisan politics. Syriza is the only far-left party to participate in a governing coalition in Europe. Europe's other governments are either run by center-right parties who wouldn't mind seeing a far-left government humiliated for ideological reasons, or else by center-left parties who wouldn't want to see a far-left party victorious lest it induce their own base to defect to the local far-left.</p> \n<p>In particular, European leaders don't want to do anything that <a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/eurozone-crisis/podemos-spain"">will further encourage the rise of the new, leftist Spanish party Podemos</a>, a factor that is probably leaving the Greeks with less flexibility than they might enjoy in a vacuum.</p> \n<h3>What happens next?</h3> \n<p>The German Finance Ministry has not really clarified the nature of its opposition. Nor have we heard from the finance ministers of other Eurozone countries. It is certainly conceivable that Germany's objections will turn out to be small, especially after consultations with other countries. On the other hand, it is also possible that the Germans will genuinely hold to a hard line and insist that Syriza utterly and completely surrender.</p> \n<p>As is often the case in Eurozone matters, the need to coordinate over a dozen different national governments — many of which are themselves multi-party coalitions — plus several distinct European-level institutions tends to create a fair amount of confusion. At the moment, everyone seems to be playing things relatively quietly, which could be a sign of an imminent deal or an imminent blowup.</p>",Business & Finance
Apple really seems to be building an Apple Car. That's not as crazy as it sounds.,http://www.vox.com/2015/2/19/8070871/apple-car-hiring-spree,"Apple has been scooping up talent from Ford, Tesla, and other companies in the auto business.","<p>We've <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/2/16/8043673/apple-car-icar"">known since last week</a> that Apple was working on some sort of car-related project. The big question was whether Apple was working on a line of car accessories — perhaps expanding on its existing <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/1/7/7508085/car-smartphone-carplay-ces"">CarPlay platform</a> — or whether the company was going to start building its own cars.</p> \n<p><a href=""http://9to5mac.com/2015/02/19/apple-electric-car-team/"">New reporting</a> from 9to5Mac provides strong evidence that Apple is working on an Apple Car.</p> \n<p>Cars are complicated, and building one requires skills that a high-tech company like Apple doesn't normally have. According to 9to5Mac, Apple has been snapping up engineers with expertise in motors, transmissions, drive trains, car interiors, and so forth.</p> \n<p>The list includes four people with experience at Ford, four who previously worked at Tesla, a former CEO of Mercedes-Benz, and a General Motors employee. Apple has also hired an engineer from auto-part maker EMCO Gears and multiple engineers from A123 Systems, which makes batteries for hybrid and electric cars (A123 has <a href=""http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/02/19/us-apple-autos-lawsuit-idUSKBN0LN04Y20150219"">sued Apple</a> over these hires).</p> \n<p>It's unlikely that Apple would hire people like this if it were only working on car accessories. And it wouldn't hire <a href=""http://www.wsj.com/articles/apples-titan-car-project-to-challenge-tesla-1423868072"">hundreds of people</a> just to work on a pilot project. Granted, Apple CEO Tim Cook could still decide to cancel it if the results aren't up to Apple's standards. But there's a good chance we'll see some kind of Apple Car in the next few years.</p> \n<h3>Apple is well-positioned to create a new kind of car</h3> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3425790/462369664.0.0.0.jpg"" alt=""462369664.0.0.0.jpg"" data-chorus-asset-id=""3425790""></p> \n<p> </p> \n<p class=""caption"">Apple reinvented the phone. (Justin Sullivan/Getty)</p> \n<p> </p> \n<p>Apple may be better positioned to jump into the car business than almost any other Silicon Valley company. Most tech companies focus on one relatively narrow piece of the technology ""stack."" You've got Intel and AMD making computer chips, Dell and Samsung building devices, Google and Microsoft developing software, and so forth.</p> \n<p>Apple is virtually alone in building its own products from top to bottom. An iPhone is based on an Apple-designed chip and runs Apple-designed software. This philosophy makes Apple particularly good at re-inventing product categories, as it did with the iPod, iPhone, and iPad. It can build exactly the right hardware to support its software, and vice versa, creating a seamless user experience.</p> \n<p>This kind of tight integration between hardware and software will be particularly important for cars, where reliability and energy-efficiency are major priorities. Apple's work on iPhones, iPads, and MacBooks also means the company has experience with batteries and power management, which are also crucial to building electric cars.</p> \n<p>Indeed, this could be a weakness for Google, which has traditionally created software that runs on other peoples devices. Combining Google's self-driving software with a conventional car might produce a less appealing product than having one company design the whole product</p> \n<h3>It won't be easy for Apple to catch up to Google on self-driving technology</h3> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3425788/v2.0.0.png"" alt=""v2.0.0.png"" data-chorus-asset-id=""3425788""></p> \n<p> </p> \n<p class=""caption"">A self-driving car prototype from Google.</p> \n<p> </p> \n<p>By the time Apple brings a car to market, <a href=""http://www.theverge.com/2015/1/6/7499437/bmw-touch-command-tablet-samsung-gestures-ces-2015"">partially self-driving cars will be commonplace</a> and fully autonomous vehicles may be right around the corner. To compete with Google, it will have to build its own self-driving technology. And that won't be easy.</p> \n<p>Google has a five-year head start creating self-driving cars. It also has a fleet of Street View cars that will allow it to produce detailed 3D maps of the world's streets, which will be essential to helping self-driving cars stay on the road. Apple doesn't have a great track record with maps — Apple has <a href=""http://www.theverge.com/2012/9/20/3363914/wrong-turn-apple-ios-6-maps-phone-5-buggy-complaints"">struggled</a> to produce a mapping app that rivals Google Maps.</p> \n<p>Google also has a culture that prizes tackling difficult engineering problems — dubbed ""moon shots"" — like building a self-driving car. In contrast, Apple has traditionally been focused on building beautiful, user-friendly gadgets. When it has tried to expand outside of that core area — as with <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/6/2/5773688/why-icloud-drive-will-probably-be-a-flop"">iCloud</a> and its predecessors — the results have often been disappointing.</p> \n<p>On the other hand, building a beautiful, reliable, and energy-efficient electric car would be a major feat in its own right.

For example, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a public interest group, <a href=""https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/02/further-evidence-lenovo-breaking-https-security-its-laptops"" target=""_blank"">says</a> that ""Lenovo's decision to ship this software was catastrophically irresponsible and an utter abuse of the trust their customers placed in them.""</p> \n<h3>What does the Superfish software do?</h3> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""3426698"" alt=""15547995367_b77dbf0f5d_b.0.jpg"" src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3426698/15547995367_b77dbf0f5d_b.0.jpg""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">(<a href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/lattefarsan/15547995367"" target=""_blank"">Patrik Nygren</a>)</p> \n<p>Lenovo says the software was designed to ""help customers potentially discover interesting products while shopping."" Superfish is an image search company. The idea behind the software is that when your web browser loads an image, Superfish identifies the image, figures out if it depicts a product, and then lists websites where you can get a better deal on that product.</p> \n<p>Lenovo claims that ""users are given a choice whether or not to use the product"" when they first started up their computers. However, it seems unlikely that users understood what they were agreeing to when they first booted up their newly-purchased PC.</p> \n<p>Superfish does one other thing that most adware does not. The company wanted to display ads on every website a user visits, but some websites — such as banks, email providers, and social media sites — use an encryption technology called SSL (short for Secure Sockets Layer) to protect users' privacy. Because SSL scrambles communications between websites and a user's web browser, Superfish couldn't intercept these pages and inject ads into them.</p> \n<p>So Superfish mounted what security officials called a man-in-the-middle attack: it intercepted SSL-based connections and impersonated the sites users were trying to reach. It unscrambled the users' communications, injected the ads, and then re-encrypted them before delivering them to their destination.</p> \n<h3>Why is that a security risk?</h3> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""3426702"" alt=""500995147_5f56493a1e_b.0.jpg"" src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3426702/500995147_5f56493a1e_b.0.jpg""></p> \n<p class=""caption""><span>(</span><a style=""font-size: 12px; line-height: 19.7999992370605px; background-color: #ffffff;"" href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/subcircle/500995147"" target=""_blank"">Nick Carter</a><span>)</span></p> \n<p>The SSL technology is specifically designed to prevent this kind of man-in-the-middle attack. After all, if anyone could impersonate your bank's website, then that little padlock you see in your address bar, indicating a secure connection, would be meaningless. So ordinarily, the browser should have recognized the subterfuge and warned the user that the connection wasn't secure.</p> \n<p>Browsers do this with SSL certificates, digital files that act as a kind of virtual ID card. Certificates are signed by trusted third parties, and they allow a browser to verify that they are really communicating with, say, bankofamerica.com rather than a Brazilian hacker impersonating Bank of America.</p> \n<p>Superfish modified the software on Lenovo computers so they would trust fake certificates generated by Superfish itself. So when a Lenovo user tried to visit bankofamerica.com, the software on her laptop would create a fake certificate telling the browser that the Superfish software owned the bankofamerica.com domain.</p> \n<p>Not only was this deceptive, it also opened Lenovo devices up to attacks from third parties. That's because malicious third parties could obtain Superfish's credentials and create their own fake certificates. And these certificates would be trusted by Lenovo computers afflicted with Superfish software. Our hypothetical Brazilian hacker could create a fake bankofamerica.com site that would be trusted by many Lenovo laptops.</p> \n<h3>I have a Lenovo computer!

The most important urban policy story in the world is happening in India,http://www.vox.com/2015/2/20/8072575/mumbai-fsi-reform,Mumbai is finally tackling its slum problem with the power of upzoning.,"<p>I've <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/The-Rent-Too-Damn-High-ebook/dp/B0078XGJXO"">written a lot over the years</a> about the harmful impact of restrictions on new residential housing in American cities. But it's really a global issue, and some of the most egregious cases happen in foreign countries. In fact, <a href=""http://www.business-standard.com/article/companies/realty-sector-welcomes-bmc-s-proposal-to-hike-fsi-in-greater-mumbai-115021700904_1.html"">a new initiative to upzone Mumbai, India</a> is probably the most important urban-policy development in the world today. It should fairly dramatically increase living standards in one of the biggest cities on the planet and possibly do a great deal to drive economic growth forward throughout India.</p> \n<p>Zoning news from the third world isn't the kind of thing most people in the west are going to pay attention to. But as India is both the world's largest democracy and has the world's largest concentration of poor people, its success or failure in generating rising living standards is a huge deal. And getting urban planning right is a huge piece of that.</p> \n<h3>The dysfunctional status quo in Mumbai</h3> \n<p>One important measurement in the urban-planning world is what Americans call Floor Area Ratio (FAR) and what Indians call Floor Space Index (FSI). FAR/FSI measures the ratio of built-out floor space to land area. In a suburban area full of one-floor buildings, large lawns, and generous parking lots you would expect FAR to be well below 1. In midtown Manhattan, which is full of very tall buildings, <a href=""http://www.nyc.gov/html/dcp/html/zone/zh_c6.shtml"">FARs get as high as 15</a>.</p> \n<p>Mumbai currently has a regulatory ceiling of 1.33 FAR for the central city and 1 for more outlying areas. In the United States, a 1.33 FAR would probably be a neighborhood full of three story row-houses. In other words, a kind of low-density residential urbanism.</p> \n<p>But making this the maximum allowed building density in a low-income city of 12 million people has created a very different situation: Mumbai's infamous hyper-crowded slums, as seen in Katherine Boo's <em><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Behind-Beautiful-Forevers-Mumbai-Undercity/dp/081297932X"">Beyond the Beautiful Forevers</a>.</em> <a href=""http://alainbertaud.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/AB-Mumbai-FSI-Conundrun-Revised_June-2013_kk-ab1.pdf"">Alain Berteaud points out</a> that contrary to what you might guess, ""a lot of slum dwellers are gainfully employed and are not poor in terms of their relative income. Rather, they are the victims of a number of misguided land use policies and of a lack of government investments in infrastructure.""</p> \n<p>By Indian standards, in other words, Mumbai has good opportunities for jobs and incomes. So people have flooded into the city. But the city has not allowed for remotely adequate levels of new construction. Consequently, by 2009 the average Mumbai resident had just 48 square feet of residential space at his disposal compared to about 365 square feet in Shanghai.</p> \n<h3>The proposed change</h3> \n<p>Greater Mumbai's governing authority is proposing a sweeping change to the permitted FARs in the area. Under the plan, Mumbai would be divided into five zones with an FAR of 8 allowed in the very densest areas and FARs in the 5-6 range in places well-served by mass transit. Fifty-eight percent of the city's land area would remain below 3.5, but even that could mean significant increases in the amount of building allowed in many areas.</p> \n<p>New construction should have four major economic impacts:</p> \n<ol> \n<li>Existing Mumbai residents should be able to obtain more living space for themselves, allowing for higher real living standards even in the absence of wage increases.</li> \n<li>It should become more feasible for more Indians to relocate to Mumbai and its relatively robust economy, increasing wages and productivity nationwide. </li> \n<li>The new construction itself will generate jobs. </li> \n<li>With more space at their disposal, Mumbai residents can accumulate more consumer goods, increasing demand for higher-end products. </li> \n</ol> \n<p>The proposed change doesn't come directly from the central Indian government, but does reflect priorities of the still-relatively-new prime minister Narendra Modi. As leader of the Indian state of Gujarat he <a href=""http://nextcity.org/daily/entry/what-narendra-modi-indias-likely-next-prime-minister-will-mean-for-cities"">increased density in several cities</a> and often linked new building permits to infrastructure funding.</p> \n<p>Even a city as large as Mumbai contains only a relatively small fraction of India's vast population. But it is in many respects the country's most economically dynamic metropolis, so its decisions have big national implications. And if the change goes through and is seen to pay off, it could inspire further reforms across the country that give urban Indians the opportunity for better homes and better lives.</p>",Business & Finance
Capital controls â€” how Greece could stay in the Eurozone even without a deal,http://www.vox.com/2015/2/20/8076993/greece-capital-controls,It happened in Cyprus.,"<p>As negotiations between Greece and other Eurozone member states — most of all Germany — continue, there's growing speculation that Greece will be forced to leave the Eurozone. And if no deal is reached it might. But there is another policy the country can adopt that is in many ways politically and legally more likely: <em>capital controls</em>.</p> \n<p>That's finance jargon for legal restrictions on the ability to move money across national borders. Capital controls are in place in a lot of countries, ranging from China to Argentina. But they are rarely seen in the richest countries, and the idea of imposing capital controls on a country that is in a currency union is a little paradoxical. But capital controls are already in place in the small Eurozone state of Cyprus, and they could provide a solution — or at least a ""solution"" — to the Greco-German standoff that doesn't involve Greece leaving the Eurozone.</p> \n<h3>What's the problem in Greece?</h3> \n<p>Greece has a lot of problems. But its specific problem right now is that for Greek banks to keep functioning, they need to be backstopped by the European Central Bank. At the same time, the Greek government is deeply in debt to a bunch of other Eurozone countries as a result of a debt bailout it received years ago. Under the terms of that bailout, Greece needs to abide by a policy of fiscal austerity and also commit itself to various privatizations and labor market deregulations. A new government <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/1/25/7888093/greek-election-results"">came to power in Greece in January</a> promising to reverse all that, but they have not succeeded in <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/2/19/8068957/greece-eurozone"">convincing Germany to let them</a>.</p> \n<p>The ECB has made it pretty clear that it won't keep supporting Greek banks if Greece can't reach a deal with its Eurozone creditors. And if the ECB pulls its support, the entire Greek banking system would collapse.</p> \n<p>There is one way to save the banking system in that scenario: the Greek government could start issuing a new currency of its own and use that currency to support its banks outside the ECB's purview. That, of course, would mean leaving the Eurozone.</p> \n<h3>The capital controls alternative</h3> \n<p>One big problem with leaving the Eurozone (""Grexit"" they call it) is that there's no legal mechanism through which it can be done. That doesn't mean it's impossible, but it does mean it would be quite chaotic. For one thing, the Greek economy relies on contracts that are written in terms of euros, which would all have to be revisited in light of an exit.</p> \n<p>Another, potentially more cooperative way forward is capital controls. Greece could impose severe legal restrictions on Greek people's ability to shift their euros out of the country, leaving them with no alternative but to trust the Greek banking system. That, combined perhaps with some limited support from the ECB, could keep Greek banks running even in the absence of a deal.</p> \n<p>Greek people and companies would still be able to fulfill the terms of old euro-denominated contracts without entering into a legal grey zone, and European visitors to Greece could keep spending their euros.</p> \n<h3>The Cyprus precedent</h3> \n<p>A clear precedent for this exists in Cyrpus, where a 2013 banking and fiscal crisis was resolved <a href=""http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2013/03/20/capital_controls_for_cyprus.html"">with the use of capital controls</a>, among other things.</p> \n<p>Cyprus still uses the euro as its currency, but as you can read on their central bank's websites there are <a href=""http://www.centralbank.gov.cy/nqcontent.cfm?a_id=12610"">tons of legal restrictions on what a Cypriot can do with his euros</a>. Cypriot euros are semi-trapped inside Cyprus, whereas as Belgian euro can fly all around the eurozone or even be traded for dollars. Consequently, in practical terms a Cypriot euro is less valuable than a Belgian (or Finnish or Irish or Portugese or German) euro. This raises some metaphysical questions as to whether Cyprus really has the same currency as the rest of the Eurozone — after all, lots of currencies are <em>called dollars</em> but that doesn't make them US dollars — but officially the capital controls are only ""temporary"" and Cyprus is a member of the club.</p> \n<p>You could imagine something similar happening in Greece. Cyprus' temporary controls are still in place with no end in site, and Greece might languish in capital control land for a long time. But unlike an official exit from the Eurozone, a capital control scenario wouldn't be irreversible. The Syriza government could collapse, and the Eurozone could hold out the promise of reversing the capital controls if a new coalition comes to power and returns to the bargaining table.</p>",Business & Finance
Bill DeBlasio has a new plan that could put a dent in NYC's housing crisis,http://www.vox.com/2015/2/21/8080237/nyc-zoning-reform,"Taller buildings, and lower parking requirements.","<p>Ever since he won election in 2013, New York City Mayor Bill DeBlasio has talked a lot about affordable housing. On Friday afternoon his administration rolled out its most promising initiative on this yet — a <a href=""http://www.nyc.gov/html/dcp/html/zoning-qa/zoning-for-affordability-1.shtml"">broad change to the city's zoning code</a> that should allow for the construction of housing units.</p> \n<h3>DeBlasio's plan</h3> \n<p>The proposed reform has three main elements:</p> \n<ol> \n<li>Reduces parking requirements for senior or low-income housing </li> \n<li>Allows taller buildings</li> \n<li>Allows more flexibility in designing housing for senior citizens</li> \n</ol> \n<p>None of this alters the key zoning metric known as <em>Floor Area Ratio, </em>which is the ratio of built-out floorspace to total land occupied. In other words, if you have 6000 square feet of apartments sitting on top of a 2000 square foot lot, you have an FAR of 3. But it all works together to make it considerably cheaper and easier for developers to craft structures that maximize the permitted floor area ratio.</p> \n<p><em>Parking: </em>Currently, outside of central Manhattan essentially all new buildings in New York City are required to include new parking spaces — driving up the cost of real estate in a city where land is extremely scarce.<strong> </strong>DeBlasio is proposing to eliminate minimum parking space regulations for senior citizen or low-income housing if it is either near a subway station or includes access to an off-site parking facility. He is also proposing to reduce the amount of parking required for senior citizen or low-income housing even if it's far from transit. Last, he wants to ""create a process to allow, where appropriate and on a case-by-case basis, reduction of parking requirements to facilitate mixed-income development, or affordable housing developments with existing underutilized parking facilities to be redeveloped.""</p> \n<p><em>Building height:</em> DeBlasio is proposing, essentially, that developers should have the flexibility to build structures that are tall enough to reach the maximum FAR allowed. Currently, height restrictions are often poorly matched to FAR rules. A zone might allow for an FAR of 5.0 but also prohibit buildings that are tall enough to achieve this in a sensible way. At best, developers can make it work by employing either short ceilings or very boxy buildings with no setbacks or courtyards. At worst, they simply don't build out to the maximum FAR. This is especially important because current law offers developers FAR bonuses for including affordable housing in their projects. Often, however, height limits make it impossible to take advantage of this opportunity. The new rules should increase the production of both subsidized and market rate housing.</p> \n<p><em>Senior housing:</em> DeBlasio is proposing to allow more flexibility in terms of combining nursing home units with other types of senior-focused housing, as well as easing the permit process to get permission to build assisted living units.</p> \n<h3>Big gains, more could be done</h3> \n<p>These are very positive steps to address a huge problem that <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/7/15/5901041/nimbys-are-costing-the-us-economy-billions"">costs the American economy billions of dollars in output each year</a>. But of course New York City could go further. Regulatory mandates that new buildings include parking spaces, for example, are no more reasonable for market rate housing than for subsidized affordable units.</p> \n<p>More to the point, even though New York City is the country's largest city, it is only a relatively small slice of the overall affordable housing problem. Most residents of Greater New York, and of every other metropolitan area, live in suburban jurisdictions where the anti-affordability rules are generally even more severe. Tackling the nationwide affordability crisis will ultimately require zoning relaxation not just in New York, but in central cities <em>and their suburbs</em> up and down both coasts.</p> \n",Business & Finance

While a bit tongue-in-cheek, this description underscores the high stakes involved in the global dash to create a battery powerful enough to run an electric car 300 miles on a single charge. The current sprinters? Japan, South Korea, China and the United States.</p> \n<p><span>There aren't very many inventions that can do substantial good in the world </span><i style=""font-size: 1.15em; line-height: 1.65;"">and</i><span> help their makers get wildly rich in the process. But according to LeVine, Washington correspondent for </span><i style=""font-size: 1.15em; line-height: 1.65;"">Quartz</i><span> and a Future Tense Fellow at New America, a superbattery-one that will improve upon the lithium-ion battery and thereby take electric cars mainstream-is just that kind of invention. Those who bring it to market will cash in to the potential tune of $300 billion and the rest of us will breathe progressively less polluted air as we traverse the roadways in our all-electric vehicles.</span></p> \n<p><span>In </span><i style=""font-size: 1.15em; line-height: 1.65;"">The Powerhouse</i><span>, LeVine reveals the drama generated by the lithium-ion battery by tracking two parallel narratives: the work at Argonne National Laboratory's battery program, home to scientists LeVine calls the world's ""battery geniuses,"" and efforts of Silicon Valley start-ups like EnVia Systems (the first licensee for Argonne's material). Researchers in both settings are racing to build a product marketable enough to secure contracts and a billion-dollar IPO. The book, says Levine, is ""reflective of that environment...where so much hope and buzz and really a fever had come to center on the battery.""</span></p> \n<p><span>As these dual stories unfold, LeVine explained at a recent event at New America, ""It's not quite a collision course, but they're driving down the same lanes."" As a storyteller, he added, it was important to him for the book ""not to be a hagiography about technology and invention,"" but rather an account of how innovation happens, viewed through the lens of a colorful set of characters.</span></p> \n<p><span>One of those characters is Jeff Chamberlain, manager of the Argonne battery program, who is ""this evangelistic motivator, painting the stakes in very large colors."" Those brush-strokes add up to a portrait of fear, notes LeVine, because the pressure is fierce to hit the finish line first. Since Sony commercialized the lithium-ion battery in 1991 and Toyota unveiled the Prius in 1996, transformative battery innovations have been scarce, and both President Obama and China's Minister of Science and Technology have vowed publicly to put one million electric cars on the road in 2015 (a goal that neither will achieve this year but to which both remain committed in the longer term, though China recently saw </span><a href=""http://fortune.com/2015/02/19/chinas-electric-car-boom-should-tesla-motors-worry/?xid=gn_editorspicks"" style=""font-size: 1.15em; line-height: 1.65; background-color: #ffffff;"">a surge of electric vehicle sales</a><span> in 2014 ). The idea that China might win the battery race is, to LeVine's mind, the ""bête noir"" for scientists like Chamberlain.</span></p> \n<p><span>Another theme that LeVine emphasized in his conversation with Donna Harris, co-founder of the start-up hub 1776, was the effect of what could be called the ""Bell Labs diaspora."" Alumni of Bell Labs, which developed the transistor in the late 1940s, populate the entire ecosystem of the battery race, from university laboratories to government agencies to industry. Between Energy Secretary Steven Chu's proposed creation of ""Bell Lablets"" and the widespread realization that Bell's managerial system could be conducive to greater innovation, previously bitter rivals like Matt Thackeray's Berkeley lab and Chamberlain's team at Argonne managed to forge collaborations that made them both more competitive in the superbattery sprint.</span></p> \n<p><span>It's important to remember that neither the electric car nor the superbattery are </span><i style=""font-size: 1.15em; line-height: 1.65;"">fait accompli</i><span>, LeVine pointed out: ""Just because we want them and the stakes are so high doesn't mean they will happen."" To reap the dividends, all the stakeholders in the race need to re-think their assumptions. For Chamberlain and his compatriots, this meant admitting that they need a new roadmap, to ""understand the science [of batteries] at the atomic level"" and work from there.</span></p> \n<p><span>For those in business and government, LeVine argues, re-thinking things means putting together a format for participation that ""jettisons our allergy to violating [a] free market ethos and coming up with a formula of intellectual property-sharing that involves industry </span><i style=""font-size: 1.15em; line-height: 1.65;"">and </i><span>the inventors."" He dismisses as ""foolhardy"" the industry forecasting that predicts that 25 years from now, electric, fuel-cell, natural gas, and plug-in hybrid cars will only comprise 5 percent of the market. ""We live in an age of utter disruption,"" he marveled, citing shale oil and gas as two examples of game-changers that no one predicted.</span></p> \n<p><span>Along with cutthroat competition and the promise of future innovation in the race for the superbattery, warns LeVine, comes a healthy dose of bullshit, which he says is often the cost of doing business in technology-no matter whether you're in a lab or a start-up. Looking back on his research for </span><i style=""font-size: 1.15em; line-height: 1.65;"">The Powerhouse, </i><span>LeVine was surprised by the pervasiveness of the ""exaggeration, hype, and lies."" He reflected to Harris, ""Edison famously said in the 1920s that batteries-especially rechargeable batters-are a special province of liars. And there is a twist in the book where we learn that law. That was a very big shock to me.""</span></p> \n<p>But when you've published a book about a technology race that's still being run, twists and turns come with the territory.</p>",Business & Finance
How long can Google keep investing in outlandish science projects?,http://www.vox.com/2015/2/23/8089921/google-research-lab,Wall Street is becoming skeptical of Google's moonshot ideas like self-driving cars and balloons that beam down wind power.,"<p>America's largest companies are <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/2/4/7965967/corporate-research-basic-science"">investing way less in science</a> than they used to.

But that’s increasingly a rare sight.</p> \n<p>And to see why, just look at Google.</p> \n<p>Google, after all, <em>is</em> still a company where scientists pursue long-shot ideas.

As Conor Dougherty <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/16/business/google-aims-for-sky-but-investors-start-to-clamor-for-profits.html?smid=tw-share&amp;_r=0"">reports in an excellent </a><a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/16/business/google-aims-for-sky-but-investors-start-to-clamor-for-profits.html?smid=tw-share&amp;_r=0"">New York Times </a><a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/16/business/google-aims-for-sky-but-investors-start-to-clamor-for-profits.html?smid=tw-share&amp;_r=0"">story</a>, Wall Street is getting antsy about many of Google’s moonshot projects — particularly after the recent failure of Google Glass:</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>After patiently abiding a steep increase in research and development spending on efforts that range from biology to space exploration, Wall Street is starting to wonder when — and if — Google’s science projects will pay off.</p> \n<p>""We want companies to continue to push the envelope, but there has to be some financial responsibility around that,"" said Ben Schachter, an analyst at Macquarie Securities. ""We have no real insight into what’s going on.""</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>For a long time, Google could resist these pressures because it dominated the search and advertising business. The company was doing spectacularly well, and investors didn’t mind if Google tinkered with offbeat ideas like self-driving cars that had a small shot of being wildly lucrative. It also helps that Google's <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/4/16/5621932/most-companies-have-to-worry-about-what-wall-street-thinks-heres-why"">unusual corporate structure</a> gives founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin majority control, leaving them better-positioned to fend off Wall Street's demands.</p> \n<p>But now Google’s advertising revenue is growing more slowly, and analysts <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/roberthof/2014/04/16/despite-revenue-growth-google-again-disappoints-investors-in-q1/"">are increasingly second-guessing</a> the company’s spending on wild dreams that may never pan out, like <a href=""http://www.cnet.com/news/google-x-head-says-no-google-jetpacks-coming/"" target=""_blank"">jetpacks</a> or <a href=""http://www.google.com/makani/"" target=""_blank"">wind power from kites</a>.</p> \n<h3>Many US firms face pressure to invest less in science</h3> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3436700/v2.0.0.0.png"" alt=""v2.0.0.0.png"" data-chorus-asset-id=""3436700""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">A prototype of Google's custom-built self-driving car. (Google)</p> \n<p>A similar tale happened throughout corporate America during the late 20th century. When companies like AT&amp;T and IBM dominated their respective fields, they could afford to run wide-ranging research labs. The scientists in these labs <a href=""http://www.pantaneto.co.uk/issue56/odlyzko.htm"" target=""_blank"">were given immense freedom</a>, and some of their discoveries ended up being transformational. Bell Labs racked up eight Nobel Prizes for things like the transistor or the discovery of cosmic background radiation.</p> \n<p>The problem is that this R&amp;D work didn’t always pay off for the companies that had invested in it. Researchers at Xerox’s Palo Alto Research Center famously invented the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface"" target=""_blank"">graphical user interface</a>. But it was Apple that harnessed the idea to create the Macintosh. The same thing happened to Texas Instruments: its research lab <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit"" target=""_blank"">helped develop the integrated circuit</a>, only to watch Intel get rich off the idea.</p> \n<p>So, over time, the labs shrunk. Modern-day tech companies still spend a lot on R&amp;D, but they focus far more on short-term commercial applications than on fundamental research. As <em>The Economist </em><strong><a href=""http://www.economist.com/node/8769863"">reported</a></strong> in 2007, the R&amp;D budgets of companies like Microsoft, IBM, and Hewlett Packard mostly go ""into making small incremental improvements and getting new ideas to market fast.""</p> \n<p>A recent NBER working paper led by Atish Arora, a professor at Duke University's Fuqua School of Business, <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/2/4/7965967/corporate-research-basic-science"" target=""_blank"">quantified the trend</a>. Basic research makes up a much smaller portion of corporate R&amp;D than it used to:</p> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""3367930"" alt=""corporate_R_D.0.png"" src=""https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3367930/corporate_R_D.0.png""></p> \n<p style=""text-align: start;"" class=""caption"">National Science Foundation/Division of Science Resources Statistics, Survey of Industrial Research and Development: 2007. (Arora et al 2015)</p> \n<p>Arora and his co-authors point to a number of possible factors, such as the fact that firms are no longer as diversified as they used to be (giving them less incentive to research widely, the way companies like DuPont did). But the trend appears real.</p> \n<p>In recent years, Google had stood out as an exception — a company that still shot for the moon. But even Google’s now facing calls to show more immediate results by investors with shorter time horizons.</p> \n<p>As Dougherty <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/16/business/google-aims-for-sky-but-investors-start-to-clamor-for-profits.html?smid=tw-share&amp;_r=0"" target=""_blank"">reports</a>, the company is trying to placate Wall Street by pointing to some of its computer-science research like <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Brain"" target=""_blank"">Google Brain</a>, a neural network that helps computers read text and will have more obvious practical implications. Google officials told the <i>Times </i>that the company's R&amp;D efforts — which now amount to 12 percent of revenue — have paid for themselves with this breakthrough alone.</p> \n<h3>Economists predict firms will under-invest in basic research</h3> \n<p>Broadly speaking, this is what economists <a href=""http://www.nber.org/chapters/c10793.pdf"" target=""_blank"">have long predicted</a> will happen. The value of basic research is greater to society as a whole than it is to any one individual company. So, in theory, companies are likely to invest less in this sort of research than is socially optimal. It’s quite hard for corporate research labs like Google X to persist over time.</p> \n<p>That’s a potential problem because science and basic research has long been a huge driver of US economic growth. So if private companies are investing less in it, someone else needs to pick up the slack.</p> \n<p>In the United States, that slack has been picked up since the 1980s by universities and the federal government, which are bearing more of the research load. (Indeed, Google <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/budget/report/2014/09/02/96182/closing-the-science-gap/"">owes its existence</a> to a page-rank algorithm developed at Stanford University under a federal research grant.)

For example, ""if a manager picked Apple, did it perform better than the tech sector?"" The bars in this chart show how each hedge fund performed compared to someone who just bought all the stocks in the categories hedge funds chose.</p> \n<p>As you can see, the results are not pretty. Fewer than 20 percent of hedge funds achieved better returns than they would have gotten if they'd just invested in broad industry categories. Over a longer, three-year time horizon, hedge funds appear to have done about as well as the broader market, with about half of hedge funds earning above-average returns and half earning below-average ones.</p> \n<p>So does this mean people (at least those rich enough to invest in hedge funds in the first place) should buy into one of the funds with the above-average returns in 2014? Probably not. While it's possible that these funds are run by managers with a knack for beating the market, there's also a good chance they just got lucky. Studies have shown that it's very difficult to beat the market, and <a href=""http://www.rickferri.com/WhitePaper.pdf"" target=""_blank"">most mutual funds</a> that try to do so fail. A fund that over-performs one year is just as likely to under-perform the next year. There's little reason to think hedge funds are different.</p> \n<p>But hedge funds have a huge disadvantage over most other investment vehicles: every year, they generally charge customers two percent of the funds invested, and 20 percent of any profits earned on top of that. That acts as a consistent drag on returns. This might explain why the average hedge fund has dramatically under-performed the broader market over the last decade, as shown in <a href=""http://www.aei.org/publication/sunday-afternoon-links-6/"" target=""_blank"">this chart</a> from Mark Perry:</p> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""3438804"" alt=""hedgefunds1.0.jpg"" src=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3438804/hedgefunds1.0.jpg""></p> \n<p>A better investment strategy is to simply accept that you're not going to be able to get above-average investment returns and focus instead on keeping management expenses <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/2/6/7983147/mutual-fund-rip-off"" target=""_blank"">as low as possible</a>.</p> \n<p><b>Update:</b> Hedge funds think it's unfair to compare them to a portfolio of stocks and bonds.

But the key reforms promised here mostly relate to the tax code and tax administration. Before the financial crisis, Greece was essentially running a European-style level of public spending with an American-style level of tax collection. The area where Greece's new left-wing government and Greece's European partners have the most room for common ground is on trying to raise Greek tax revenue. This is where Syriza's reform promises are most specific and enthusiastic.</p> \n<p>Syriza also promises to crack down on several dimensions of corruption, including promises to reduce civil service spending on things other than wages and pensions. For a flavor of what this means, even as the Greek stock exchange boomed on the news of the deal, shares in Greece's number one office furniture company tanked.</p> \n<blockquote class=""twitter-tweet"" lang=""en""> \n<p>yep, Greece's leading manufacturer of office furniture is tanking, after an announcement they'll focus on govt procurement fraud. awkward</p> \n— Dan Davies (@dsquareddigest) <a href=""https://twitter.com/dsquareddigest/status/570171842347929600"">February 24, 2015</a>\n</blockquote> \n<p>Elsewhere the deal largely reflects Syriza abandoning campaign promises and replacing them with verbal wiggle room about maybe doing things later. A promised doubling of the minimum wage is postponed indefinitely, and proposed rollbacks of changes to collective bargaining is turned into a proposal for ""a new ‘smart' approach to collective wage bargaining that balances the needs for flexibility with fairness.""</p> \n<p>The new Greek government also promises not to renege on privatizations that are already in progress, but affords itself the opportunity to slow down or perhaps avoid any future privatizations.</p> \n<p>Last but by no means least, the memo pays lip service to Syriza's promises to increase social spending to alleviate the humanitarian crisis in Greece. But it also commits Syriza to balanced budgets. Consequently, their ability to deliver on this in practice is going to be very linked to their ability to actually increase tax revenue.</p> \n<h3>Who won?</h3> \n<p>The standoff is often portrayed as a kind of zero-sum conflict between Germany and Greece. In that view, Germany pretty clearly ""won"" as Greece has little objective leverage. But in the real world, public policy is not zero sum and both Germany and Greece would benefit from improved policy in Greece and suffer from bad policy.</p> \n<p>In that view, this is a decent deal. The old arrangement in which a grand coalition of Greece's two long-governing parties were supposed to tackle the systematic corruption that they had created made very little sense. The questionable reform agenda was undergirded by extremely tight demands for budget surpluses, and the insistence on privatization risked becoming a fire sale of potentially valuable assets.</p> \n<p>Into the breach stepped Syriza, a far-left political party with roots in Greek Communism that had never governed before.</p> \n<p>The deal Syriza has now agreed to substantially undercuts the radical left elements of the Syriza agenda. At the same time, it does represent a more flexible approach to budgeting and what looks like a more sensible path to reform. There is absolutely no guarantee that the new Greek government will be able to actually deliver on tax reform and anti-corruption measures that have been promised, but it's at least <i>plausible </i>in a way that sticking with the old team wasn't. Meanwhile, Syriza has earned some flexibility on budgeting and the implementation of privatization. It's not the dawn of a whole new era of economic thinking, but it is a chance to prove themselves and to tackle some of Greece's longstanding problems.</p>",Business & Finance
How NIMBYism is holding back Silicon Valley and the American economy,http://www.vox.com/2015/2/25/8109437/how-nimbyism-is-holding-back-silicon-valley-and-the-american-economy,Some of America's most innovative technology companies want to expand their headquarters. But local governments in Silicon Valley are making it difficult.,"<p>Most city leaders would be overjoyed to be selected as the site of a new headquarters for one of the world's richest companies. But <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/26/technology/google-plans-new-headquarters-and-a-city-fears-being-overrun.html"">according to the New York Times</a>, the Mountain View City Council has been unenthusiastic about Google's plans to build a new headquarters there.</p> \n<p>City leaders are apparently worried about the traffic, and about further development changing the character of their city. They're also worried that Google employees could become a majority of the city's voter base, giving the company outsized influence over the city's politics.</p> \n<p>Other technology companies in the region have also faced resistance from not-in-my-backyard (NIMBY) advocates. The result: not only is the Valley failing to deal effectively with growing congestion and soaring housing costs, these myopic local policies could end up hampering the country's most important driver of economic growth. So what looks like a local issue has broader implications.</p> \n<p>Ignoring the pressure for more development is short-sighted. A better approach would be to accept that growth is inevitable and start planning ways to accommodate it gracefully. That means allowing high-density development in certain areas, positioning these developments so that some residents will be able to walk or bike to work, and making sure these areas are well-served by transit so they don't overwhelm the city's streets.</p> \n<p>One of the biggest problems in Mountain View (and surrounding cities) is that <a href=""http://www.clrsearch.com/Mountain-View-Demographics/CA/Travel-Time-and-Mode-of-Transportation"">more than 85 percent</a> of workers there get to work by car. That works fine in a typical suburb, but it's becoming increasingly untenable as the region becomes more populous.</p> \n<p>If Mountain View allowed high-density housing to be built in the area around Google's headquarters, that could not only help lower the area's <a href=""http://www.zillow.com/mountain-view-ca/home-values/"">sky-high housing costs</a>, it<strong> </strong>could also encourage more people to walk or bike to work, relieving some of that congestion.</p> \n<p>Higher densities work best in concert with a better system of public transit. Right now, the region's car-oriented development pattern makes it difficult to build a useful transit system. But if Mountain View allows the development of a walkable, high-density portion of the city, and other nearby cities do the same, that will make it more practical to build a system of buses — or perhaps someday a subway system — connecting them together.</p> \n<p>Another sign of how desperately the region needs better shared-transportation systems is the fact that Google and other companies have been forced to <a href=""http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/For-Google-shuttle-drivers-it-s-a-grueling-ride-5785556.php"">construct their own private bus systems</a> to bring employees in from San Francisco. These systems work fine for employees who have access to them, but it would be better for the region if Silicon Valley's transit infrastructure were good enough to make them unnecessary.</p> \n<p>The problem, as a city councilor in Apple's hometown of Cupertino put it to the Times, is that ""Nobody wants change."" A lot of residents in the area like their towns the way they are — or more precisely, the way they were 20 years ago before the dotcom boom started — and don't want to see the area gradually transformed into an urban area.</p> \n<p>But keeping things the same isn't really an option. These companies aren't going to stop <a href=""http://www.geekwire.com/2014/chart-amazon-nearly-hits-125k-employees-first-quarter-continuing-explosive-growth/"">growing</a>. Traffic problems are going to get worse and worse. And sooner or later, technology companies are going to convince some cities in the area to allow more development.</p> \n<p>Addressing these pressures proactively should allow cities to channel this growth in ways that will minimize disruption for longtime residents. Allowing new development in some parts of town can relieve road congestion and housing shortages in other neighborhoods.</p> \n<p>In fact, if Silicon Valley had more flexible housing markets, hundreds of thousands of people could move to the Bay Area to take advantage of the tight labor market and high wages in the area, boosting not just the region, but the nation's growth rate.</p> \n<p>Instead, these prospective workers are locked out by astronomical housing costs.

The FCC just approved the strongest net neutrality rules yet,http://www.vox.com/2015/2/26/8115361/fcc-net-neutrality-approved,The new regulations represent a victory for President Obama and internet activists.,"<ol> \n<li>The Federal Communications Commission has approved its strongest network neutrality rules yet.</li> \n<li>Three Democrats, including chairman Tom Wheeler, voted for the rules. The two Republicans dissented.</li> \n<li>The new rules reclassify internet access so it will be regulated like a public utility.</li> \n<li>The rules apply to both home broadband connections and the wireless networks that power smartphones.</li> \n</ol> \n<h3>The vote is a victory for network neutrality activists</h3> \n<p>Network neutrality is the idea that internet service providers (ISPs) should treat all internet traffic equally. It says your ISP shouldn’t be allowed to block or degrade access to certain websites or services, nor should it be allowed to set aside a ""fast lane"" that allows content favored by the ISP to load more quickly than the rest.</p> \n<p>The rules the FCC approved on Thursday were stronger than the ones Wheeler originally proposed last May. That proposal had attempted to protect network neutrality while staying within the bounds of a 2014 ruling that had invalidated the FCC's previous network neutrality rules. Critics argued that Wheeler's initial proposed rules were too weak, leaving a big loophole that would allow broadband providers to engage in exactly the kind of discriminatory behavior that network neutrality rules are supposed to prevent.</p> \n<p>Network neutrality advocates wanted to regulate broadband providers as public utilities, a step known to insiders as ""reclassification."" This move would give the agency broader authority to establish network neutrality rules. The activists mounted a successful lobbying campaign, submitting millions of comments to the agency urging a stronger stance. They gained an important ally in November when President Barack Obama <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/11/10/7186179/obamas-big-net-neutrality-announcement-explained"" target=""_blank"">endorsed reclassification</a>.</p> \n<p>The protests worked, prompting Wheeler to <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/2/4/7965379/fcc-net-neutrality-proposal"">back stronger rules</a> earlier this month. Here are Wheeler's comments prior to today's vote:</p> \n<p><!-- CHORUS_VIDEO_EMBED ChorusVideo:65734 --></p> \n<h3>The FCC's Republican commissioners blasted the move</h3> \n<p>The FCC vote fell along party lines, with the two Republicans on the commission opposing Chairman Wheeler's proposal. In comments before the vote, both commissioners blasted the move as a big government overreach.</p> \n<p>""We need to be focused on ways to promote deployment,"" said Commissioner Michael O’Rielly. He argued that with its network neutrality vote, the FCC was ""creating a vicious cycle where regulation deters investment in broadband, which stimulates more regulation.""</p> \n<p>The other Republican on the commission, Ajit Pai, agreed. He described the vote as a ""monumental shift toward government control of the internet.""</p> \n<p>Wheeler disagreed. ""This is no more a plan to regulate the internet than the First Amendment is a plan to regulate free speech,"" he said. ""The action that we take today is about the protection of internet openness.""</p> \n<p>Pai and O'Rielly are in the minority on the FCC, but they have powerful allies in Congress. In January, two key Republican leaders <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/1/21/7867869/net-neutrality-republican-compromise"" target=""_blank"">announced plans</a> to draft legislation that would protect network neutrality but take reclassification off the table. But so far that proposal has gotten a cold reception from Democrats, who prefer the stronger rules the FCC approved today.</p> \n<h3>The text of the new regulations may not be released for days</h3> \n<p>Consistent with longstanding practice, the FCC did not release its proposal in advance of today's vote. And the agency is not expected to release its rules, which are reported to be 317 pages long, later today either.</p> \n<p>However, the agency has released <a href=""http://transition.fcc.gov/Daily_Releases/Daily_Business/2015/db0204/DOC-331869A1.pdf"" target=""_blank"">a four-page fact sheet</a> describing its major provisions. And it reads like a wishlist for network neutrality activists. The rules will cover both wired and wireless networks, and it may also govern negotiations between last mile ISPs (such as Comcast or Verizon) and content providers (such as Netflix or Facebook).</p> \n<p>The rules would prohibit ISPs from blocking or throttling disfavored content. They would also ban paid prioritization — the practice of accepting payment to give some content a higher priority than others. Finally, it would require ISPs to be more transparent about how they run their networks.</p>",Business & Finance
FCC chair: Corporations shouldn't control access to the internet,http://www.vox.com/2015/2/26/8116655/tom-wheeler-net-neutrality,Chair Tom Wheeler cited public feedback on net neutrality rules as proof the internet needs to remain open.,"<p><!-- CHORUS_VIDEO_EMBED ChorusVideo:65734 --></p> \n<p>The Federal Communications Commission on Thursday <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/2/26/8115361/fcc-net-neutrality-approved"" target=""_blank"">approved</a> its strongest set of <a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/network-neutrality/whats-network-neutrality"" target=""_blank"">net neutrality</a> rules yet. Prior to the vote, FCC Chair Tom Wheeler pointed to the 4 million comments his agency received from the public throughout the process, using them as an example of why corporations shouldn't dictate access to the internet.</p> \n<p>""Those 4 million comments also illustrate the importance of an open and unfettered network, and the role it plays as a core of free expression and democratic principles,"" Wheeler said. ""While some other countries try to control the internet, the action that we take today is an irrefutable reflection of the principle that no one, whether government or corporate, should control a free and open access to the internet.""</p> \n<p>Wheeler hit the same point again and again in his speech: ""The internet is the ultimate vehicle for free expression. The internet is simply too important to allow broadband providers to be the ones making the rules.""</p> \n<p>Listen to the best segments of the speech above.</p>",Business & Finance
The net neutrality rules might not be available for weeks. That's ridiculous.,http://www.vox.com/2015/2/27/8120885/net-neutrality-transparency-fcc,The FCC's secretive process for drafting network neutrality rules dates back to 1946.,"<p>Yesterday the Federal Communications Commission established America's strongest network neutrality rules yet. The document, which reportedly weighed in at more than 300 pages, will transform how the nation's broadband services are regulated.</p> \n<p>But if you want to read it, you'll need to wait a few days. Or maybe weeks. That's ridiculous.</p> \n<p>It's true, as the Washington Post's Brian Fung <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2015/02/27/theres-already-a-conspiracy-theory-brewing-over-net-neutrality/"">writes</a>, that there's nothing unusual about the delay. Administrative agencies often keep drafts of their rules secret while they're working on them, and it's not uncommon for it to take a few weeks for rules to be published. The delay certainly isn't evidence that anything sinister is going on.</p> \n<p>But the FCC's secretive approach during rule drafting forces media to report on summaries, spin, and snippets. The result is less accurate and less comprehensive coverage. Meanwhile, the lack of transparency gives disproportionate influence to big players who can leverage their connections to insiders to find out what's really going on.</p> \n<p>The FCC isn't alone. It and other government agencies can and should be more transparent. Publishing draft rules before they're voted on, and publishing final rules as soon as they're approved, will make it easier for<strong> </strong>voters to understand and influence the process, for the media to provide accurate and comprehensive coverage. It will also curb the unfair advantages of special interests.</p> \n<h3>Our current rule-making process was designed in 1946</h3> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3453460/GettyImages_3314877.0.jpg"" alt=""GettyImages_3314877.0.jpg"" data-chorus-asset-id=""3453460""></p> \n<p> </p> \n<p class=""caption"">The Administrative Procedure Act, which still governs agency rulemaking, was signed by President Harry Truman. (Keystone/Getty Images)</p> \n<p> </p> \n<p>Modern administrative law has its roots in the 1946 Administrative Procedure Act, which established the process the FCC followed to put its network neutrality regulations into effect. The process started with the FCC publishing a notice of proposed rule-making, which in this case happened last May. Then, there was a mandatory public comment period, which generated more than 4 million responses.</p> \n<p>FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler completed a draft of his proposed network neutrality rules three weeks ago and distributed them to other FCC commissioners. He announced the rules in a <a href=""http://www.wired.com/2015/02/fcc-chairman-wheeler-net-neutrality/"">Wired op-ed</a> and posted a <a href=""http://transition.fcc.gov/Daily_Releases/Daily_Business/2015/db0204/DOC-331869A1.pdf"">4-page summary</a> to the FCC website. But he didn't release the actual language of his proposed regulation to the public. Eventually, the new rules will become public when they're published in the Federal Register. But that might not happen for a few more weeks.</p> \n<p>This was considered a transparent process by the standards of 1946. But in the age of the internet, the public justifiably expects more from the government. And administrative agencies like the FCC have not been keeping up.</p> \n<p>A big problem with the current approach is that it gives insiders unfair influence over the FCC's deliberations in the final days before the regulations are approved. As far as I know, no one outside of the FCC had access to full drafts of the final rule. Still, <em>someone</em> was feeding well-connected interest groups information about what the FCC was planning. For example, Google somehow got wind of a provision it thought would be counterproductive and <a href=""http://apps.fcc.gov/ecfs/document/view?id=60001032150"">sent the FCC a letter</a> last Friday urging a change. Reuters reported on another <a href=""http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/02/20/usa-internet-neutrality-idUSL1N0VU01W20150220"">last-minute lobbying blitz</a> against a provision that many regarded as too vague.</p> \n<p>In theory, the public was supposed to give the FCC this kind of feedback last year, during the official public comment period. But the FCC's plans have changed significantly since last May. Most of the language that sparked last-minute lobbying this month wasn't in the original proposal. So this kind of last-minute feedback is essential to helping the FCC avoid making a costly mistake.</p> \n<h3>The FCC could be a lot more transparent</h3> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3453468/3462607995_150a6b2624_b.0.0.0.jpg"" alt=""3462607995_150a6b2624_b.0.0.0.jpg"" data-chorus-asset-id=""3453468""></p> \n<p> </p> \n<p class=""caption"">These didn't exist in 1946. (<a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/9/25/6843949/the-bash-bug-explained"">Torkild Retvedt</a>)</p> \n<p> </p> \n<p>But there's no good reason for these things to be linked. Wheeler could have posted the full text of his proposal to the FCC's website three weeks ago, and then posted periodic updates. Then anyone — not just deep-pocketed interest groups — could read the draft and submit feedback to the FCC. That kind of public scrutiny would lead to better rules that are less tilted toward the interests of insiders.</p> \n<p>Nor is there any good reason to withhold the final text of the rule after the vote. Reportedly, a big reason for the delay is that the FCC's five commissioners are still working on their official public comments on the new regulations. We can expect the two Republican commissioners to make the case against the rules and the Democrats to make case for them. But the agency could easily release the text of the rule first, and these statements later.</p> \n<p>Withholding the actual text puts journalists at the mercy of the FCC's PR operation for information about what the regulation does. There's intense public interest in the FCC's new rule on the day it's approved. But if the text isn't public, we can only repeat the summaries the FCC has provided us. That summary might be biased or leave out important details.</p> \n<p>The FCC could learn a lot from the Supreme Court, which also publishes opinions making the case for and against the majority's decision. But the Supreme Court gets all of its opinions properly edited before the decision is released to the public. That means that the press and the public can read the full text of a Supreme Court opinion within minutes of when the court announces its decision. That allows the media to report on the court's full decision, instead of having to rely on summaries or leaks.</p> \n<p>The basic problem here is that regulatory agencies haven't adjusted to the capabilities of the internet. Back in 1946, there was no easy way for agencies to make draft regulations widely available — agencies didn't have websites, after all — so the procedures Congress laid out didn't require it. But thanks to the internet, agencies can and should be more transparent and move faster.</p>",Business & Finance
Bitcoin is down 60 percent this year. Here's why I'm still optimistic.,http://www.vox.com/2014/3/31/5557170/bitcoin-bad-currency-good-network,Bitcoins have lost more than 60 percent of their value this year. But their long-term outlook is still bright.,"<p>The markets haven't been kind to<span> </span><a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/bitcoin/"" style=""font-size: 17px; line-height: 28.4624996185303px;"">Bitcoin</a> in 2014. The currency reached a high of nearly $1,000 in January before falling to around $350 this month, a plunge of more than 60 percent. It would be easy to write Bitcoin off as a fad whose novelty has worn off.</p> \n<p>After all, dollars seem superior in almost every respect. T<span>hey're accepted everywhere, they're convenient to use, and they have a stable value. Bitcoin is an inferior currency on all three counts.</span></p> \n<p><q class=""right""><span>Bitcoin's detractors are making the same mistake as many Bitcoin fans</span> </q></p> \n<p><span>Yet it would be foolish to write Bitcoin off. The currency has had months-long slumps in the past, only to bounce back. </span>More importantly, it's a mistake to think about Bitcoin as a new kind of currency. W<span>hat makes Bitcoin potentially revolutionary is that it's the world's first completely open financial network.</span></p> \n<p><span>History suggests that open platforms like Bitcoin often become fertile soil for innovation. Think about the internet. It didn't seem like a very practical technology in the 1980s. But it was an open platform that anyone could build on, and in the long run it proved to be really useful.</span></p> \n<p>The internet succeeded because Silicon Valley have created applications that harness the internet's power while shielding users from its complexity. <span>You don't have to be an expert on the internet's TCP/IP protocols to check Facebook on your iPhone.</span></p> \n<p>Bitcoin applications can work the same way. There are already some Bitcoin applications that allow customers to make transactions over the Bitcoin network without being exposed to fluctuations in the value of Bitcoin's currency. That basic model should work for a wide variety of Bitcoin-based services, allowing the Bitcoin payment network to reach a mainstream audience.</p> \n<p><img src=""http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/assets/4215235/imp.jpg"" class=""photo"" alt=""Imp""></p> \n<p><span><span></span></span></p> \n<p class=""caption"">This is the very first node on the ARPANET, the predecessor to the Internet that launched in 1969. (Flickr/<a href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/fastlizard4/6294438012/"">FastLizard4</a>)</p> \n<p><span></span></p> \n<h3><span>The first open financial network</span></h3> \n<p>The Bitcoin network serves the same purpose as mainstream payment networks such as Visa or Western Union. But there's an important difference. The Visa and Western Union networks are owned and operated by for-profit companies. If you want to build a business based on one of those networks, you have to get permission from the owner.</p> \n<p>And that's not always easy. To use the Visa network, for example, you have to comply with <a href=""https://usa.visa.com/download/merchants/visa-international-operating-regulations-main.pdf"">hundreds of pages</a> of regulations. The Visa network also has high fees, and there are some things Visa won't let you do on its network at all.</p> \n<p>Bitcoin is different. Because no one owns or controls the network, there are no limits on how people can use it. Some people have used that freedom to do illegal things like buying drugs or gambling online. But it also means there's a low barrier to entry for building new Bitcoin-based financial services.</p> \n<p>There's an obvious parallel to the internet. Before the internet became mainstream, the leading online services were commercial networks like Compuserve and Prodigy. The companies that ran the network decided what services would be available on them.</p> \n<p><span>In contrast, the internet was designed for anyone to create new services. Tim Berners-Lee didn't need to ask anyone's permission to create the world wide web. He simply wrote the first web browser and web server and posted them online for others to download. Soon thousands of people were using the software and the web was born.</span></p> \n<h3>Finding Bitcoin's killer app</h3> \n<p>So what will people do with Bitcoin? It's hard to predict tomorrow's innovations, but we can get some idea of Bitcoin's potential by thinking about weaknesses of the conventional financial system.</p> \n<p><q class=""left""><span>Bitcoin is such a good deal for merchants that they may find it worthwhile to offer their customers discounts for paying with Bitcoin instead of cash or credit cards</span></q></p> \n<p>One obvious application is international money transfers. Companies like Western Union and Moneygram can charge as much as 8 percent to transfer cash from one country to another, and transfers can take as long as 3 days to complete. In contrast, Bitcoin transactions only take about 30 minutes to clear, and Bitcoin transaction fees could be a lot less than 8 percent.</p> \n<p>People have been <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/11/1/7139785/there-are-now-285-bitcoin-atms-around-the-world"">building Bitcoin ATMs</a> to let people convert between bitcoins and their local currency. The first Bitcoin ATM was launched a little over a year ago. Today, there are <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://coinatmradar.com/"">329 of them</a>.</p> \n<p><span>If these devices continue to proliferate, they could become a useful alternative to conventional money-transfer services. Currently, each machine charges a transaction fee of around 3 percent, so the total cost of transferring money from one Bitcoin ATM to another is around 6 percent. That's comparable to the fees charged by incumbent money transfer services, and competition is likely to push down Bitcoin ATM fees over time.</span></p> \n<p>A more ambitious application for Bitcoin would be as an alternative to credit cards for daily purchases. Startups such Bitpay have already figured out how to make Bitcoin attractive to merchants as a way of accepting payments. Credit card networks charge merchants around 3 percent to process transactions. Bitpay charges 1 percent or less to accept Bitcoin payments on behalf of merchants. Bitpay merchants don't have to worry about the headache of disputed payments known as ""chargebacks.""</p> \n<p><span>Of course, for Bitcoin to take off as an alternative to credit cards, consumers will have to start using them regularly. And that's going to be a hard sell, especially if consumers are exposed to the risk of Bitcoin's volatility.</span></p> \n<p>But a Bitcoin-based payment app could also have some advantages. One is security. The current credit card network essentially works on the honor system, allowing any merchant to charge a credit card and relying on after-the-fact adjudication to police fraud. Bitcoin could allow companies to experiment with alternative approaches that build in security at the front end, for example by asking users to confirm a transaction on their smartphones before it's approved. That could cut fraud, reducing the hassle of disputing fraudulent payments and allowing lower fees.</p> \n<p>Moreover, Bitcoin is such a good deal for merchants that they may find it worthwhile to offer their customers discounts for paying with Bitcoin instead of cash or credit cards. That might entice bargain-hunting consumers who aren't otherwise interested in trying a new payment technology.</p> \n<p><img src=""http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/assets/4215267/6355318323_4c41d3ef76_b.jpg"" class=""photo"" alt=""6355318323_4c41d3ef76_b""></p> \n<p class=""caption""><a href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/68751915@N05/6355318323/sizes/l"" style=""font-size: 12px; font-style: italic; line-height: 15px;"">401(K) 2013</a></p> \n<h3><span>Using Bitcoin-the-network without Bitcoin-the-currency</span></h3> \n<p>The biggest stumbling block for many Bitcoin services is Bitcoin's volatility. The current generation of Bitcoin ""wallet"" apps, which store bitcoins on behalf of users, expose consumers to fluctuations in Bitcoin's value. Ordinary consumers are unlikely to ever be comfortable with a payment system where their wealth can shrink by 10 percent or more in a single day.</p> \n<p>Fortunately, it's possible to design Bitcoin-based financial services that don't expose users to fluctuations in Bitcoin's value. Bitpay is a good example. Bitpay merchants set prices in conventional currencies such as the dollar, converting to the equivalent number of Bitcoins at the time of sale. Once the sale is made, Bitpay immediately converts it to an equivalent number of dollars and deposits the cash in the merchant's conventional bank account. This means that from the merchant's perspective, Bitpay is just another way of accepting dollars. A Bitpay merchant isn't affected at all by fluctuations in the value of Bitcoin.</p> \n<p>The same principle could apply to any other Bitcoin-based service. A consumer-friendly payments app could store a user's cash in dollars, converting them to bitcoins at the time of payment. Under the hood the app could use the full power of the Bitcoin platform, but from the user's perspective it would just seem like another way of paying for things with dollars.</p> \n<p>You're probably wondering: if Bitcoin's value is as a payment network, why not just build an open payment network based on a conventional currency like the dollar? An open, dollar-based payment network would be a great idea. The problem is that no one has figured out how to build one.</p> \n<p>Dollars in the Paypal network are worth a dollar because the Paypal company has promised to honor withdrawal requests. But there's no organization to perform this role on a peer-to-peer network like Bitcoin.</p> \n<p>Suppose there were a network called Dollarcoin that worked exactly like Bitcoin except a company called Dollarcoin Inc. promised to convert dollarcoins into dollars. Then the value of one dollarcoin would always equal one dollar. But as the manager of the Dollarcoin network, the Dollarcoin company would face pressure to comply with a variety of laws regarding fraud, money laundering, and so forth. To keep the costs of complying with those requirements under control, it would be forced to regulate who could use the network and how. (Indeed, that's exactly what <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/The-PayPal-Wars-Battles-Planet/dp/1936488590"">happened to Paypal</a> 15 years ago.) Over time, the Dollarcoin network could become as restrictive as conventional financial networks.</p> \n<p>Bitcoin's openness depends on the fact that no one owns the network. And with no owner, there's no one to guarantee that bitcoins have a predictable value.</p> \n<p>Many of Bitcoin's early adopters were acolytes of Ron Paul's brand of hard-money libertarianism. They were attracted to the promise of a currency whose supply was outside of state control, and as a consequence, Bitcoin has gained a reputation as the second coming of the gold standard. That, in turn, has made mainstream economists who are hostile to Ron Paul and the gold standard hostile to Bitcoin.</p> \n<p>But in reality, the case for Bitcoin simply doesn't have much to do with its unorthodox monetary policy. Bitcoin is a payment network that happens to have its own currency, not the other way around. It's worth taking seriously whether or not you agree with Ron Paul's views on the Federal Reserve.</p>",Business & Finance
9 charts that explain the history of global wealth,http://www.vox.com/2014/4/10/5561608/9-charts-that-explain-the-history-of-global-wealth,These nine charts from Thomas Piketty's new book depict the history of wealth accumulation over the long term.,"<p>Thomas Piketty's book <i>Capital in the 21st Century</i> advances an important and provocative argument about the future of the world economy. <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/4/8/5592198/the-short-guide-to-capital-in-the-21st-century"">You can read all about it here in our short guide to the book</a>. But the argument <span class=""GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark"">is built</span> upon the most impressive set of data ever assembled about the history of wealth around the world, and that data <span class=""GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark"">tells</span> many stories beyond the main narrative argument of the book. Here we present nine charts drawn from the book that illustrate the history of the global economy.</p> \n<h3><span>1) The fall and rise of Asia</span></h3> \n<p><img src=""http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/assets/4204525/World_Output.png"" class=""photo"" alt=""World_output"">300 years ago, a majority of the world's economic output was located on the Asian continent. But with the coming of the Industrial Revolution, Europe's share of the global economy increased substantially. As European settled the Western Hemisphere and brought industrial economics with them, the Americas rose as well. Asia's share of world output shrunk massively, despite the continent's enormous population. But over the past 20-30 years, Asia's staged a massive comeback. Its share of world output isn't yet back to where it was in 1714 but it's getting close.</p> \n<h3><span>2) The return of inequality in Britain</span></h3> \n<p><img src=""http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/assets/4204533/capital_in_britain.png"" class=""photo"" alt=""Capital_in_britain"">This chart shows the extent and nature of British wealth as compared to British income. In the 18th and 19th centuries, <span class=""GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark"">wealth</span> was massive relative to income and much of it took the form of agricultural land. Over the course of the 19th century, the relative value of agricultural land shrunk and was largely replaced by ""net foreign capital,"" i.e. British ownership of foreign assets during the heyday of the British Empire. Then came the world wars. The foreign capital was liquidated to pay for the wars, and domestic capital shrunk. Circa 1950 the power of accumulated wealth versus ongoing income reached a low point. But since 1970, wealth has made a comeback, powered considerably by an increase in the value of houses—primarily urban and suburban land in the London area.</p> \n<h3><span>3) The return of inequality in Germany</span></h3> \n<p><img src=""http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/assets/4204565/capital_in_germany.png"" class=""photo"" alt=""Capital_in_germany"">The story of German wealth is different from the British story in almost every detail. ""Net foreign capital,"" meaning German ownership of foreign assets, was not very important in the pre-World War I era. <span class=""GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark"">Instead wealth</span> was driven overwhelmingly by ""other domestic capital,"" meaning the value of German industrial and commercial enterprises. German wealth was, of course, massively destroyed by the world wars. But it's rebounded strongly since its low point. Interesting, despite Germany's vaunted industrial capabilities the rebound has <i>not</i> been driven by a large increase in domestic capital. Instead the key sectors are domestic housing and ownership of foreign assets.</p> \n<h3><span>4) America's age of equality</span></h3> \n<p><img src=""http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/assets/4204589/Capital_in_the_United_States.png"" class=""photo"" alt=""Capital_in_the_united_states"">American economic history looks very different from Britain or Germany. We apparently enjoyed an edenic early period prior to 1880 in which accumulated wealth was small relative to ongoing income. This was a world in which a few years of hard work could, it seems, easily help you stack up against the might of the already wealthy. Many of America's enduring narratives about itself clearly owe a debt to this early period, even though the more recent trajectory has been different.</p> \n<h3> \n<div id=""slaves""><span>5) The fall of the slaveholding aristocracy</span></div> \n</h3> \n<p><img src=""http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/assets/4204611/United_States_With_Slavery.png"" class=""photo"" alt=""United_states_with_slavery""></p> \n<p>The image of early 19th century America has a relatively egalitarian landscape turns out to neglect something important: slavery. Millions of people of African ancestry were held in bondage, making the idea of hard work as the ticket to success a joke. And possession of their labor was extremely valuable. As this chart illustrates, slave wealth was slightly more valuable than all the agricultural land in the country put together. It was also more valuable than all the factories and railroads and canals combined. In a world of relatively abundant land and high wages, owning black people was <i>the</i> key to wealth. And the process of emancipation was possibly the single greatest expropriation of wealth in human history.</p> \n<h3><span>6) The varieties of capitalism</span></h3> \n<p><img src=""http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/assets/4204627/market_value_and_book_value.png"" class=""photo"" alt=""Market_value_and_book_value"">This chart is a little difficult to understand, but it's very deep. For several different countries, it compares the ""market value"" of their companies (i.e., what it would cost to buy all the shares of their stock) to the ""book value"" of the companies (i.e., the value of the factories, patents, offices, etc. that the companies own). This lets us see that in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom share prices are high relative to the book value of companies. The Anglophone countries have shareholder-friendly legal systems in which the owners of stock control enterprises. In Germany, stocks are much less valuable because the legal system gives much more weight to the interests of employees and other stakeholders. France is an intermediate case. These different conceptions of capitalism coexist with vast sums of wealth at stake in the difference between them.</p> \n<h3><span>7) The really really rich are different from you and me</span></h3> \n<p><img src=""http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/assets/4204659/income_composition.png"" class=""photo"" alt=""Income_composition"">This chart shows that the vast majority of people in the top 10 percent of the American income distribution earn a living the way most of us do — they work for it. But among the top 0.1 percent and the top 0.01 percent things are different. Labor income — wages and salaries — are a distinct minority of total earnings. The truly rich don't get their money by working for high pay. They get their money as a consequence of their pre-existing wealth.</p> \n<h3><span>8) Wealth is much more unequal than income</span></h3> \n<p><img src=""http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/assets/4207471/wealth_inequality.png"" class=""photo"" alt=""Wealth_inequality"">You hear a lot about income inequality, but as this chart makes clear wealth inequality is <i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i>much </i>more severe. In the United States, just 1 percent of the population owns about 35 percent of all the wealth. Even in relatively egalitarian Europe, the top 1 percent owns around 25 percent of the wealth. In both continents, the top 10 percent owns over half the wealth. Near the bottom of the spectrum, wealth is typically negative as people have more in debt (whether because of student loans, credit cards, or underwater mortgages) than they have in assets.</p> \n<h3><span>9) The billionaires boom</span></h3> \n<p><img src=""http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/assets/4207487/billionaires.png"" class=""photo"" alt=""Billionaires""></p> \n<p>We are living through a golden age of billionaires. In 1996 there were about 400 billionaires. That number has more than tripled. But the total wealth under the control of billionaires has grown even faster — over five-fold in less than two decades. The trend reflects both growing inequality in rich countries, and growing prosperity in China and other relatively poor ones. The point here is that not only is wealth held unequally, the inequality appears to be growing fractally with the very richest of the rich growing richer at the fastest pace.</p>",Business & Finance
3 ways companies are going about hiring all wrong,http://www.vox.com/2014/4/9/5594194/were-doing-job-interviews-all-wrong,"American employers might be getting many aspects of the job interview all wrong, from the questions they ask to the number of interviewers asking them.","<p>For many American job-seekers, the basic steps of applying for work look roughly the same: you find the posting, write the cover letter, tweak the resume, email the PDFs (not Word documents — good heavens, never Word documents), and if you're lucky, you get a phone interview.</p> \n<p>And then maybe you interview in person, and then maybe again. And maybe it's three or four interviews in a row, possibly with a panel of interviewers, and you maintain a stiff, pleasant smile through the whole ordeal. <span>It's exhausting, and it also might be exactly the wrong way for firms to screen job candidates, for a few reasons.</span></p> \n<h3>More interviews means worse interviewers</h3> \n<p>One piece of evidence is a recent study published in the <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0148296314001003"">Journal of Business Research</a> that finds doing just one interview per candidate is often better than more (and is almost always better than two).</p> \n<p>The reason is deceptively simple. Assuming the firm knows its employees well and puts in enough effort on hiring, it would choose someone relatively experienced and who knows the company well to interview new candidates — maybe someone who has picked good workers in the past.</p> \n<p>Let's call this relatively experienced person Katie, and let's assume she has the best track record at her company of picking good candidates. <span>If Katie gets to pick 10 people out of a pool of 100 applicants, and there are 10 top candidates, or ""targets,"" in that pool, she might be good enough to pick eight of the 10. In the study's terminology, eight out of 10 is Katie's ""hit rate."" Adding anyone else will, on average, shrink down the hit rate, because she's the best interviewer around; a second interviewer would be more limiting than helpful.</span></p> \n<p>Even if the second interviewer were specifically trained to correct for Katie's misses and picked up the two people Katie missed, it would tend to result in a lower hit rate than Katie's alone. This is because the second interviewer would have been trained to be Katie's complement — that's different from being all-around better at picking targets than she is.</p> \n<p>""Adding more interviewers under various conditions will not help you,"" says Mario Fific, an assistant professor of psychology at Grand Valley State University and one of the study's authors. <span>""In most cases, a second interviewer would not improve the decision-making ability of the first interviewer.""</span></p> \n<p>The trick, of course, is in firms finding those good interviewers. But once that master interviewer is identified, a firm may have to add far more interviewers into the mix in order to improve over just that one interviewer alone. If Katie is moderately good, it could take four or more interviewers to surpass her hit rate, and if she's a strong interviewer, the panel might have to be as big as 10. <span>And even then, it depends who those 10 people are; a more diverse group will do a better job than a more uniform group.</span></p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""center""><span>""W</span><span>e are seeing every single industry become a little unorthodox with their interviewing practices""</span></q></p> \n<h3>Weird questions can rule out strong candidates</h3> \n<p><span>Whether it's because of multiple interviews or just lengthy deliberations, it appears the job search got longer over time. As of 2009, survey respondents on the jobs site Glassdoor.com said their average job application and interview process was 12 days from start to finish. As of 2013, that was up to 23. These are online responses from an unscientific survey, meaning they are not perfectly reliable and don't reflect society at large, but the big jump does suggest that many employers really started taking their time with finding new workers. And other data show that job openings are remaining vacant for an </span><a href=""http://dicehiringindicators.com/"" target=""_blank"">unusually long</a><span> period of time.</span></p> \n<p>It's not just multiple interviews extending that hiring time; it's all sorts of new tactics employers are using to try to single out the best workers.</p> \n<p><span>""They're doing the initial phone interview, group interviews, personality tests, they're doing taste-based tests,"" says </span><span>Scott Dobro</span><span>ski, community expert at jobs site Glassdoor.com. ""W</span><span>e are seeing every single industry become a little unorthodox with their interviewing practices.""</span></p> \n<p>One area where employers are increasingly getting unorthodox is interview questions. Firms are going beyond <span>old saws like ""What is your greatest weakness?"" to questions that can verge anywhere from deep to downright silly. ""What is your least favorite thing about humanity?"" is an interview question that medical scheduling company ZocDoc has used, according to </span><a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.glassdoor.com/Top-25-Oddball-Interview-Questions-LST_KQ0,34.htm"">Glassdoor</a><span>. ""Do you believe in Bigfoot?"" has been used at Norwegian Cruise Lines. </span></p> \n<p>But do they work? Those sorts of questions can help an employer tease out the true personality of a candidate who might otherwise give bland, canned answers. And as <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2014/01/15/262789258/episode-509-will-a-computer-decide-whether-you-get-your-next-job"">NPR's Planet Money</a> recently reported, unorthodox tests and questions can help determine whether a candidate would do well in a particularly demanding or emotionally taxing job, like working with angry customers at a call center.</p> \n<p>But as far as upping the ""hit rate"" goes, subjective questions — particularly in areas like personality tests — can be limiting, particularly if a company is looking for a very particular answer, says one hiring expert.</p> \n<p>""There are some companies that do that specifically until they find someone that fits the mold in which they've chosen,"" says Peter McChesney, co-principal and vice president at Palmer Legal Staffing in Washington, DC. ""I<span> think they overlook really strong candidates. and those things are not perfect.""</span></p> \n<h3>Firms pay big money to headhunters ... and then second-guess them</h3> \n<p>McChesney's firm specializes in finding office support, legal, and management candidates for firms in the area. <span>After screening and interviewing candidates, his firm will often pass those people's resumes on to employers. And after 17 years in the hiring business, McChesney says he has seen firms inadvertently throw away candidates his firm has already interviewed and deemed excellent because those firms found something they didn't like on a resume.</span></p> \n<p>""They won't even see the candidate, and it's based just on the piece of paper we've sent them,"" he says. ""Whereas we've already vetted [the candidates].""</p> \n<p>That points to the kind of uncertainty inherent in the hiring process. The way he sees it, it makes no sense for an employer to pay his firm lots of money to seek out candidates, only to second-guess the firm's decisions after all that vetting based on one page. That employer, of course, has its own particular views about what it wants, even if it has hired someone to help them staff up.</p> \n<p>This is why McChesney thinks the wave of the future is in video resumes, which give an employer can get a quick snapshot of the type of person behind a resume.</p> \n<p>""I believe that over time you will see people that send their resume with a video. It's something that we're looking into doing, and that is looking at giving a snapshot video with resumes, because then you are seeing someone,"" he says.</p> \n<p>So what's a firm to do, aside from asking for Youtube clips? One of the biggest is to be totally candid with potential hires. A<span>ccording to another Glassdoor survey, </span><a href=""http://employers.glassdoor.com/blog/6-in-10-employees-say-job-realities-different-than-expected-glassdoor-survey/"" target=""_blank"">61 percent of employees</a><span> said their jobs didn't fit the expectations set up during the interview process. Morale and job responsibilities led the list. According to Dobroski, sending in trusted workers and not bosses to answer interviewees' questions about the firm truthfully (but perhaps with a positive spin) is one fix for this problem.</span></p> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""3399958"" alt=""unemployed per job opening"" src=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3399958/Screen_Shot_2015-02-11_at_2.53.23_PM.0.png""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">(<a href=""http://www.bls.gov/web/jolts/jlt_labstatgraphs.pdf"" target=""_blank"">Labor Department</a>)</p> \n<p><span>Employers may want to up their hiring game soon.

"The Dow topped 18,000 today. Learn why that matters.",http://www.vox.com/2014/4/10/5595258/the-normal-persons-guide-to-the-stock-market,Everything you need to know about the very basics of the US stock market,"<p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average topped 18,000 for the first time ever on Tuesday. The Dow has been on a tear the last few days, after its nearly 1,000-point <a href=""https://www.google.com/finance?cid=983582"" target=""_blank"">plummet</a> earlier this month but the latest great news about GDP growth was what put it over the top.</p> \n<p>The latest market milestone of course is reason to cheer, but to people who don't pay close attention to economics or finance, it can be hard to know exactly why a soaring stock market is good news. So this is an explainer of the most basic kind, for anyone who wants to know exactly what the stock market is and why it's so important.</p> \n<h3><span>What is stock?</span></h3> \n<p>Stock is a share of a company. Shares of stock are also sometimes called equity. When you own stock, you own a little piece of a company and become what is called a shareholder. You also usually have a (very small) say in how the company is run and get to vote on important company matters like members of the board of directors.</p> \n<p>Owning stock means you have claim to a share of a company's assets and earnings. <span>A stock's value is measured in points, which are the same thing as dollars. When General Motors is at 33.9 points, that means it costs $33.90 to buy one share of GM stock.</span><span> </span></p> \n<h3><span>Why do companies sell stock?</span></h3> \n<p><span></span><span>There are two reasons companies sell stock. One is that it's a way for a company to get cash so it can do things like expand or buy new equipment. The other way a company can do this is by borrowing money. Each of these options has costs and benefits. Borrowing money means paying interest, but selling new shares of stock means reducing the value of the shares owned by the existing shareholders. What's more, in order to be able to issue stock at all you first need to stage an initial public offering (IPO), which leaves you subject to extra regulation.</span></p> \n<p><q class=""left"" aria-hidden=""true"">Mark zuckerberg's facebook shares were valuable before the company went public, but he couldn't easily sell them.</q></p> \n<p style=""font-family: 'Alright Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 22.5px;"">The other reason to sell stock — especially at the IPO phase — is that it lets people who own lots of shares sell them to someone else in order to get money. Mark Zuckerberg's Facebook shares were incredibly valuable even before Facebook became a publicly traded company, but there was no practical way for him to sell them without holding an IPO and putting Facebook shares on the stock market.</p> \n<h3>What is the stock market?</h3> \n<p>The stock market is the big arena in which people trade those shares of different companies. The actual places where stocks are bought and sold are called exchanges. The two main stock exchanges in the US are the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and the Nasdaq.</p> \n<p>Both are based in New York, though only the NYSE has a physical location on Wall Street. The NYSE trading floor is the backdrop to those emblematic shots of brokers yelling and making hand signals at each other. The Nasdaq, meanwhile, is an electronic exchange. <span>Both exchanges open at 9:30 AM Eastern every morning and close at 4 PM every afternoon. Over time the physical exchanges have become less important since computers have taken over more and more of the trading.</span></p> \n<h3><span>Which number should I watch to tell where the stock market is going?</span></h3> \n<p><span></span></p> \n<p>There are a few numbers you can watch. Though there are several stock indexes, the big three are the Dow Jones Industrial Average (known as ""the Dow""), <span>Standard &amp; Poor's 500 (or ""the S&amp;P""), and Nasdaq — which, confusingly, shares its name with the stock exchange.</span></p> \n<p><img alt=""Screen_shot_2014-04-10_at_11"" class=""photo"" src=""http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/assets/4272553/Screen_Shot_2014-04-10_at_11.41.11_AM.png""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">A look at 25 years of S&amp;P 500 peaks and valleys.</p> \n<p><span>These are all stock indexes: numbers that </span><span>track a whole bunch of stocks at once. </span><span>The Dow tracks the prices of 30 stocks that represent a broad range of major companies in all industries except transportation and utilities. The S&amp;P 500, as the name suggests, tracks 500 major companies that are intended to be representative of the US economy. The Nasdaq includes thousands of companies that are traded in the Nasdaq exchange. The Nasdaq and S&amp;P 500 are both weighted by firm size, while the Dow is not. </span><span>Though they are calculated differently and can have differing day to day shifts, all of these big three tend to track together, broadly speaking.</span></p> \n<p>All of these indexes are measured in ""points,"" like individual stocks, but because of the ways they are calculated, it doesn't make sense to talk about them in terms of dollars the way it does for individual stocks. However, because they are based on stock prices, they all are subject to inflation.</p> \n<p>You can find data on them in many places — often TV news networks will track at least one major index on a ticker in one corner of the screen. But you can also track them in real time via sites like <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.google.com/finance"">Google</a>, <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://finance.yahoo.com/"">Yahoo Finance</a>, and <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.bloomberg.com/markets/"">Bloomberg</a>.</p> \n<h3>What makes the stock market go up and down?</h3> \n<p>Good economic news can boost stock indexes, and bad economic news can tank them. This is why after major economic releases, like jobs reports or GDP reports, stock indexes will sometimes post big jumps or declines. When the economy is growing, that is taken as a sign that the businesses in that economy are also growing. Likewise, a good job market is a sign of healthy businesses that have both the money and the need to hire, and that consumers will also have more money to spend.</p> \n<p>News from the Federal Reserve, the nation's central bank, also tends to affect stocks. When the Fed pushes interest rates lower, it means it is trying to boost the economy by encouraging more borrowing. Seeing this stimulus can excite stock markets. Likewise, a Fed trying to cool the economy down by raising interest rates can send stocks tumbling. So when a Fed official even hints at what the Fed might do in the future, stocks can swing wildly.</p> \n<p>The Fed can also affect the returns on investments like US treasuries — issuances of government debt — through its purchases. If the fed lowers the yield on treasuries, it can send investors looking for better returns in the stock market than they can find in a treasury.</p> \n<p>Major international events can also send the stock market tumbling. Markets tend to get anxious when the potential for major international conflict can cause all sorts of disruptions, like hurting global trade. Markets were shaky, for example, when the unrest in Crimea recently began heating up.</p> \n<p><img src=""http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/assets/4272571/52014016.jpg"" class=""photo"" alt=""52014016""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">The 1987 stock market crash created chaos on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange.</p> \n<h3>Should I care when the news tells me the stock market had a bad day?</h3> \n<p>A stock market's day to day swings mostly act as a barometer for the broader economy. When the stock market jumps or falls by a lot, the culprit could be any of the things listed above, like a great or awful economic report.</p> \n<p><q class=""right"" aria-hidden=""true"">it's important not to read too much into any one day's stock market swings.</q></p> \n<p>The stock market also sometimes acts in completely mysterious ways. There was<span> an </span><a href=""http://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/feds/2007/200713/200713pap.pdf"" style=""background-color: #ffffff; line-height: 1.5;"">enormous stock market crash in 1987</a><span> whose causes remain controversial today, and that was quickly reversed. It's important not to read too much into any one day's swings. Several days or even weeks of really great or ugly stock market readings taken together are a more meaningful indicator that some sort of a shift is happening. Of course, if you own lots of stock (or even a little) you should care at least a little about money you're making or losing.</span></p> \n<p>It's important to know what you're looking at when you're reading any given stock index. All of these big indexes mentioned above are on different scales. For example, around the same time the Dow first closed above 16,000 points for the first time, in November 2013, the S&amp;P was just inching above 1,800. That's why it's perhaps smarter to keep an eye on percentages when monitoring day to day shifts in the stock market — 100 points on the S&amp;P 500 is way more than 100 points on the Dow.</p> \n<p>Because these indexes are based on individual stock prices, they, too, are subject to inflation. That means when the news says an index breaks a record, it may not be a real record.</p> \n<h3></h3> \n<h3>Should I own stock?</h3> \n<p style=""font-family: 'Alright Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 22.5px;"">That depends on how much you're OK with taking a risk. Broadly speaking, stocks are more risky than a lot of other investments. Treasuries and savings accounts are among the safest bets of them all, but they also don't generally bring about the same kind of reward as stocks. With stocks, there is no interest rate continually pushing your investment higher, and it's much easier to lose money. But with risk comes reward. It's hard to lose money in a savings account, but you also only earn a little. Meanwhile, the average return on the S&amp;P 500 from 2004 to 2013 was a little over 7 percent, according to <a href=""http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/datafile/histretSP.html"" target=""_blank"" style=""background-color: #ffffff;"">calculations</a> from the Stern School of Business at NYU.</p> \n<p style=""font-family: 'Alright Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 22.5px;"">If you have a 401(k) or some other sort of retirement plan, you already have a very easy path to owning stock, and there's a good chance you have some already. Lots of retirement plans allow you to invest via instruments like target date funds and index funds. These funds are big mixes of investments like stocks, bonds, and US treasuries. Because they're diverse, they're generally less risky than owning just one or two stocks alone.</p> \n<h3>How do I buy stock?</h3> \n<p>Though you can buy stock directly from some companies, almost all stock transactions are done through third-party brokers. But you have a lot of options for brokers, whether in-person or online though a service like Etrade or TD Ameritrade. That said, some companies offer direct stock purchase plans, which allow you to buy stocks directly from a firm. The advantage of these is that you don't have to pay big broker fees or give anyone a commission on your earnings. The disadvantage is lack of flexibility — under one of these plans, you can only buy or sell one stock. And owning one stock means you're subject to whatever problems befall that one company.</p> \n<h3>Can I buy stock in any company?</h3> \n<p>No. A company has to have made its shares publicly available in the stock market. When a company decides to jump into the market, it has an IPO. This is what is known as ""going public."" <a href=""http://investing.businessweek.com/research/common/symbollookup/symbollookup.asp"" target=""_blank"">This directory</a> from Bloomberg Businessweek is a good place to find out if a company is public.</p> \n<h3>What makes my company's stock go up and down?</h3> \n<p>There are a few factors, but the major one is a company's profits. Public companies report their earnings quarterly, and stocks take their cues from these reports.</p> \n<p>But in between those reports, the business news drives stock prices. <span>After September 11, airline stocks plummeted as investors guessed flying might not be a great business in the near future. Likewise, bad news about a company's products, like a massive recall, can pull a stock's price down.</span></p> \n<p>Another factor is simply how promising a company looks. A company can be wildly successful without posting big profits, as Amazon has proven. That company has always taken a long view of success, investing its money in big projects like a grocery delivery service, and investors have thus far rewarded it, despite relatively low profits.</p> \n<p>Take the value of all the outstanding shares of stock and add them all together and you have a measure of the company's size, in a figure that is known as the ""market capitalization"" or ""market cap"" for short. When one public company is said to be bigger or smaller than another, those are comparisons of market cap figures.</p> \n<h3>What's insider trading? Should I do it?</h3> \n<p><span>That depends. As the </span><a href=""https://www.sec.gov/answers/insider.htm"" target=""_blank"">SEC explains</a><span>, insiders like corporate executives, officers, employees, and board members can all trade their company's stock. That is technically insider trading and is legal, but they must also report all of those trades to the SEC. So if you fall into this category, then by all means: insider-trade away! (But there is a lot of paperwork you need to fill out; if you're in this position you're probably rich and should hire a lawyer.)</span></p> \n<p>But be careful, because this sort of trading can easily slip into illegal territory. This better-known kind of insider trading — the kind that's often mentioned in news clips of well-heeled types heading off to court hearings or prison — has to do with inside information.</p> \n<p>When someone with non-public knowledge of developments within a company uses that information to drive their trades, that is illegal. This can involve a company's insiders themselves or anyone else who might be privy to that information: employees' family and friends, workers at brokerage firms who deal with the company, and even members of Congress. This is why hedge fund SAC Capital has recently been in <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2014-03-13/steven-cohen-identified-in-new-insider-trading-suit"">all sorts of trouble</a>.</p> \n<h3><span>What's high frequency trading? Should I do it?</span></h3> \n<p>Probably not, given that this a guide to the stock market for the average, everyday person. Average, everyday people do not engage in high-frequency trading (HFT). The topic was hot this year in part due to the book ""Flash Boys"" from Michael Lewis. HFT involves the use of sophisticated computer algorithms to execute trades in fractions of a second. HFT can bring huge profits because these traders have the kind of speed that many investors don't, but some say these traders are gaming the market.</p> \n<p>So if you have the equipment and are good at it, it could bring you some huge profits. If not, it might not be the easiest line of work to get into.</p>",Business & Finance
How Dove went from moisturizing to patronizing,http://www.vox.com/2014/4/25/5652462/how-dove-went-from-a-soap-to-a-brand-feminists-love-to-hate,A Harvard Business School case study tells about how Dove went from a way to get clean to a way to feel great about your imperfect body,"<p>It can be hard to remember, but at one point, Dove just sold soap.

It's not exactly that Dove suddenly cared about women crafting healthy body images. Rather, that new branding was part of a corporation-wide growth strategy to give brands distinct identities, rather than having them simply stand for products,</p> \n<p>In 2000, Dove parent company Unilever crafted a strategy plan called the ""Path to Growth,"" in which it cut down 1,600 brands to 400, according to a <a href=""http://hbr.org/product/dove-evolution-of-a-brand/an/508047-PDF-ENG"" target=""_blank"">2007 Harvard Business School case study</a> from HBS Professor John Deighton. <span>A few of the lucky surviving labels were selected to be what are called ""Masterbrands"" — brands that were ""mandated to serve as umbrella identities over a range of product forms,"" as Deighton puts it.

And that jump into lotion and hair mousse is why Dove became synonymous with ""real"" women posing in their undies.</p> \n<p>No longer could Dove simply advertise itself as the best moisturizing soap on the market. And instead of trying to craft a complicated brand image that simultaneously made the company appear to be the best at hair care, skin care, and controlling body odor, Unilever decided to take a different tack.</p> \n<p>""Unilever decided, instead, that Dove should stand for a point of view,"" Deighton writes.</p> \n<p>All that was left to do was figure out what, exactly, Dove's point of view would be. Dove's global brand director, Silvia Lagnado, found it when her research found that women worldwide were discontent with the way ""young, white, blonde, and thin"" were constantly equated with beauty. After consulting with leading experts in psychiatry and women's views of beauty, Dove honed its message and found a new niche: advertising to ""real women.""

In the sketches ad, <a href=""http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/eat-the-damn-cake/201304/whats-wrong-doves-real-beauty-sketches-campaign"" target=""_blank"">others have argued</a>, it's clear that the (mostly white and slender) women subjects equate beauty with being even more slender, not to mention younger.</p> \n<p><span>Some (</span><a style=""background-color: #ffffff; line-height: 1.5;"" href=""http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2013/04/18/unilever-faces-criticism-for-real-beauty-ad-campaign"" target=""_blank"">myself included</a><span>) also pointed out that Unilever is selling ""real beauty"" even while it sells products like Slim-Fast and Axe, a line whose identity is in part built on the idea that </span><a style=""background-color: #ffffff; line-height: 1.5;"" href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9tWZB7OUSU"" target=""_blank"">body spray is irresistible</a><span> to well-endowed, bikini-clad women. </span><span>As a result of the earnest ad, parodies sprang up, including a </span><a style=""background-color: #ffffff; line-height: 1.5;"" href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8Jiwo3u6Vo"" target=""_blank"">simple gender-reversal take</a><span>, as well as a </span><a style=""background-color: #ffffff; line-height: 1.5;"" href=""http://www.collegehumor.com/embed/6887343/dove-real-beauty-balls-parody"" target=""_blank"">hilariously NSFW</a><span> remake. </span></p> \n<p><span>The backlash to the company's ""beauty patch"" ad has been quick and harsh. Though Dove appears to have gone for a more diverse crowd this time around, critics have found many other weaknesses. </span><a href=""http://nymag.com/thecut/2014/04/this-dove-ad-is-garbage.html"" target=""_blank"">New York Magazine</a><span> called it ""garbage,"" lambasting Dove for making women seem ""dumb"" by duping them with a faux scientific study (and by showing them laugh, not rage, in response). Fast Company called the ad </span><a href=""http://www.fastcompany.com/3029486/the-recommender/this-real-beauty-parody-featuring-gorillas-shows-how-condescending-dove-is-t"" target=""_blank"">""condescending,""</a><span> instead recommending a (pretty funny) parody ad. </span></p> \n<p>Dove, of course, isn't the only company that has taken criticism for selling products by using a woman-friendly message. Pantene's ""Labels Against Women"" ad suffered <a href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/feminist-pantene-ad-is-pandering-2013-12"" target=""_blank"">similar blowback</a> from consumers who saw it as manipulative. And Goldieblox, a toy company that says it sells <a href=""http://www.goldieblox.com/"" target=""_blank"">""engineering toys for girls,""</a> likewise raised questions about the <a href=""http://www.slate.com/blogs/xx_factor/2013/11/26/goldieblox_disrupting_the_pink_aisle_or_just_selling_toys.html"" target=""_blank"">ethics of selling feminism</a>.</p> \n<p>For his part, Deighton doesn't believe Dove has overplayed the real beauty hand just yet. To him, the ads are ""sanctimonious and lachrymose, yes, and eventually it will wear out, but I see no evidence that we've reached that point,"" he says in an email.</p> \n<p><span>Once that point is reached, however, the question for Dove may soon be what sort of new ""point of view"" it wants to sell (alongside soap and lotion).</span></p>",Business & Finance

In a <a href=""http://www.nber.org/papers/w20137"" target=""_blank"" style=""line-height: 1.5; background-color: #ffffff;"">working paper</a> released earlier this year by the NBER, North Carolina State's Robert Clark, George Washington University's Annamaria Lusardi, and the University of Pennsylvania's Olivia Mitchell found a correlation between people's scores on this test and how well their 401(k)s perform.</p> \n<p>They examined data on employees of a large financial institution with more than 20,000 employees. The researchers sent them a survey asking five questions about finance and got nearly 2,800 responses:</p> \n<p>Respondents' abilities to answer those five questions turned out to be significantly linked to how well their 401(k)s performed. <span>The most knowledgeable participants also tended to have 401(k) returns that were 1.3 percentage points higher than their least knowledgeable peers, a statistically significant difference. </span></p> \n<p><span>People who got 4 or 5 questions right — around two-thirds of respondents — had average returns of 9.5 percent. People who got 0 or 1 questions correct had returns of 8.2 percent.</span></p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""right"">Over 30 years, the smartest investors will have nest eggs 25 percent bigger than their less savvy peers</q></p> \n<p>While 1.3 percent might sound like a small margin, it's a huge difference when you calculate it out over a few decades. The authors figure that after 30 years of working, the most knowledgeable respondents will end up with retirement nest eggs that are 25 percent larger than the least knowledgeable respondents. That can be a huge difference, considering how much money most analysts <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/7/31/5882885/retirement-planning-saving-how-much-do-i-need"" target=""_blank"">recommend</a><b> </b>people save for retirement. These results suggest<b> </b>that if a lower-return person ends up with $600,000, a higher-return person will have $150,000 more by retirement.</p> \n<p>One of the biggest things that put the more knowledgeable people ahead was stock ownership. The highest-return people were more likely to pick stock index funds, while lower scorers chose more conservative (and therefore lower-return) funds.</p> \n<p><span>Of course, the share of people at the bottom of the spectrum was relatively small — just around 5 percent. </span><span>However, </span><span>the people who answered the survey tended to be older, save more, and earn higher returns than those who didn't participate. For this reason, the researchers think respondents are likely more sophisticated than the non-respondents, meaning the study still might underestimate the difference between the most- and least-sophisticated investors. In addition, the respondents work at a large financial institution, which may imply that they have more financial knowledge than your average person.</span></p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""right"">the study highlights one of the biggest weaknesses of the american retirement system</q></p> \n<p>The basic gist is pretty unsurprising: better financial knowledge seems to make for better investments, the authors write. <span>But the study highlights one of the biggest weaknesses of the American retirement system. As pensions disappear, people are encouraged to rely on tax-subsidized 401(k) accounts.

And the </span><span>cost of a machine operating a vehicle will be dramatically cheaper than the cost of a human.</span></p> \n<p><span>The long-distance trucking industry carries </span><a href=""http://selectusa.commerce.gov/industry-snapshots/logistics-and-transportation-industry-united-states"" target=""_blank"">about 68.5 percent</a><span> of all goods shipped in this country, and </span><span>on average, paying drivers accounts for </span><a href=""http://www.ooida.com/EducationTools/Tools/costpermile.asp"" target=""_blank"">30 percent</a><span> of its costs. </span><span>One of the things that drive up the cost of drivers is the fact that long-haul trucking is a much more unpleasant lifestyle than driving a cab. Many drivers spend five or six days a week on the road, which is why trucking has such an extraordinarily high turnover rate: </span><a href=""http://www.truckline.com/article.aspx?uid=407d0a14-e54b-451d-a307-243a231095e0"" target=""_blank"">about 98 percent annually</a><span>.</span></p> \n<p><q class=""right"" aria-hidden=""true"">long-haul trucking has a 98 percent turnover rate annually</q></p> \n<p><span>Obviously, machines won't care about these lifestyle difficulties. In fact, the Australian mining company Rio Tinto has </span><a href=""http://www.itnews.com.au/News/337313,rio-tinto-prepares-to-deploy-more-driverless-trucks.aspx"" target=""_blank"">already begun implementing autonomous trucks</a> at its remote iron ore mines, partly because it's so expensive to get drivers to go live in those places.</p> \n<p><span>Another factor is that u</span><span>nlike for taxis, limits on the number of hours a person can drive also drive up the cost of transport. A trucker can legally only drive for </span><a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/regulations/hours-of-service"">11 out of every 24 hours</a><span>, so shipping something cross-country requires delays for sleeping, or paying two drivers who trade off</span><span>. That won't be the case with driverless trucks, which will also be able to more easily take advantage of traffic-free interstates at night.</span></p> \n<p>Freightliner says its new technology isn't meant to eliminate drivers — it's mainly intended to cut down on driver fatigue, reducing the frequency of accidents. But if it doesn't develop the technology to fully replace drivers, another company will. <span>Eliminating drivers will save </span><span>trucking companies even more money than it will save companies like Uber — eventually reducing the cost of trucked goods.</span></p> \n<h3>2) Driverless technology will be ready for highways before cities</h3> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3674250/9c466105-ea72-498e-8ff7-4f4a25c09001-a2d174aecfac4841a344e7a1ea7e1c06-6b80b84181574cbba7e11775846dd6ba.0.jpeg"" alt=""freightliner"" data-chorus-asset-id=""3674250""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">(<a href=""https://ema.run.cantoflight.com/p/freightlinerinspiration/album/V75D0?from=nav&amp;display=list&amp;column=image&amp;id=de0bggc1at6bn9v12tqo8rem5q"">Freightliner</a>)</p> \n<p>Engineering a vehicle that can drive at a constant speed on a predictable highway is a much simpler problem than designing one that can drive on city streets, which are filled with traffic lights, pedestrians, and other sudden obstacles.</p> \n<p>That's the reason Google began is self-driving car program with experiments on highways. And the vast majority of long-haul truck miles are logged on the interstate system, making it a convenient industry to begin implementing driverless technologies — including some that are already used.</p> \n<p>Though Google's flashy car is getting the most press, you've probably already experienced semi-autonomous driving capabilities that have been rolled out in human-operated cars: things like <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_cruise_control"" target=""_blank"">adaptive cruise control</a> (which can slow you down if there's a car in front of you) and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lane_departure_warning_system"" target=""_blank"">systems that alert you</a> if you begin drifting out of your lane.</p> \n<p>Inspiration's new truck<span> is a combination of these existing technologies, not a fully autonomous vehicle. (The government considers it a </span><a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.nhtsa.gov/About+NHTSA/Press+Releases/U.S.+Department+of+Transportation+Releases+Policy+on+Automated+Vehicle+Development"">level 3 out of 4 on its automation scale</a>, the same as Google's current cars.) But it's an incremental step toward a future truck that might be able to operate without a driver.</p> \n<h3><span>3) Trains of driverless trucks are way more fuel-efficient</span></h3> \n<p><img alt=""12050-008"" class=""photo"" src=""http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/assets/4556503/12050-008.jpg""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">A truck convoy experiment in Sweden.

But computers can do it. Recently, a <a href=""http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20130409-robot-truck-platoons-roll-forward"" target=""_blank"">few different companies</a> have conducted experiments with a lead truck <span>(driven by a human) and other trucks and cars that follow it (each with a human inside, but guided by computers).</span></p> \n<p><a href=""http://www.popsci.com/article/cars/robot-truck-convoy-tested-nevada?src=SOC&amp;dom=tw"" target=""_blank"">Recent tests</a><span> by a US company called </span><a href=""http://www.peloton-tech.com/"" target=""_blank"">Peloton</a> showed that while traveling at 65 miles per hour 36 feet apart, two trucks packed together <a href=""http://www.peloton-tech.com/about/"" target=""_blank"">saved 7 percent on fuel</a>. This was the average for just two trucks (the lead saved 4.5 percent, and the rear saved 10 percent), so it would increase as trains get longer.</p> \n<center> <iframe frameborder=""0"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/24R8E7Uru_4"" height=""360"" width=""640""></iframe> </center> \n<p> </p> \n<p><span>These sorts of trains would also serve as a convenient bridge to eventually eliminating some drivers. </span></p> \n<p><span>Initially, you could have drivers in each truck, like Freightliner is proposing. Later, </span><span>before driverless trucks are ready for city streets,</span><span> </span><span>you could have a driver in just the lead truck, with others waiting to take them over after they exit the interstate. Eventually, you could do away with the humans altogether and save that 30 percent spent on pay.</span></p> \n<h3>What obstacles need to be overcome for driverless trucks</h3> \n<p><img alt=""12050-001"" class=""photo"" src=""http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/assets/4557135/12050-001.jpg""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">(<a target=""_blank"" href=""http://newsroom.scania.com/en-group/2012/04/04/scania-lines-up-for-platooning-trials/"">Scania</a>)</p> \n<p>The factors that block a broad rollout of self-driving trucks fall mainly into two categories.</p> \n<p>One is safety. People are understandably concerned about the idea of computers <span>driving cars around on the roads, and those worries are amplified for tractor-trailers that can weigh up to 80,000 pounds when fully loaded.</span></p> \n<p>But <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.techhive.com/article/2046262/the-first-driverless-cars-will-actually-be-a-bunch-of-trucks.html"">experts actually predict</a><span> that automated systems will make trucking safer by eliminating distracted driving and human error. And G</span><span>oogle's driverless cars, at least, have now </span><span>gone </span><a href=""http://www.reviewjournal.com/life/technology/5-facts-about-google-s-self-driving-cars-and-why-2017-still-reality"" target=""_blank"">more than 700,000 miles</a><span> without an accident. </span></p> \n<p><q class=""right"" aria-hidden=""true"">safety concerns are amplified for tractor-trailers that can weigh up to 80,000 pounds</q></p> \n<p><span>Obviously, their safety </span><span>needs to be proven before these trucks are filling the interstates. But this may be a surmountable concern, especially since the technologies can be implemented incrementally. In a sense, a single driver leading two trucks linked digitally isn't all that different from the drivers that already pull </span><a href=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4094/4914699703_d53c9fb3dd.jpg"" target=""_blank"">two trailers linked physically</a>, and these convoys may gradually get people used to the idea of autonomous trucks.</p> \n<p>The other problem is legal. Right now, <a href=""http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/07/29/states-driverless-cars/2595613/"" target=""_blank"">just a few states</a> (including California, Nevada, and Florida, plus DC) have laws on the books regarding driverless cars, and their legal status as a whole is murky. For driverless trucking on interstates to be practical, all states would need to explicitly allow these vehicles on public roads.</p> \n<p>Advocates are hopeful that national legislation will solve this problem. It's all very uncertain, but in 2012, Google's Sergey Brin predicted the Department of Transportation would begin regulating autonomous vehicles nationally as early as 2017.</p> \n<p>And it seems likely that if self-driving cars were legalized, driverless trucks — which, though heavier, would mostly operate in a simpler, more controlled environment and would be exclusively owned and maintained by professional companies — would be allowed too.</p> \n<p><b>Further reading:</b></p> \n<ul> \n<li><span><a href=""http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2013/11/25/131125fa_fact_bilger?currentPage=all&amp;src=longreads"" target=""_blank"">Burkhard Bilger's deep look</a> at Google's driverless project, part of <a href=""http://blog.longreads.com/post/a-reading-list-for-people-who-never-want-to-drive-again/"" target=""_blank"">Longreads.com's excellent reading list</a> on self-driving cars. </span></li> \n<li> <span>Brad Plumer explains </span><a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/5/28/5756736/the-case-for-self-driving-cars"" target=""_blank"">15 ways self-driving cars will change our lives</a>.</li> \n<li>Timothy B.

These low-skill jobs have made up the bulk of job growth over the last decade or so, as the Dallas Fed showed in a recent paper.</p> \n<p><img alt=""Screen_shot_2014-06-09_at_11.34.18_am"" class=""photo"" src=""http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/assets/4585307/Screen_Shot_2014-06-09_at_11.34.18_AM.png""></p> \n<p>While jobs fall out of the middle, new jobs are created at the top and bottom. And those jobs at the bottom tend to be ""nonroutine manual"" jobs: those that require few skills and little problem-solving. Many of these errand jobs fit this bill perfectly, involving deliveries and other rote tasks.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""center"">One major problem is finding steady work — no grocery run takes eight hours.</q></p> \n<p>These new errand jobs can feature high pay — Instacart, Manjoo noted, can pay $30 an hour. But a major problem is finding steady work — no grocery run takes eight hours.

(That said, TaskRabbit <a href=""http://www.theverge.com/2013/5/23/4352116/taskrabbit-temp-agency-gig-economy"" target=""_blank"">has experimented with</a> making some workers full-time temps.)</p> \n<h3>2. A tough climb up?</h3> \n<p><span>Performing odd jobs also largely means doing work that doesn't boost a person's resume much. It is possible to get work that's more medium-skill on these websites — administrative work or proofreading, for example — and some services, like Washio, do say that some of these workers can after a while get jobs within the company. But many of the errand jobs still involve simply carting goods around or doing other simple manual tasks. </span></p> \n<p><span>Grocery-fetching may be a good way to earn money, but if the wave of the future looks like delivering goods, not to mention renting out rooms on Airbnb and giving people Lyft rides, the question is whether those earners accumulate enough new skills, knowledge, and training to eventually help them find new jobs and, ultimately, boost the economy.</span></p> \n<p><img alt=""142288020"" class=""photo"" src=""http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/assets/4587667/142288020.jpg""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">A TaskRabbit makes a flower delivery to a lucky customer.</p> \n<h3>3.

As <a href=""http://www.theverge.com/2013/5/23/4352116/taskrabbit-temp-agency-gig-economy"" target=""_blank"">The Verge</a> reported in 2013, 70 percent of the company's workers have at least a bachelor's degree. It seems that many people taking these jobs either have fallen on hard times or just want a little money on the side.</p> \n<p>But what may be happening with these new errand services is that those time-strapped, richer Americans who still have jobs have found a way to buy a bit of extra time. And they're buying it from the people who most need jobs — those with no work and lots of time on their hands.</p> \n<p><span>All of these factors combined have made it possible to buy the sort of help that previously would have been out of reach.</span></p> \n<p><span>Though those higher-educated Americans likely to earn far more than their least-educated peers, many don't have the money for a full-time housekeeper. Being able to spend $30 a week to get laundry done, however, is much more doable, and technology has made that transaction possible. Services like Washio and TaskRabbit exploit the intersection of these trends. The rise of errand-service companies may be a classic example of companies popping up that create demand that customers didn't even know they had. The question is how much that demand will translate into a demand for unsteady, low-skill labor.</span></p>",Business & Finance

In addition, the program benefits employers by attracting the kind of high-quality employees who are likely to be drawn to a tuition benefit.</p> \n<p><q class=""right"" aria-hidden=""true"">starbucks' new program isn't about altruism; educational reimbursement can be great for employers</q></p> \n<p>Starbucks is far from the first company to offer a tuition benefit — in fact, the company had, before this program, offered around $1,000 per worker in educational reimbursement. But now they will be spending an unusually large amount on it.</p> \n<p>""It's very generous. Most large organizations will provide tuition reimbursement up to $5,250"" — the line at which the IRS starts taxing the benefits for both the employee and employer, says Bruce Elliott, manager of compensation and benefits at the Society for Human Resource Management.</p> \n<p><span>Around 54 percent of all companies offer some form of educational reimbursement, according to one SHRM survey.</span></p> \n<p>In addition, many companies that offer reimbursement tend to only offer the assistance for programs that will specifically boost their performance at work, as the <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://online.wsj.com/articles/starbucks-to-subsidize-workers-online-degrees-1402876800"">Wall Street Journal reports</a>. Starbucks, meanwhile, will allow employees to choose their programs, which could potentially help them leave the company in the future.</p> \n<p><span></span><span>The Starbucks offer is extended to both part- and full-time employees — anyone who works 20 hours or more per week, and it has no strings attached. Employees who take the company up on the offer are not under any obligation to stay at the company after that.</span></p> \n<p>However, Starbucks' new program isn't about altruism. Research shows educational reimbursement can have big benefits for employers. One reason is taxes. The first $5,250 in tuition benefits <a href=""http://www.irs.com/articles/will-i-be-taxed-employer-tuition-assistance"" target=""_blank"">accrue to workers tax-free</a>, making tuition payments a way to get more bang for your compensation buck.</p> \n<p>But another issue is that different employees will value a tuition benefit differently, and tuition assistance might disproportionately appeal to higher-quality workers. In a <a href=""http://www.nber.org/digest/feb03/w9225.html"" target=""_blank"">2002 NBER working paper</a>, Wharton School of Business Professor Peter Cappelli studied Census data and found that employees who use tuition assistance are more productive than their peers.</p> \n<p>In addition, those extra abilities are not readily visible to most other employers who are competing for talent; the very act of offering tuition assistance draws in people with those higher abilities. An employer doesn't have to go looking for them.</p> \n<p>That's not the only way tuition assistance can sort great employees into a firm. It may also have to do with a worker's ""discount rate"" — that is, how much the employee values a dollar today versus that dollar's payoff in a few years, as University of Minnesota professor Colleen Flaherty-Manchester wrote in a <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://digitalcommons.ilr.cornell.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1998&amp;context=ilrreview"">2012 paper</a>. The sorts of employees who take advantage of tuition assistance are more willing to hold out for that eventual payoff, she writes.</p> \n<p>This benefits a company through employee retention — the workers who take advantage of the degree programs have an added incentive to stick around. This is great for firms, as it can be very expensive to replace an employee: a <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://americanprogress.org/issues/labor/report/2012/11/16/44464/there-are-significant-business-costs-to-replacing-employees/"">2012 assessment</a> from the left-leaning Center for American Progress found that replacement on average costs around 21 percent of a worker's annual salary, though some estimates have ranged above 100 percent.</p> \n<p><q class=""center"" aria-hidden=""true"">""this is really a way to develop their quote-unquote 'farm team' for future roles within the organization""</q></p> \n<p>And the savings will likely come not only from retention but from hiring; expanding the pool of educated Starbucks employees means expanding the pool of promotable Starbucks employees.</p> \n<p>""If you think about it, it's much cheaper to hire from within than it is to hire externally, especially at the management level,"" Elliott says. <span>""This is a way really to develop their quote-unquote 'farm team' for future roles within the organization.""</span></p> \n<p><span>The only downside, he adds, is the potential cost to Starbucks. It's hard to know right now how many workers will take the company up on its offer, but the pool of potential ASU students is large. As CNN reported last year, </span><a target=""_blank"" href=""http://money.cnn.com/2014/06/15/news/economy/starbucks-schultz-education/index.html"">around 70 percent</a><span> o</span><span>f the company's 135,000 store employees don't have undergraduate degrees.</span></p>",Business & Finance

(If you're  part of the 73 percent, the answers are ""more than $102,"" ""less than today,"" and ""false."") Even when controlling for other factors, men were more likely to respond correctly than women, and attending college or even just graduating from high school also made correct answers more likely.</p> \n<p>A biannual survey of high school seniors from the<span> Jump$tart Coalition for Personal Financial Literacy </span><span>found they knew less about personal finance in 2008 than in any year since at least 1997.

While for the first part of the 19th century, American stocks and bonds were roughly equivalent in performance, stocks have pulled away ever since.</p> \n<p><span>Siegel helpfully summarizes his findings in the chart below. Keep in mind while reading it that, unlike the other charts in this post, it's logarithmic rather than linear. Stocks in 2012 are a little less than twice as high up the chart as bonds, but they did way, way, way better than twice as well. If you invested $1 in stocks in 1802, you'd have $704,997 (after adjusting for inflation) in 2012. If you invested $1 in bonds, you'd have $1,778. That's a two order of magnitude difference, not a factor of two difference:</span></p> \n<center> \n<p><img src=""http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/assets/4718370/siegel_returns.png"" class=""photo"" alt=""Siegel_returns""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Source: Jeremy Siegel / McGraw-Hill</p> \n</center> \n<p>Gold has never even come close. Similarly, real estate has generally generated returns in line with inflation — far below the returns to stocks or bonds. Nobel-winning economist Robert Shiller once <a href=""http://pragcap.com/robert-shiller-dont-invest-in-housing"">noted</a> that from 1890 to 1990 (before the '90s/00s real estate bubble), the appreciation in housing in the US was roughly zero. ""If you think investing in housing is such a great idea, why not invest in cars?"" he <a href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/robert-shiller-home-investment-a-fad-2013-2"">elaborated</a>. ""Buy a car, mothball it, and sell it in 20 years. Obviously not a good idea because people won't want our cars. It's the same with our houses. So, they're not really an investment vehicle.""</p> \n<p>Stocks' advantages hold up even if you focus in on recent decades. While the stock market took a beating in 2008, while bonds proved more resilient, the investment firm BlackRock <a href=""http://www.blackrock.com/investing/literature/investor-education/asset-class-returns-one-pager-va-us.pdf"">found</a> that you'd still be better off investing in stocks from 1994 to 2013. It didn't make a huge amount of difference whether you chose ""small cap"" stocks (shares in firms worth between the hundreds of millions to low billions, and represented here by the Russell 2000 index) or ""large caps."" That said, ""growth"" large caps, which cost more relative to company earnings but have higher forecasted growth potential, underperformed compared to ""value"" large caps, which have worse growth forecasts but better earnings ratios.</p> \n<p>A diversified portfolio, with 35 percent of assets in bonds and 65 percent in various kinds of stocks, performed worse than any pure-stock portfolio, but much better than bond (or ""fixed income"") investments or international stocks. All told, a diversified portfolio did 60.5 percent better than a bond portfolio, and an investment in the S&amp;P 500 (""large cap core"") did 91 percent better:</p> \n<center> \n<p><img src=""http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/assets/4718394/blackrock_asset_classes.png"" class=""photo"" alt=""Blackrock_asset_classes""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Source: BlackRock</p> \n</center> \n<p>It's important, however, not to interpret this as a sign that your portfolio now, forever, and always should be mostly or solely in stocks (and it certainly doesn't mean you should be buying and selling individual stocks, but that's a matter for another post). A heavy weighting toward stocks makes sense for young investors who want to maximize savings 50 to 60 years in the future; in that case, long-run returns are the most relevant factor to consider. But the closer one gets to cashing out investments, the more volatility starts to matter. Knowing that the S&amp;P 500 outperforms bonds in the long-run is small comfort when the economy collapses right before you retire and your S&amp;P investments <a href=""http://www.frbatlanta.org/cenfis/pubscf/stock_prices_infinancial_crisis.cfm"">lose 56.8 percent of their value</a> in little over a year.</p> \n<p>Siegel has another chart illustrating this point well. It shows the best and worst performances for stocks, bonds, and short-term Treasuries over different periods of time. For short periods (less than 10 years), the worst performance for stocks is below the worst performance for bonds, and the best performance for stocks is higher than the best for bonds; over the short-run, bonds are a safer bet. But for periods of 10 years and more, the worst performance by stocks is actually better than the worst by bonds, even as the best performance remain higher than the best bond performance. Stocks become both a better investment <i>and</i> less risky than bonds over a long enough time span:</p> \n<center> \n<p><img src=""http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/assets/4718570/Screen_Shot_2014-07-07_at_12.25.01_PM.png"" class=""photo"" alt=""Screen_shot_2014-07-07_at_12.25.01_pm""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Source: Jeremy Siegel / McGraw-Hill</p> \n</center> \n<p>Does this mean that there will never be a long-run period over which bonds outperform stocks? Nope; indeed, Siegel notes that bonds narrowly edged out stocks from the beginning of 1982 to the end of 2011. But that's a fluke attributable to both the extremely high bond interest rates of the early 1980s and the crash of 2008. Before that, the last time bonds beat stocks over a 30 year period was from the start of 1832 to the end of 1861.</p> \n<p><span>It's always possible these trends will reverse in the future, of course. As Shiller once </span><a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2001/04/12/business/economic-scene-history-lesson-don-t-count-stocks-lead-way-downturn.html"" style=""background-color: #ffffff;"">noted</a><span>, Siegel's data largely comes from ""the most economically successful century for the most economically successful nation of all time."" But going off of historical trends isn't the worst course of action in an uncertain world.</span></p> \n<p><span></span><span>And those trends do suggest that, in the short-run, it's much more reasonable to move toward bonds. As a table of Siegel's shows, over time the probability that stocks will underperform bonds shrinks dramatically. It doesn't hit zero — stocks won 99.3 percent of 30 year intervals from 1871 to 2012 — but it gets very close. But that also means that there's a reasonably high chance bonds will out-perform over a one to five year interval:</span></p> \n<center> \n<p><img src=""http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/assets/4718594/Screen_Shot_2014-07-07_at_12.33.01_PM.png"" class=""photo"" alt=""Screen_shot_2014-07-07_at_12.33.01_pm""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Source: Jeremy Siegel / McGraw-Hill</p> \n</center> \n<p>So it makes sense to move into lower-risk, lower-return investments the closer you get to wanting to cash out.</p>",Business & Finance

Follow these four simple rules and you'll be on your way to a comfortable retirement.,"<p>Retirement planning is a topic that fills many people with dread. Not just because saving is difficult, but because advice on how to do it well is complex, confusing, and often contradictory.</p> \n<p>Vox is here to help. While saving for retirement seems complicated, there are four simple rules that — if followed — will get you on the path to a comfortable retirement:</p> \n<ul> \n<li><span>Save 12 to 15 percent of your income each year beginning in your 20s. If you're over 30 and haven't started saving yet, begin as soon as possible.</span></li> \n<li>Diversify. Invest in mutual funds that give you exposure to a wide variety of stocks and bonds, both in the US and overseas.</li> \n<li><span>Take a long-term perspective. Younger investors should invest mostly in stocks. Resist the urge to panic sell when the market falls. As you get older, gradually shift your investments into bonds.</span></li> \n<li><span>Don't let mutual fund companies rip you off with high fees. Choose the most affordable mutual funds you can find, and don't be fooled by funds that claim they can beat the market. For novice investors, a <a href=""https://investor.vanguard.com/mutual-funds/target-retirement/"">Vanguard Target Retirement fund</a> is a good option, though not all employers offer it in their 401(k) plans.</span></li> \n</ul> \n<p>That's it. If you follow these four rules, you have a high probability of enjoying a comfortable retirement.

That's the approximate rate you can get from a life annuity, an insurance product that pays a fixed (inflation-adjusted) amount each month until you die.</p> \n<p>The calculator assumes you'll need 80 percent of your pre-retirement income to live comfortably. It assumes that you'll receive annual raises of 3 percent (plus cost of living) until age 50, and that after that you'll only get cost-of-living increases. It assumes you'll get average stock market returns (after inflation) of 4 percent. (These assumptions can all be changed by clicking ""Show advanced options."")</p> \n<p>It takes into account your projected Social Security benefit. Social Security has a progressive benefit formula, meaning that wealthier taxpayers have a smaller fraction of their income replaced in retirement. So the wealthier you are, the more you'll need to save to replace your pre-retirement income.</p> \n<p>To protect your privacy, all calculations are done inside your browser.

Notice that even after stock market crashes in 2001-'03 and 2008-'09, our hypothetical investor still had more than twice his initial investment.</p> \n<p>A fundamental principle of investing is that there's a trade-off between risk and reward. A savings account is a much safer place to put your money than the stock market in the short run, but staying out of the stock market is likely to leave you poorer in the long run.</p> \n<p>In 2008 the S&amp;P 500 — an index of the stocks of the 500 largest companies in America — <a href=""http://finance.yahoo.com/echarts?s=%5EGSPC+Interactive#symbol=%5EGSPC;range=1y"">lost more than a third of its value</a>. The experience soured many people on the whole concept of investing in the stock market. <span>Yet it's important to look at things from a long-term perspective. </span><span>Anyone who started investing in the 1970s, 1980s, or early 1990s was still ahead after the 2008 crash. And anyone who held on to their stocks through the 2008 stock market plunge enjoyed big gains over the next six years. By the start of 2015, the market had regained all of its losses and was setting new records.</span></p> \n<p><q class=""right"" aria-hidden=""true""><span>By the end of 2013, the market had erased all of its 2008 losses and then some</span></q></p> \n<p>Things look even better if we look further back in history. Since the modern stock market emerged in the late 19th century, there has never been a 20-year period when average stock market returns were negative. Since 1915, the average return on the 500 largest US stocks — after adjusting for inflation — has been 6.9 percent.</p> \n<p>So in the long run, stocks are likely to provide higher returns than less volatile investments. And if you're under 45, you can afford to take a long-term view. If the stock market crashes next month, you'll still have 20 years for the value of your portfolio to rebound. The odds are high that you'll come out ahead.</p> \n<p><span>But it's essential not to panic when the stock market does fall. When the stock market crashed in 2008, a lot of people were tempted to sell. But that proved to be a big mistake. People who held on to their stocks wound up way ahead of people who sold in 2008 or 2009.</span></p> \n<h3>Diversification lowers risk</h3> \n<p><img src=""http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/assets/4777362/1765502.jpg"" class=""photo"" alt=""1765502""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">(<a href=""http://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/mature-couple-jogging-outdoors-news-photo/1765502"">Al Bello/Getty Images</a>)</p> \n<p>Okay, so you should buy some stocks. Which ones? The answer is simple: Buy all of them.</p> \n<p>Individual stocks can be extremely volatile. There's always a risk that you'll pick the next Enron and be left with nothing. But there's more safety in numbers. On any given day, one stock might crash but others will be rising. So a basket of many stocks is less volatile than any single stock by itself.</p> \n<p>This is known as diversification. And it applies beyond the American stock market. In addition to buying domestic stocks, you should also buy some foreign stocks. And you should buy bonds — the debt of corporations and governments.</p> \n<p><span>Bonds are less volatile than stocks, and the value of stocks and bonds often move in opposite directions. So a mixed portfolio of stocks and bonds is a lot less volatile than an all-stock portfolio.</span></p> \n<p><span>It would be a huge hassle to buy thousands of stocks one at a time. But fortunately, mutual fund companies have made the process relatively painless. Mutual fund companies offer funds that allow you to buy a small share of thousands of different stocks or bonds — just by buying into one fund.</span></p> \n<h3>Don't try to beat the market</h3> \n<p><img src=""http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/assets/4777394/1200px-Jimcramerphoto.jpg"" class=""photo"" alt=""1200px-jimcramerphoto""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Pay no attention to stock tips from finance gurus like CNBC's Jim Cramer. (<a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/tulanesally/5103136864/"">Tulane</a>)</p> \n<p><span>Open a personal finance magazine and you'll see articles touting the latest hot stock tips. You'll also see ads from mutual fund companies touting their above-average investment returns. The evidence suggests that this is all kind of a scam.</span></p> \n<p><q class=""right"" aria-hidden=""true""><span>Active mutual fund managers don't produce returns higher than the market average</span></q></p> \n<p>A lot of people on Wall Street make a lot of money by convincing ordinary investors that they can provide better-than-average returns. But the reality is that beating the market is really difficult. Most people who promise to do it don't deliver.</p> \n<p>In the 1960s, academic researchers began to show that ""active"" mutual fund managers — those who try to select stocks that will perform better than average — don't produce higher average returns than the market as a whole. This research led to the rise of a new type of mutual fund known as an index fund. Rather than trying to beat the market, these passively managed funds simply try to match the returns of a stock index such as the S&amp;P 500. Index funds allow investors to earn the average market return, with as few expenses as possible.</p> \n<p><span>A half-century later, studies are still finding that </span><a href=""http://www.rickferri.com/WhitePaper.pdf"">passively managed funds tend to beat actively managed ones</a><span>. It's hard to outperform the market, but it's easy to waste clients' money trying. The higher expenses of actively managed funds wind up coming out of the pocket of ordinary investors.</span></p> \n<p>So when choosing mutual funds, your most important criteria should be keeping costs down. Every mutual fund publishes an ""expense ratio,"" which is the percentage of your investment that will get eaten up by management expenses each year. Whenever you have a choice between two similar funds, you should pick the one with lower expenses.</p> \n<h3>Pick the fund with the lowest fees and expenses</h3> \n<p><img src=""http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/assets/4776970/452318646.jpg"" class=""photo"" alt=""452318646""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">(<a href=""http://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/young-chinese-couple-taking-photos-in-hong-kong-with-an-news-photo/452318646"">Stefan Irvine/LightRocket via Getty Images</a>)</p> \n<p>Which fund should you buy? The best type of fund for a novice investor is a ""target retirement"" fund. You pick the year you want to retire, and the fund automatically allocates your savings to a mix of stocks and bonds that's appropriate for your expected retirement date.</p> \n<p>There are two good options for target retirement funds. Vanguard funds such as the<span> </span><a href=""https://investor.vanguard.com/mutual-funds/target-retirement/#/mini/overview/0699"">Target Retirement 2050</a><span> plan have a modest expense ratio of 0.18 percent,</span><span> meaning that investors lose just $18 per year for every $10,000 invested. (Disclosure: I have most of my retirement savings in Vanguard mutual funds, and because Vanguard is structured as a cooperative, that technically makes me a Vanguard shareholder.)</span></p> \n<p><span>Recently, </span><a href=""http://www.ssgafunds.com/product/fund.seam?ticker=SSDLX"" target=""_blank"" sl-processed=""1"">State Street Bank</a> and <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://fundresearch.fidelity.com/mutual-funds/summary/315793869"">Fidelity</a> began <span>offering low-cost index funds of their own. With expense ratios of 0.17 percent and 0.16 percent, respectively — slightly cheaper than Vanguard's — these are also great options.</span></p> \n<p><q class=""right"" aria-hidden=""true""><span>These expenses </span><span>can add up to thousands of dollars in lost returns</span></q></p> \n<p>Unfortunately, most other target retirement funds are a lot more expensive. For example, while the Fidelity Freedom Index funds have low costs, Fidelity also sells a similarly named<a href=""https://fundresearch.fidelity.com/mutual-funds/summary/315792416"" target=""_blank"" sl-processed=""1""> ""Freedom 2050""</a> fund with an expense ratio of 0.77 percent. <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www3.troweprice.com/fb2/fbkweb/snapshot.do?ticker=TRRMX"" sl-processed=""1"">T. Rowe Price's Retirement 2050</a> funds has an expense ratio of 0.76 percent. If you invest $10,000 in these funds, you'll lose more than $70 every year (and more as your money grows). That's a terrible deal.</p> \n<p>Unfortunately, employers don't always offer their employees access to low-cost target retirement funds. If your employer is one of them, you'll need to do a bit of extra work. Instead of buying a single target retirement fund, you'll want to invest in funds from the three categories I mentioned before: domestic stocks, international stocks, and bonds.</p> \n<p>For each category, you'll want to choose the broadest fund with the lowest expense ratio. For example, Fidelity's <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://fundresearch.fidelity.com/mutual-funds/summary/315911800"">Spartan Total Market fund</a>, with an expense ratio as low as 0.05 percent, is a good choice for domestic stocks. It invests in more than 3,000 US stocks. Fidelity also has a <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://fundresearch.fidelity.com/mutual-funds/summary/315911875"">Spartan International fund</a> <span>(0.12 percent expense ratio)</span><span> for international stocks and a </span><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://fundresearch.fidelity.com/mutual-funds/summary/316146372"">Spartan US Bond fund</a><span> </span><span>(0.10 percent expense ratio)</span><span> for bonds.</span></p> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3524558/Screen_Shot_2015-02-05_at_2.12.55_PM.0.0.png"" alt=""Screen_Shot_2015-02-05_at_2.12.55_PM.0.0.png"" data-chorus-asset-id=""3524558""></p> \n<p>Unfortunately, many mutual fund companies don't offer low-cost index funds. The table above shows some of the largest mutual fund companies in America, along with their lowest-cost fund in the three asset categories I mentioned before. In the right column is a weighted average of these expenses, assuming a portfolio of 60 percent domestic stocks, 20 percent international stocks, and 20 percent bonds.</p> \n<div class=""align-right""> \n<p><img alt=""454430413"" class=""photo"" src=""http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/assets/4777810/454430413.jpg""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">(<a href=""http://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/senior-man-jogging-along-the-beach-with-dog-news-photo/454430413"">Education Images/UIG via Getty images</a>)</p> \n</div> \n<p>As you can see, only Fidelity and Vanguard offer truly low-cost index funds. These companies let you construct a diversified portfolio with an expense ratio as low as 0.07 percent. State Street is next, offering funds with expense ratios of 0.16 percent or lower. But the other companies on the list charge 3 to 8 times as much as Vanguard and Fidelity.</p> \n<p>While a fraction of a percentage point might not seem like a big difference, these expenses <span>can add up to thousands of dollars in lost returns over the course of a typical worker's career. So if your employer only offers high-cost mutual funds in your 401(k) plan, you might want to ask your HR department to add lower-cost options from Vanguard, Fidelity, or State Street.</span></p> \n<p>If that doesn't work, you should consider consider opting out of your employer's 401(k) plan altogether and invest in an IRA (discussed below) instead. That would allow you to take advantage of low-cost index funds or — even better — Vanguard's low-cost target retirement funds. But the <a href=""http://www.irs.gov/publications/p590/"">rules</a> about when you can do that are complicated and beyond the scope of this article.</p> \n<h3>Keep your portfolio balanced</h3> \n<p>If you don't have a target retirement fund, then you'll need to decide how much money to allocate to different types of funds. Here are some guidelines:</p> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""3527740"" alt=""savings_ratios.0.png"" src=""https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3527740/savings_ratios.0.png""></p> \n<p>If you're under 45, you should have most of your money in high-risk, high-reward stocks (including both domestic and foreign companies), and only a small share in safe, low-return bonds. As you get older, you'll want to gradually shift to more bonds. About half of your retirement savings should be in bonds by the time you reach retirement age.</p> \n<p>The exact ratio of stocks to bonds depends on how much risk you feel comfortable taking. If seeing the stock market plunge gives you heartburn, you might want to allocate a larger share of your portfolio to bonds. If you're willing to take a bit more risk in pursuit of higher returns, you should have a portfolio that's weighted more toward stocks. Of course, the closer you are to retirement the more conservative you'll want to be with your money.</p> \n<p><q class=""right"" aria-hidden=""true""><span>If you're under 40, you should have most of your money in high-risk, high-reward stocks</span></q></p> \n<p>In some years, stocks will perform dramatically better than bonds, pushing the ratio of stocks to bonds upward. In other years, stock prices will fall, leading to a portfolio with bonds over-represented. When this happens, you should sell some of the over-represented assets and buy more of the under-represented ones, bringing your portfolio back into balance.</p> \n<p>This will mean selling assets that have performed well and buying assets that perform poorly. That might seem counterintuitive, but think about it this way: Selling stocks as they rise helps to lock in some of the profits even if prices subsequently crash. And buying stocks when they're cheap gives you more upside if they subsequently rise in value.</p> \n<p>Target retirement funds handle this chore for you automatically. If you're managing your portfolio yourself, then you'll want to log in every six months to make sure the ratio of stocks to bonds (and of domestic stocks to international ones) stays on target.</p> \n<h3><span>Don't fall behind on savings just because you don't have a 401(k) plan at work</span></h3> \n<p><img src=""http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/assets/4777426/144095746.jpg"" class=""photo"" alt=""144095746""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">(<a href=""http://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/senior-couple-outdoors-news-photo/144095746"">Education Images/UIG via Getty Images</a>)</p> \n<p><span>If you have a job that offers a 401(k) plan, this is a convenient way to save for retirement. The money is automatically deducted from your paycheck, helping you to stay on track. And you don't have to pay taxes on money in your 401(k) until you withdraw it in retirement.</span></p> \n<p>But if you don't have a 401(k) at work — or you don't have a full-time job at all — you should still be saving for retirement. Congress has created a separate system for people in this situation. Known as an Individual Retirement Account, it provides tax benefits similar to those of a 401(k) for those who don't have an employer-sponsored retirement plan.</p> \n<p>There are two types of IRAs. A traditional IRA works a lot like a 401(k) plan. Contributions can be deducted from your taxes, and taxes are deferred on earnings. But as with a 401(k), you have to pay a hefty penalty if you take out the money before you reach retirement age. And you also pay taxes on money you withdraw from the IRA during retirement.</p> \n<p>A Roth IRA works the other way around: You pay taxes when you put money in, but earnings and withdrawals are tax-free once you retire. You can also withdraw your contributions (but not earnings) to a Roth IRA at any time without paying a penalty.</p> \n<p>Which one you should pick depends on whether you expect your tax rate in retirement to be higher or lower than the tax rate you're paying now. When you're just starting your career, you might be in a lower tax bracket than you expect to be in later in life. In that case, a Roth IRA is a good choice. On the other hand, if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, then a traditional IRA might make more sense.</p> \n<p>There are also <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.irs.gov/Retirement-Plans/Amount-of-Roth-IRA-Contributions-That-You-Can-Make-For-2015"">income-based limits</a> on contributing to IRAs, so if you make more than $116,000 you'll want to double-check your eligibility (and also check if you're eligible for the <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.betterment.com/resources/retirement/401ks-and-iras/roth-ira-rules-smart-ways-to-avoid-taxes-on-a-conversion/"">back-door Roth loophole</a>).</p> \n<p> \n<script src=""http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1/jquery.min.js""></script> \n<script src=""http://ajax.aspnetcdn.com/ajax/jquery.validate/1.9/jquery.validate.min.js""></script> \n<script type=""text/javascript""><!-- \njQuery.validator.addMethod(""money"", function(value, element) { \n\treturn this.optional(element) ||  \n               /^\\$?(\\d{1,3}(\\,\\d{3})*|(\\d+))(\\.\\d{2})?$/.test(value); \n}, ""Error""); \n \njQuery.validator.addMethod(""money_and_married"", function(value, element) { \n\treturn ((this.optional(element)  \n                 || /^\\$?(\\d{1,3}(\\,\\d{3})*|(\\d+))(\\.\\d{2})?$/.test(value)) \n               || !($(""#married"").is(':checked'))); \n}, ""Error""); \n \njQuery.validator.addMethod(""age_and_married"", function(value, element) { \n\treturn !($(""#married"").is(':checked')) || \n               (parseInt(value) > 12 && parseInt(value) < 68); \n}, ""Error""); \n \n$( document ).ready( function () { \n \n  $(""select#return_rate"").val(""4""); \n  $(""select#wage_growth"").val(""3""); \n  $(""select#retirement_age"").val(""67""); \n  $(""select#income_replacement_rate"").val(""80""); \n  $(""select#social_security_reduction"").val(""0""); \n  $('input:radio[name=""marital_status""][value=""single""]').click(); \n \n  $( ""#retirement_form"" ).validate( { \n      rules: { \n          income: \n          { \n            required: true, \n            money: true, \n          }, \n          age:  \n          { \n            required: true, \n            number: true, \n            min: 13, \n            max: 67, \n          }, \n          current_savings:  \n          { \n            required: true, \n            money: true, \n          }, \n          spouse_income:  \n          { \n            required: ""#married:checked"", \n            money_and_married: true, \n          }, \n          spouse_age:  \n          { \n            required: ""#married:checked"", \n            age_and_married: true, \n          }, \n      }, \n      messages: { \n          income: ""Please enter your income"", \n          age: ""Please enter an age between 13 and 67"", \n          current_savings: ""Please enter your current savings"", \n          spouse_income: ""Please enter your spouse's income"", \n          spouse_age: ""Please enter an age between 13 and 67"", \n      }, \n      submitHandler: calculate, \n  }); \n}); \n// --></script> \n<script type=""text/javascript""><!-- \n// Grab data from the form and do a bunch of calculations \n \nfunction calculate() { \n \n    // Age of the user \n \n    age = parseInt(document.getElementById(""age"").value); \n \n    // Current income of the user \n \n    income = getDollar(document.getElementById(""income"").value); \n \n    // Average rate of return on savings \n \n    return_rate = parseInt(document.getElementById(""return_rate"").value)/100; \n \n    // Desired age of retirement \n \n    retirement_age = parseInt(document.getElementById(""retirement_age"").value); \n \n    // How much will Congress cut Social Security benefits?

Is a more prestigious college worth the money?,http://www.vox.com/2014/8/5/5968681/expensive-college-worth-it,The research says it depends in part on who you are.,"<p>Study after study has shown that graduates of elite colleges tend to earn more later in life. Does that mean their <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/7/31/5951883/how-much-college-costs-sticker-price-net-price"">sticker price</a> of up to $60,000 per year is worth it?</p> \n<p>Economists have researched this question for decades, and the answer is surprisingly complicated. In general, the better the college, the more money graduates make later in life. But because elite colleges are filled with academically talented students who disproportionately come from wealthy families, it's hard to disentangle cause from effect.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""right""><span>the better the college, the more money graduates make</span></q></p> \n<p><span>Do elite colleges really change the trajectory of students' lives and earnings? Or are they just better at picking out students who were going to succeed in the first place? </span></p> \n<p><span>The research shows that the answer to these questions depends heavily on who you are. </span></p> \n<h3>The scenario: You're choosing between paying full price at a prestigious college and a full-ride scholarship at a less prestigious college</h3> \n<p><span>Is it better to take the free education, or to pay much, much more for a more prestigious name? </span></p> \n<p>Carolyn Hoxby, a labor economist at Stanford University, <a href=""http://www.nyu.edu/classes/jepsen/hoxby-selective.pdf"">examined data</a> for colleges with varying levels of admissions selectivity and estimated the return on investment for jumping up two selectivity levels — say from St. Lawrence University to Tufts University. Hoxby's data only include men, using lifetime earnings data for students who started college in 1982 to predict outcomes for students who entered college in 1997. In general, after taking students' college aptitude into account, she found that a more prestigious college still led to higher lifetime earnings.</p> \n<p><span>Hoxby's findings made a </span><span>free ride look like less of a good deal in some, but not all, cases. A student who turns down a free ride at a private college considered ""very competitive plus"" (St. Lawrence, for example) and paid the full price at a ""highly competitive plus"" college instead (Tufts) would break even after 15 years and earn more for the rest of his life.</span></p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""left""><span>many colleges have become much more competitive</span></q></p> \n<p>The biggest problem with applying Hoxby's findings to today's college students is that many colleges have become much more competitive since the paper was published. Many of the colleges she includes as examples of colleges that are selective, but not as competitive as the Ivy League and some exclusive liberal arts colleges, are now in the top tier of selectivity. That doesn't mean her findings are invalid, but it makes it more difficult to apply to individual situations now.</p> \n<h3>The scenario: You're the first in your family to go to college, or you're from a black or Hispanic family</h3> \n<p>A more selective college is likely to pay off over the long run. Two economists, Stacy Dale and Alan Kreuger, have <a href=""http://www.nber.org/papers/w17159.pdf"">researched</a> whether elite colleges really lead to higher lifetime earnings when you take other factors into account, such as students' academic background and the other colleges where they were admitted. <span>The colleges they examined were a fairly </span><a href=""http://The%20colleges%20they%20examined%20were%20a%20rather%20small%20group%20that%20range%20from%20selective%20%E2%80%94%20Wesleyan%20University%20and%20Xavier%20University,%20for%20example%20%E2%80%94%20to%20extraordinarily%20selective,%20such%20as%20Yale%20and%20Stanford.)"">small group</a><span> that ranged from selective but less prestigious institutions such as Wesleyan and Xavier to Yale, Stanford and Harvard. </span></p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""right""><span>attending a more elite college really did boost lifetime earnings</span></q></p> \n<p>Dale's and Kreuger's research found mixed results for many groups on whether attending Stanford over Wesleyan was worth it. But for students from disadvantaged backgrounds, or for students who were black or Latino, they found that attending a more elite college really did boost lifetime earnings.</p> \n<p>Because Dale and Krueger looked at decades of earnings data, they researched students who started college decades ago, in 1976 and 1989. But their rationale seems as if it could be true for today's students as well: ""While most students who apply to selective colleges may be able to rely on their families and friends to provide job-networking opportunities, networking opportunities that become available from attending a selective college may be particularly valuable for black and Hispanic students, and for students from less educated families,"" they wrote.</p> \n<h3><span>The scenario: You're a student from a college-educated family who applied to several prestigious colleges and is trying to decide which to attend</span></h3> \n<div><br></div> \n<div>You may be the kind of student who will succeed whether you attend Wesleyan or Yale. Dale and Krueger's <a href=""http://www.nber.org/papers/w17159.pdf"">research</a> found that if you take not just students' own academic backgrounds, but their parents' education and the other colleges to which students applied into account, the earnings advantage for the most elite colleges virtually disappears.</div> \n<div><br></div> \n<div>Students who were admitted to a highly selective college but ended up enrolling at a slightly less selective one had almost identical earnings at age 35. And it turns turns out that simply aspiring to attend a highly selective college is a strong predictor of lifetime earnings. <span>As Dale </span><a href=""http://www.forbes.com/2009/08/07/elite-university-earnings-salary-opinions-colleges-09-dale.html"">wrote about her research in Forbes magazine</a><span>, ""Who you are matters more than where you go to college.""</span>\n</div> \n<div><br></div> \n<div>Whether that's ultimately reassuring or depressing depends on your point of view.</div> \n<h3><span>The scenario: You're debating between a state flagship university and another, less prestigious public university</span></h3> \n<p>The verdict: The state flagship university is probably worth it, at least if you're a white man. Mark Hoekstra, an associate professor of economics at Texas A&amp;M University, <a href=""http://www.econ.pitt.edu/papers/Mark_flagship.pdf"">compared</a> white male students who just missed the SAT cutoff for admission to the most elite public university in an unnamed state with those who were just above the cutoff. The men who were admitted to and attended the flagship university earned about 20 percent more between ages 28 and 33 than the men who did not.</p> \n<p>The study has some weaknesses — chief among them that it's not clear where the men who weren't admitted to the state flagship actually attended college, although enrollment patterns in that state suggest that they did attend other, less prestigious in-state public universities. For women, the effects were less clear, in part because women's earning patterns vary more if they take time away from work to have children.</p> \n<h3>The caveats</h3> \n<p>Much of this assumes that highly priced is the same as high quality. Particularly for working-class and middle class families, the most elite colleges <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/7/31/5951883/how-much-college-costs-sticker-price-net-price"">aren't always the most expensive</a>. College pricing is complicated, and the colleges with the biggest endowments can often afford the most generous financial aid.</p> \n<p>Second, this research often compares colleges that, in the grand scheme of American higher education, are all considered selective. The question researchers tangle with is Penn versus Penn State, not the Ivy League versus a local community college — a pressing issue for the students who can get into both, but less important considering that the majority of students go to nonselective public colleges.</p> \n<p>Third, while economists use lifetime earnings as the way to measure the value of a degree, they're far from the only way to determine whether or not students got a quality education.</p> \n<p>Finally, because studying lifetime earnings requires a long time frame, much of this research looks at students who entered college in the late 1970s or early 1980s. Since then, the price of college tuition has increased and many of the most selective colleges have become even more selective. It's not clear how this might affect the results.</p>",Business & Finance
An economist and a personal finance expert teach you money,http://www.vox.com/2014/8/7/5975799/budget-household-helaine-olen-harold-pollack,An economist and a personal finance expert share their suggestions for how to plan your spending.,"<p>Especially early in life, when you've just started working for a living, figuring out exactly how to budget your income can be tricky. In theory, all you have to do is balance what's going in with what's coming out, but, as we all know, that's much easier said than done. <span>It's tempting to embrace simple, all-encompassing philosophies — like putting certain chunks of your income in ""envelopes"" devoted to certain kinds of expenses — but those </span><a href=""http://www.slate.com/articles/double_x/doublex/2013/04/the_envelope_method_for_household_budgets_is_a_bad_idea.html"" style=""line-height: 1.5; background-color: #ffffff;"">tend to screw you</a><span> whenever the composition of your spending changes.</span></p> \n<p>So the best approach probably isn't adopting one holistic framework so much as implementing smaller, concrete suggestions to make things slightly easier around the edges. To get a sense of a few of them, I talked to writer Helaine Olen (whose book <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Pound-Foolish-Exposing-Personal-Industry/dp/159184679X/ref=la_B00DX5ATYQ_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1407422217&amp;sr=1-1""><i>Pound Foolish</i></a> is perhaps the best takedown available of personal finance hucksters) and to Harold Pollack, the Helen Ross Professor at the University of Chicago's School of Social Service Administration and author of <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/09/16/this-4x6-index-card-has-all-the-financial-advice-youll-ever-need/"">the only index card</a> you need to understand your finances. Pollack and Olen are working on a book of evidence-based financial advice at the moment, but they graciously shared some of their tips with Vox in the meantime.</p> \n<h3>1) Gather data</h3> \n<center> \n<p><img src=""http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/assets/4871424/mint.jpg"" class=""photo"" alt=""Mint""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Mint has the key advantage of being free. (<a href=""https://www.mint.com/public/screenshots/transactions.jpg"">Intuit</a>)</p> \n</center> \n<p>Before you actually set about creating a budget, you need to know where your money is actually going.</p> \n<p>""Most of us do not have a budget and we don't really know what we're spending our money on. It just kind of comes in and out,"" Olen says. ""The first thing to do is figure out where it's going, and the only way to do that is to track it for several months.""</p> \n<p>There are a few reasons for the length of that sample period. One is that you obviously can't rely on less than a month's data, given that many major expenses — rent/mortgage payments/condo fees, cable and electric bills, etc. — come in on a monthly basis. But the more important reason is that your spending will differ from month to month and getting more data will let you smooth out those fluctuations and get less noisy picture.</p> \n<p>Luckily there's never been a better time to do this. Olen says that earlier in life she simply wrote out everything she bought on a legal pad to get a sense of her consumption habits; today, apps like <a href=""https://www.mint.com/"">Mint</a> or <a href=""http://quicken.intuit.com/"">Quicken</a> or <a href=""http://infinitekind.com/moneydance"">Moneydance</a> will do that for you automatically using data from your credit cards and bank accounts, and categorize your spending as you go.</p> \n<h3>2) Don't sweat the small stuff as much</h3> \n<center> \n<p><img src=""http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/assets/4871432/shutterstock_125612351.jpg"" class=""photo"" alt=""Shutterstock_125612351""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Not gonna bankrupt you. (<a href=""http://www.shutterstock.com/"">Shutterstock</a>)</p> \n</center> \n<p>This is a point Olen made well in <i>Pound Foolish</i> but it bears repeating. There's a myth out there that the key to getting your budget under control is cutting back on small niceties: eating out less, taking the bus rather than Uber more, not getting that afternoon latte. But for most people, that's not the issue. The biggest part of our budgets, by far, are fixed and/or emergency costs like housing, college tuition, and health care, rather than anything smaller. <span>Olen </span><a href=""http://books.google.com/books?id=cpRDQJQWPQwC&amp;q=latte#v=onepage&amp;q=lundy&amp;f=false"" style=""line-height: 1.5; background-color: #ffffff;"">cites</a><span> </span><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/The-Two-Income-Trap-Middle-Class-Parents/dp/0465090907"" style=""line-height: 1.5; background-color: #ffffff;"">research</a><span> by then-Harvard law professor Elizabeth Warren and Amelia Warren Tyagi suggesting that while only about half of peoples' incomes in 1973 went to fixed expenses, by the mid-2000s about 75 percent did.</span></p> \n<p><span>So overspending tends to happen after some intense upward shock to spending, like a medical emergency, or downward shock to income, like being laid off. Research by sociologist Jeff Lundy into overspending </span><a href=""http://www-personal.umich.edu/~lundyj/Dissertation/papers/LUNDY_OVERSPENDING_ASA_REVISED.pdf"" style=""line-height: 1.5; background-color: #ffffff;"">found</a><span> that the most common culprits behind it (especially for low-income families) are health shocks, poverty, and job loss, rather than seemingly frivolous discretionary spending. </span><span>Lundy finds that people who spend more on dining out are relatively unlikely to be overspenders — people are pretty good at knowing whether they have the disposable income available to indulge.</span><span> The data just isn't consistent with the view that your lattes are bankrupting you.</span></p> \n<h3>3) Keep an emergency fund</h3> \n<center> \n<p><img src=""http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/assets/4871440/shutterstock_4823338.jpg"" class=""photo"" alt=""Shutterstock_4823338""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">This is easier when you have an emergency fund. (<a href=""http://www.shutterstock.com/"">Shutterstock</a>)</p> \n</center> \n<p>One obvious takeaway from the fact that overspending often results from sudden shocks is that you should be stashing away money to make sure those shocks are manageable. Keep in mind that the things you're paying for need not be absolute emergencies so much as what Pollack calls ""expected unexpected expenses"": your car breaking down, being locked out of your apartment and needing a locksmith, needing to hire a plumber to fix your shower.</p> \n<p>Olen recommends you build up the fund until it's enough to sustain you for about three months. ""I don't mean three months of take home pay, but three months of what you absolutely can't live without,"" she says. ""Dinners out are not in your three month emergency fund, but your kids' college tuition is. Your mortgage payment is part of your emergency fund, but not new dishes for the kitchen.""</p> \n<p>As for where to put it, just make sure it's sufficiently liquid you can access it when the time comes. A savings or money market account is the obvious choice, though Olen notes some people come up with weird schemes where the first month's worth of savings is in a three month CD, and the the next in a two month CD, and so forth. ""How you optimally store the money is a second-order issue,"" Pollack says. ""You don't want to say you're going to set up a fund once you figure out if you want to put it into Treasuries or whatever.""</p> \n<h3>4) Don't care so much about your rewards program</h3> \n<center> \n<p><img src=""http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/assets/4871448/shutterstock_112639571.jpg"" class=""photo"" alt=""Shutterstock_112639571""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">A genuine Credit Card brand credit card — only available from Credit Card. (<a href=""http://www.shutterstock.com/"">Shutterstock</a>)</p> \n</center> \n<p>Pollack knows this is a controversial point, but he makes a decent argument. ""Be apathetic about your credit card reward program,"" he says. ""Don't think about free miles or cash back. The best of things are giving you 1-2 percent of what you're spending, and if you spend a little more because you're jazzed about your reward program, you've eliminated any benefits you're going to get from that.""</p> \n<p>There's some evidence bearing this point out. In 2010, the Chicago Fed's Sumit Agarwal, Sujit Chakravorti, and Anna Lunn <a href=""http://www.chicagofed.org/digital_assets/publications/working_papers/2010/wp2010_19.pdf"">found</a> that customers enrolled in a 1 percent cash back credit card program spent $68 more a month on average but got only $25 back. Worse, they decreased their monthly payments, resulting in a monthly debt increase of $115. The program was particularly effective at making dormant users of credit cards start spending (and accumulating debt) again. The program, they conclude, is ""a cost effective tool to increase bank revenue from increased spending and borrowing by cardholders."" The real rewards go to the bank, not you.</p> \n<h3>5) Trick yourself into spending less if you need to</h3> \n<center> \n<p><img src=""http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/assets/4871464/shutterstock_140850265.jpg"" class=""photo"" alt=""Shutterstock_140850265""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Make yourself do this every time. (<a href=""http://www.shutterstock.com/"">Shutterstock</a>)</p> \n</center> \n<p>Again, the small stuff isn't what sinks most people. But ultimately budgeting is about, as Pollack puts it, ""understanding what you actually want to spend your money on, given your various constraints and life goals."" Sometimes, spending impulsively gets in the way of that goal, not catastrophically but just enough to take money away from things that actually make you happy.</p> \n<p>If you find yourself having that problem, Olen has a whole bevy of tips for you.</p> \n<p>""Stay out of stores,"" she says. ""In all seriousness. I happen to love clothes quite a bit. One great budget tip is to not walk into clothing stores."" If most of your shopping is online? ""Don't store your credit card on any site. Trust me on this. Laziness is a very powerful deterrent for some people and the need to add your credit card info every time will reduce your spending.""</p> \n<p>But none of this is to say you shouldn't set aside money for fun. In fact, any budget you try to set will fail if it's too restrictive for you to realistically follow it. ""It's like the ways we fail on overly stringent diets, because we don't match the way we actually want to be eating,"" Pollack says. ""You don't want a 1200 calorie a day diet."" And you don't want a just-business budget either.</p>",Business & Finance
5 things you should know before getting a mortgage,http://www.vox.com/2014/10/6/6027085/mortgage-guide,Housing investments can be riskier â€” but also more lucrative â€” than their staid reputation indicates.,"<p>As Vox's own Dylan Matthews has written, over the long-term investments in a diverse portfolio of <a href=""http://www.vox.com/personal-finance/2014/7/22/5877329/less-than-a-quarter-of-americans-get-the-most-important-investment"">stocks tend to outperform any other asset class</a>. But there is nonetheless a solid case to be made for investments in housing for one simple reason — mortgages. A typical middle class American can't get a loan to buy stocks on favorable terms, but can get a loan to buy a house. That makes a big difference. But to take advantage of it, rather than be taken advantage of, you need to understand the system.</p> \n<p>Here are five things you should know.</p> \n<h3>1) A mortgage can magnify your gains</h3> \n<p><chorus-asset data-id=""658962""> <img src=""http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/658962/lever.0.jpg"" class=""small"" alt=""lever""> </chorus-asset></p> \n<p class=""caption"">(Shutterstock)</p> \n<p>Imagine putting $60,000 into a stock investment that appreciates in value 5 percent. That reaps you $3,000 in profit. Nice work. But now imagine instead that your $60,000 represented a 20 percent downpayment on a house worth $300,000. Now the house appreciates in value just 4 percent.</p> \n<p>That leaves you with a $312,000 house and a $240,000 debt to the bank. Pay the bank back, and you're left with $12,000 in profit. That's way better than the stock, even though the 4 percent return wasn't nearly as good as what happened with the stock.</p> \n<p>This is the power of what's known in finance circles as <i>leverage</i>. The ability to finance your investment with debt operates like a lever that allows you to reap much larger profits than are possible with non-leveraged investments. Mortgages are the ordinary investor's easiest access to leverage, and that makes larger profits possible.</p> \n<h3>2) Mortgages make houses very risky</h3> \n<p><chorus-asset data-id=""658964""> <img src=""http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/658964/shutterstock_150706244.0.jpg"" class=""small"" alt=""Risk""> </chorus-asset></p> \n<p class=""caption"">(Shutterstock)</p> \n<p>The stock market is a weird abstraction. Diversified investments like index funds are even more abstract. What's more, the value of stocks swings considerably on a day-to-day basis for reasons that are often hard to discern. By comparison a house seems solid, easy to understand, practical, and safe.</p> \n<p>But this intuition is very misleading. The same leverage that can create huge profit opportunities also make investments in mortgage-financed houses very risky.</p> \n<p>Say you put $60,000 into the stock market and it declines 25 percent. You're going to be pretty sad. But you still own $45,000 worth of stocks. If you're lucky, the market will go back up down the road. But if you're faced with a financial emergency and need to sell, you still have meaningful money. Now suppose instead that $60,000 was your downpayment on a $300,000 house. If the house declines 25 percent in value, you have a really big problem — your house is now worth $225,000 (which is still a lot) but you owe $240,000 to the bank. Just like with the stocks, you can hope the value goes back up again in the future. But if you're faced with an emergency, you're screwed. Your investment is worthless. In fact, it's less than worthless. You're <i>underwater</i> and owe the bank more than your house is worth.</p> \n<p>Don't let looks deceive you.

If things go south, the person who lent you the money isn't going to be able to get it all back and he's going to want to be compensated for that risk in the form of a high interest rate. Which is to say that <i>in general</i> there's no such thing as a free lunch when it comes to leverage and investing.</p> \n<p>But mortgages are special because of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.</p> \n<p>These were two companies set up by the government to buy mortgages from banks, making mortgage-lending much less risky. In turn, Fannie and Freddie financed their activities by selling bonds. Since the federal government had set the companies up, investors believed those bonds were implicitly guaranteed by the taxpayer and were willing to lend to Fannie and Freddie on the cheap. When they went bust in 2008, the Treasury Department did indeed step in and provide a bailout. Now the government formally owns Fannie and Freddie and formally stands behind their debts.</p> \n<p>That means that while there's no total free lunch in mortgage-financed housing investments, there is a discount lunch available. The federal government is bearing a share of the lender's risk, which means banks are willing to lend most people mortgage money at an artificially low price. This public policy initiative is why leverage in the specific form of mortgage financed housing can be especially attractive.</p> \n<h3>4) Long-term mortgages are good if you plan to stick around</h3> \n<p><chorus-asset data-id=""658972""> <img src=""http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/658972/467959459_28d88cedda_b.0.jpg"" class=""small"" alt=""Home Sweet Home""> </chorus-asset></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Refinanceability makes it especially sweet (<a href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/frumbert/467959459/in/photolist-9gEBHz-4dTVXE-Hmq3x-7nnENw-7nnBrm-7nj8Rr-7nobWU-7nnDDL-7no7wj-aB98TR-7njejZ-9n2eEj-7niHJi-7niGdP-7nnzAN-7no4ts-7njbjv-7no1Vm-7njgE6-7noadm-eLY1Rv-9t7mHG-kQ5SkX-bjDWDV-6nRbXu-oGqBYR-o6TxQu-8Dpubi-7dH69Q-7xmyNR-8FHAwE-9kVQdm-7ZaFGi-n16xx5-cUyv69-dJobfe-6up3c1-5k3ZQs-2ajv5E-9TkVkv-4UVPX8-5Lcfue-8uJ43U-z3DS-8hN4Zp-94tHJc-94wNuS-9c8ERE-4TgTtp-dX9Rsy"">Tim</a>)</p> \n<p>Fannie and Freddie don't just bring you discount interest rates, they're also largely responsible for the broad availability of the most common type of home loan — the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage.</p> \n<p>This lets you lock in an interest rate on very favorable terms. If economic circumstances change over the next few decades and market interest rates go up, you can keep paying the low rate you agreed to originally. But if economic circumstances change in the other direction and market interest rates fall, you can refinance your loan at a new lower rate. The ""heads you win, tails the bank loses"" aspect of this makes fixed-rate loans ideal for people who know they want to settle down in a house for the long run. These products exist primarily because of government subsidies, and there's a strong case for taking advantage of the subsidy if you fit the model.</p> \n<p>Basically similar 15-year and 20-year loans are also fairly common. These loans carry higher monthly payments because you're repaying the principle on a more aggressive schedule. But they also carry lower interest rates because they're less risky for the bank. If you can afford the higher payments, they <span>might be a good deal for you. </span></p> \n<h3>5) ARMs are good for reckless speculators</h3> \n<p><chorus-asset data-id=""659052""> <img src=""http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/659052/5277882656_b4bb5cefa6_b.0.jpg"" class=""small"" alt=""roulette""> </chorus-asset></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Spin the wheel (<a href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/zivkovic/5277882656/in/photolist-93owCQ-cofK7w-6nDw8D-bZYwLS-4zhv9d-abdYu3-93fEzp-bZSbtQ-6kcXXZ-cpf9t-7VN4zx-3S574K-gSrWVN-i64mX-g2GtDq-3Jaze-mdFbc-Kzbc9-aSwRde-4R4Umk-a7sRGW-6SeAc5-7feLHV-f2oVD1-fxoRZB-7Rv33a-8NH51S-mehA4e-e7D7aL-fxDahS-fxDaqf-KKMjJ-2gmuSV-92PJQ5-cHEuW-e7D6Md-e7xthH-oFW2Aa-nJmmC-bhcs9n-5Hz61d-48rMFu-3f6mV4-5XZUdv-otKVcd-fEZ9Z4-ow91t7-71vv9d-oeHu7q-ngcApG"">Zdenko Zivkovic</a>)</p> \n<p>The major alternative class of mortgages is <i>adjustable rate mortgages</i> where you start off with a low teaser rate for a number of years (three or five, usually) and then after that the interest rate resets to a higher level pegged on market conditions.</p> \n<p>The appeal of these products is supposed to be that they are ideal for people who don't plan on living in the same house for very long. You get the advantage of the low rates, and since you unload the house to a new buyer after a few years you never actually have to pay the adjustable rate. That's fine as far as it goes, but if you're not planning to stick around for long you really might want to consider renting — the traditional solution for short-term housing.</p> \n<p>Mortgage finance, as we've seen above, makes investments in housing riskier than they otherwise would be. And shorter-term investments are riskier than long-term ones. So a mortgage-financed investment in housing with a three or four year time span is actually a very risky investment no matter how solid and stable the house itself seems. If a very aggressive, very risky investment is what you're looking for then by all means fire away. But keep your eyes open about this.</p> \n<p>Mortgage brokers and real estate agents who collect fees if you buy a house and not if you rent one will be eager to explain to you that there are financially optimal ways to engage in short-term home ownership as a strategy. But just because ARMs are a good way to be a short-term home owner doesn't mean short-term home ownership is a good idea.</p>",Business & Finance

Clearly, the single parents represented above spend around $12,000 less over the course of 18 years than husband-wife families.</p> \n<p>But when you consider how much of their income they're spending, many single parents are shelling out a bigger share of their paychecks on their kids. Averaged out over 18 years, the single parent family from the above chart spends around $9,100 annually on a child, while that two-parent family spends just over $9,800. But average income for the single-parent family is $27,290, compared to $39,360 for the husband-wife family. That means the single-parent family is spending around one-third of its income on this child, while the husband-wife family is spending around one-quarter.</p> \n<p>However, single-parent families are by far more likely to earn less than $61,530. Fully 85 percent of single-parent families are below this threshold, compared to 33 percent of husband-wife families.</p> \n<h3>3) The more kids you have, the less expensive each one is</h3> \n<p><chorus-asset data-id=""658612""> <img src=""http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/658612/Screen_Shot_2014-08-18_at_10.00.36_AM.0.png"" class=""small"" alt=""Spending per child""> </chorus-asset></p> \n<p>The average husband-wife family's annual spending on one child is anywhere from $16,000 to $19,000, depending on that child's age.

For all sorts of reasons — hand-me-downs, you can transport more than one kid at a time — each additional kid costs less to raise. Above is an example for three hypothetical families, all of them two-parent and middle-income.

However, this doesn't take into account cost of living adjustments.

But there are good reasons to think that won't happen.,"<p>Is the AI apocalypse near? Movies like the Terminator franchise and the Matrix have long portrayed dystopian futures where computers develop superhuman intelligence and destroy the human race — and there are also thinkers who think this kind of scenario is a real danger.</p> \n<p>We interviewed one of them, Oxford philosopher <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/8/19/6031367/oxford-nick-bostrom-artificial-intelligence-superintelligence"">Nick Bostrom</a>, last year. Others include <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity"">singularity</a> theorist <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Kurzweil"">Ray Kurzweil</a> and <a href=""http://hanson.gmu.edu/"">Robin Hanson</a>, an economist at George Mason University.</p> \n<p>But these thinkers overestimate the likelihood that we'll have computers as smart as human beings and exaggerate the danger that such computers would pose to the human race. In reality, the development of intelligent machines is likely to be a slow and gradual process, and computers with superhuman intelligence, if they ever exist, will need us at least as much as we need them. Here's why.</p> \n<h3>1) Genuine intelligence requires a lot of practical experience</h3> \n<p><chorus-asset data-id=""666684"" class=""chorus-snippet browser_wide_media""> <img src=""http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/666684/14000957_3713491d60_b.0.jpg"" class=""small"" alt=""Chinese textbooks""> </chorus-asset></p> \n<p class=""caption"">(<a href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/drift-words/14000957/in/photolist-2i5PFo-2eKZP-9sV5Jd-49XE1C-bmCtQB-49Yew7-49Yfnj-4WSc96-5EYooj-hhQYY-77njVR-7wYxuz-oC1he5-6WZedD-49Yaf9-bhjAND-8YkE68-qHJ3t-8YkDxz-79hHtN"">Matt</a>)</p> \n<p><span>Bostrom, Kurzweil, and other theorists of super-human intelligence have seemingly infinite faith in the power of raw computational power to solve almost any intellectual problem. Yet in many cases, a shortage of intellectual horsepower isn't the real problem.</span></p> \n<p>To see why, imagine taking a brilliant English speaker who has never spoken a word of Chinese, locking her in a room with an enormous stack of books about the Chinese language, and asking her to become fluent in speaking Chinese. No matter how smart she is, how long she studies, and how many textbooks she has, she's not going to be able to learn enough to pass herself off as a native Chinese speaker.</p> \n<p>That's because an essential part of becoming fluent in a language is interacting with other fluent speakers. Talking to natives is the only way to learn local slang, discover subtle shades in <span>the meanings of words, and learn about social conventions and popular conversation topics. In principle, all of these things could be written down in a textbook, but in practice most of them aren't — in part because they vary so much from place to place and over time.</span></p> \n<p>A machine trying to develop human-level intelligence faces a much more severe version of this same problem. A computer program has never grown up in a human family, fallen in love, been cold, hungry or tired, and so forth. In short, they lack a huge amount of the context that allows human beings to relate naturally to one another.</p> \n<p>And a similar point applies to lots of other problems intelligent machines might tackle, from drilling an oil well to helping people with their taxes. <span>Most of the information you need to solve hard problems isn't written down anywhere, so n</span><span>o amount of theoretical reasoning or number crunching, on its own, will get you to the right answers</span><span>. The only way to become an expert is by trying things and seeing if they work.</span></p> \n<p><span>And this is an inherently difficult thing to automate, since it requires conducting experiments and waiting to see how the world responds. Which means that scenarios where computers rapidly outpace human beings in knowledge and capabilities doesn't make sense — smart computers would have to do the same kind of slow, methodical experiments people do.</span></p> \n<h3>2) Machines are extremely dependent on humans</h3> \n<p><chorus-asset data-id=""666676"" class=""chorus-snippet browser_wide_media""> <img src=""http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/666676/7423982576_f49bb7c9ed_k.0.jpg"" class=""small"" alt=""Oil Rig""> </chorus-asset></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Machines need humans to help maintain complex machinery like oil rigs.

A modern economy consists of millions of different kinds of machines that perform a variety of specialized functions. While a growing number of these machines are automated to some extent, virtually all of them depend on humans to supply power and raw materials, repair them when they break, manufacture more when they wear out, and so forth.</p> \n<p>You might imagine humanity creating still more robots being created to perform these maintenance functions. But we're nowhere close to having this kind of general-purpose robot.</p> \n<p>Indeed, building such a robot might be impossible due to a problem of <span>infinite regress: robots capable of building, fixing, and supplying all the machines in the world would themselves be fantastically complex. Still more robots would be needed to service </span><i style=""line-height: 1.5;"">them</i><span>. Evolution solved this problem by starting with the cell, a relatively simple, self-replicating building block for all life. Today's robots don't have anything like that and (despite the </span><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engines_of_Creation"">dreams of some futurists</a><span>) are unlikely to any time soon.</span></p> \n<p>This means that, barring major breakthroughs in robotics or nanotechnology, machines are going to depend on humans for supplies, repairs, and other maintenance.

But that's a lot harder than it sounds.</p> \n<p>Digital computers are capable of emulating the behavior of other digital computers because computers function in a precisely-defined, deterministic way. To simulate a computer, you just have to carry out the sequence of instructions that the computer being modeled would perform.</p> \n<p>The human brain isn't like this at all. Neurons are complex analog systems whose behavior can't be modeled precisely the way digital circuits can. And even a slight imprecision in the way individual neurons are modeled can lead to a wildly inaccurate model for the brain as a whole.</p> \n<p>A good analogy here is <a href=""http://timothyblee.com/2011/01/13/emulation-simulation-and-the-human-brain/"">weather simulation</a>. Physicists have an excellent understanding of the behavior of individual air molecules. So you might think we could build a model of the earth's atmosphere that predicts the weather far into the future. But so far, weather simulation has proven to be a computationally intractable problem. Small errors in early steps of the simulation snowball into large errors in later steps. Despite huge increases in computing power over the last couple of decades, we've only made modest progress in being able to predict future weather patterns.</p> \n<p>Simulating a brain precisely enough to produce intelligence is a much harder problem than simulating a planet's weather patterns. There's no reason to think scientists will be able to do it in the foreseeable future.</p> \n<h3>4) To get power, relationships are more important than intelligence</h3> \n<p><chorus-asset data-id=""666698"" class=""chorus-snippet browser_wide_media""> <img src=""http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/666698/obama-w-4-predecessors.0.jpg"" class=""small"" alt=""Presidents""> </chorus-asset></p> \n<p class=""caption"">(White House)</p> \n<p>Bostrom suggests that intelligent machines could ""become extremely powerful to the point of being able to shape the future according to its preferences."" But if we think about how human societies work, it's obvious that intelligence by itself isn't sufficient to become powerful.</p> \n<p>If it were, societies would be run by their scientists, philosophers, or chess prodigies. Instead, America — like most societies around the world — is run by men like Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton, and George W. Bush. These men became powerful not because they were unusually bright, but because they were well-connected, charismatic, and knew how to offer the right combination of carrots and sticks to get others to do their bidding.</p> \n<p>It's true that brilliant scientists have played an important role in creating powerful technologies such as the atomic bomb. And it's conceivable that a super intelligent computer would conceive of similar breakthroughs. But building new technologies and putting them into practice usually requires a lot of cash and manpower, which only powerful institutions like governments and large corporations can muster. The scientists who designed the atomic bomb needed Franklin Roosevelt to fund it.</p> \n<p>The same point applies to intelligent computers. Any plausible plan for taking over the world would require the cooperation of thousands of people. There's no reason to think a computer would be any more effective at enlisting their assistance for an evil plot than a human scientist would be. Indeed, given that persuasion often depends on long-standing friendships, in-group loyalties, and charisma, a disembodied, friendless computer program would be at a huge disadvantage.</p> \n<p>A similar point applies to the ""singularly,"" Ray Kurzweil's idea that computers will someday become so intelligent that humans will no longer even be able to understand what they're doing. The most powerful ideas aren't ones that only their inventor can understand. Rather, powerful ideas are ones that can be widely understood and adopted by many people, multiplying their effect on the world. That will be as true of computer-generated ideas as it is of ideas generated by people. To change the world, a super-intelligent computer would need to bring the human race along with it.</p> \n<h3>5) The more intelligence there is in the world, the less valuable it will become</h3> \n<p><chorus-asset data-id=""666702"" class=""chorus-snippet browser_wide_media""> <img src=""http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/666702/11235762823_3abf39ab21_k.0.jpg"" class=""small"" alt=""Smartphone""> </chorus-asset></p> \n<p>You might expect that computers will use their superior intelligence to become fabulously wealthy and then use their vast wealth to bribe humans into doing their bidding. <span>But this ignores an important economic principle: as a resource grows more abundant, its value falls.</span></p> \n<p><span>Sixty years ago, it cost millions of dollars to buy a computer that could do less than a modern smartphone. Today's computers can do vastly more than earlier generations, but the value of computing power has fallen even faster than computers' capabilities have improved.</span></p> \n<p>So the first super-intelligent computer might be able to earn a lot of money, but its advantage will be fleeting. As computer chips continue getting cheaper and more powerful, people will build more and more super-intelligent computers. The unique capabilities of super-intelligent computers, whatever those turn out to be, will become commodities.</p> \n<p>In a world of abundant intelligence, the most valuable resources will be those that are naturally limited, like land, energy, and minerals. Since those resources are controlled by human beings, we'll have at least as much leverage over intelligent computers as they'll have over us.</p>",Business & Finance
An interactive guide to finding your best student loan repayment option,http://www.vox.com/2014/10/1/6050243/student-loan-repayment-options,Here's how to figure out which of the federal plans makes the most sense for you.,"<p>It's that time of year: students who graduated this spring are about to start paying back their federal student loan bills. To pick the best repayment plan, you have to think about a lot of things — including the field you're working in and how you expect your salary to change in the next 10 years.</p> \n<p>A great place to start is the Education Department's <a href=""https://studentloans.gov/myDirectLoan/mobile/repayment/repaymentEstimator.action#view-repayment-plans"">repayment estimator</a>. This pulls in information on your student loans to tell you what your payment will be under different plans. But it doesn't tell you how the career you pursue might affect those payments in the long run. <span>Here are a few of the things you should be considering, and how they might affect what plan is best for you.

The chain might seem precise, but it really isn't: researchers have determined that it has a roughly <a style=""line-height: 1.5; background-color: #ffffff;"" href=""http://riebecca.blogspot.com/2007/10/adventures-in-measurement.html"" target=""_blank"">six-inch margin of error</a>, largely due to human error in placing the ball and perfectly aligning the sideline chain with it afterward.</p> \n<p><span>Engineers at NC State and Carnegie Mellon think the</span><span> </span><a style=""line-height: 1.5; background-color: #ffffff;"" href=""http://rickettslab.org/research/magneto-track/"" target=""_blank"">Magneto-Track System</a> is the answer. The system involves<span> a football with a magnetic transmitter built in, coupled with a series of sideline antennas. Together, they can indicate the position and </span><span>orientation of the ball, even when it's surrounded by the bodies of players.</span></p> \n<p><span></span>So far, it's been used in practice by the <span>NC State and Carnegie Mellon football teams. It's still not quite as accurate as the chain — it has an estimated one-foot margin of error — but engineers are improving it. </span></p> \n<p><span>They envision this initially as a way to enhance the viewing experience for people watching on TV — but it's possible that it could eventually consign the chain to the dustbin of football history.</span></p> \n<h3>How the ball works</h3> \n<p>Some other sports — <a href=""http://gizmodo.com/5923705/soccers-new-ball-tracking-technology-should-be-used-in-every-sport"" target=""_blank"">such as soccer</a> — have already implemented ball-tracking technologies that <a href=""http://motherboard.vice.com/read/goal-line-technology-will-settle-world-cup-scores"" target=""_blank"">rely on cameras</a>. <span>But (American) football is a particularly difficult case because much of the time, players' bodies are blocking the ball from view. This is especially true for many of the plays that would benefit from ball-tracking, like pileups right at the goal line.</span></p> \n<p>This would also prevent the use of RFID or GPS technologies. ""We had to look for a technology that would allow us to use radio waves that would be transparent to players' bodies,""<span> says David Ricketts, an NC State researcher working on the project. ""That led us to magnetic fields. They're safe, and transparent: </span><span>in a pileup, we can see straight through 22 players.""</span></p> \n<p><iframe width=""653"" height=""480"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/kqVMqqVTJ1A?rel=0"" frameborder=""0""></iframe></p> \n<p>The ball's transmitter generates a magnetic field, which is picked up by a series of antennas edging the field. <span>Based on the signals received by each antenna, they can </span><span>calculate the ball's position in three dimensions, along with its orientation, in a process similar to </span><a target=""_blank"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangulation"">triangulation</a><span>.</span></p> \n<p>The system can calculate all this in real-time — so, theoretically, it could supplement instant replay as a way for a ref to determine whether the ball crossed the goal line before a player's knee hit the ground.</p> \n<p>The main problem: right now, it still has a <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01gKdWCC3_Q"" style=""line-height: 1.5;"">one-foot margin of error</a>, which is larger than the chain's. But the researchers are working to cut down on it, and it could soon become the most accurate way to figure out if a player got a first down or scored a touchdown.</p> \n<h3><span>Does this affect the ball?</span></h3> \n<p>One concern might be that putting a magnetic transmitter in a football would alter its weight or balance. But when it comes to weight, a football is surprisingly forgiving.</p> \n<p><span>""What most people don't realize is that the footballs are handmade, so there's quite a bit of variation from one ball to another — about an ounce of difference,"" Ricketts says. </span><span>""So we designed our transmitter to be less than that natural variation."" </span><span>(There's less tolerance for variation in air pressure, as the </span><a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/1/21/7866121/deflated-football-patriots-cheating"" style=""font-size: 17px; line-height: 28.4624996185303px; background-color: #ffffff;"">Deflate-gate scandal</a><span> has taught us.)</span></p> \n<p>Additionally, footballs are naturally lopsided because of the laces, so manufacturers already need to put a small weight on the side <span>opposite them to balance things out. That provides a natural spot for the transmitter.</span></p> \n<p>Here's a video of a transmitter being put into a finished ball — but keep in mind that if this type of system were adopted, it could be incorporated into the actual manufacturing process.</p> \n<p><iframe frameborder=""0"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/B-pl4y1iqlg?rel=0"" height=""480"" width=""653""></iframe></p> \n<h3>Could this actually be used in games?</h3> \n<p>The engineers developed this <a href=""http://www.disneyresearch.com/project/magnetoquasistatic-position-and-orientation-tracking-2/"" target=""_blank"">using funding from Disney Research</a>. Not coincidentally, Disney owns ESPN. The researchers initially envisioned this simply as a way to let TV viewers <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RTKrtskTlqI"" target=""_blank"">more easily see the ball</a> at home, like the <a href=""http://www.slate.com/articles/sports/sports_nut/2014/01/foxtrax_glowing_puck_was_it_the_worst_blunder_in_tv_sports_history_or_was.html"" target=""_blank"">NHL's infamous glowing puck</a> experiment during the 90's.</p> \n<p>But it could have other uses.

It might even someday supplant replace the chain — and NFL officials <a style=""line-height: 1.5;"" href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/01/sports/football/01chains.html?pagewanted=all"" target=""_blank"">have even admitted</a> that they'd like a more precise replacement for it.</p> \n<p>This isn't the first one imagined: inventors have suggested all sorts of contraptions, including, most recently, <a href=""http://motherboard.vice.com/blog/why-havent-lasers-replaced-the-nfls-first-down-markers"" target=""_blank"">first down markers with lasers built in</a>. But these only solve part of the problem — they would enable refs to line up the markers accurately with the ball, but wouldn't help them better determine exactly where a player actually went down. <span>This magnetic tracking system would. </span></p> \n<p>Sure, the NFL can sometimes prefer to stick with tradition. But it's also shown a willingness to adopt technology when it can obviously improve the game.</p> \n<p>In 1986, the league adopted instant replay review, then abandoned it in 1989 <a href=""http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1666250-the-history-of-instant-replay-in-the-nfl"" target=""_blank"">due to complaints that it slowed the game down</a>, and that even when they used it, refs still got calls wrong. But in 1999, it tried out replay once again, this time with vastly improved cameras.</p> \n<p>It's since become a core part of football, and this year, the NFL <a href=""http://mmqb.si.com/2014/09/01/nfl-instant-replay-review-changes-mailbag/"" target=""_blank"">implemented a new system</a> with an even bigger shift: it now gives officials sitting in its New York offices a good deal of power over calls, rather than solely the refs on the field.</p> \n<p>Obviously, this magnetic system needs to improve further before it's even a possibility. But here's hoping that if the NFL still exists in 50 years, it's not still having refs run out onto the field with a chain.</p>",Business & Finance

The greatest trick capitalism ever pulled was making you want a pumpkin spice latte,http://www.vox.com/2014/9/10/6126359/pumpkin-spice-latte-starbucks-season-trend,"In 2013, Americans spent $308 million on pumpkin-flavored products.","<p>In 2013, Americans spent $308 million on pumpkin-flavored products. Pumpkin-flavored beer, pumpkin-flavored creamer, pumpkin breads, pumpkin ice cream, pumpkin yogurt, pumpkin cream cheese, and pumpkin cider peppered the shelves of grocery stores around this great country.</p> \n<p>But the crown jewel of this pumpkin berserker rage is what's known as the pumpkin spice latte, an unctuous, pungent, saccharine brown liquid, equal parts dairy and diabetes, served in paper cups and guzzled down by the liters.</p> \n<p>The popularity of this drink, concocted by Starbucks in 2003, has single-handedly ushered in a new wave of imitators, pumpkin-spiced food objects like Oreos and the rumored <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/09/08/not-coming-to-a-store-near-you-the-pumpkin-spice-condom/"">pumpkin-spiced condom</a> (despite reports, <a href=""http://www.buzzfeed.com/rachelzarrell/pumpkin-spice-condoms-are-a-sad-lie?bftw=main"">Durex</a> isn't actually making this condom). At this point, we've reached peak pumpkin-spice and it might be as good a time as any to examine how we got to this point and where we go from here:</p> \n<h3><span>Is there pumpkin in a pumpkin spice latte?</span></h3> \n<p>No. What you get when you order a pumpkin spice latte at Starbucks is espresso, water, whipped cream, milk (or soy milk), pumpkin spice,<b> </b>and, in addition, something called ""pumpkin sauce.""</p> \n<div class=""align-right""><chorus-asset class=""chorus-snippet browser_wide_media"" data-id=""692388""> <img alt=""PSL"" class=""small"" src=""http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/692388/Screen_Shot_2014-09-10_at_11.10.06_AM.0.png""></chorus-asset></div> \n<p><span></span>According to <a href=""http://store.starbucks.com/fontana-pumpkin-sauce/011008514,default,pd.html"">Starbucks' online store</a>, the ingredients for pumpkin sauce include sugar, condensed nonfat milk, high fructose corn syrup, annatto (a <a href=""http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/what-the-heck-do-i-do-with-annatto-176177343/?no-ist"">seed</a> that produces a caramel, orangeish color), natural and artificial flavors, caramel color, salt, and a preservative called potassium sorbate.</p> \n<p>So, when you're savoring your 49 grams of sugar (more than a can of regular soda) and 380 calories in a PSL (grande sized with whipped cream), the flavors you might be associating with pumpkin are actually a blend of spices like cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, and allspice — the kind of spices you'd use in a pumpkin pie.</p> \n<h3>So those spices are the real stars of the pumpkin spice latte?</h3> \n<p>Right.

And in that time between, the coffee maker has figured out a brilliant marketing scheme to get people interested — it's a combination of treating the drink's debut like a premiere and making the drink scarce by only offering it during a ""season.""</p> \n<p>This ""season"" is a mirage. Cinnamon, nutmeg, and allspice are available year-round. But like a McRib, the forced scarcity makes the PSL feel like a fleeting object and something that should be consumed before time expires.</p> \n<p>But Starbucks isn't the only driving force behind pumpkin spice domination. Some think there are cultural forces and economic forces too. ""Pumpkin became recognized as part of the comfort food trend during the recession in 2008,"" Suzy Badaracco, a certified chef who runs a company <a href=""http://www.culinarytides.com/index.html"">called Culinary Tides</a>, which forecasts and analyzes food trends, told me.</p> \n<p><span>""A</span><span>s we went into recovery, it ricocheted beyond bakery and pie and into beverage, </span>milkshake, energy bars, and as a more legit side dish and soup ingredient.

In November of 2009, Americans weren't buying as much fresh produce as they were before. <a href=""http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/chi-sat-trading-downjan24-story.html"">The Chicago Tribune</a> explained that in times of economic distress, people gravitate toward comfort foods because of the good memories the dishes conjure up.</p> \n<p>Foods like <a href=""http://www.telegraph.co.uk/foodanddrink/foodanddrinknews/8520274/Biscuit-sales-soar-as-recession-drives-people-to-comfort-food.html"" style=""line-height: 1.5;"">biscuits</a> and dishes like <a href=""http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=99188114"" style=""line-height: 1.5;"">spaghetti and meatballs</a> enjoyed popularity during the 2008 recession. <span>Pumpkin and pumpkin spices, of course, make many think of Thanksgiving and holidays. </span></p> \n<p>In addition to the comfort food trend, Badaracco also explained that pumpkin flavors tie in to concurring trends like the rise of heritage meats (bison, rabbit, duck, etc.), the heirloom vegetable trend, and the Native American cuisine trend.</p> \n<p>""The more trends <span>something has cross ties too, the more successful it will be and the longer life cycle it will have,"" she explained. </span></p> \n<p>Another reason we're seeing a growth in pumpkin popularity has to do with the business of <a href=""http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/10_39/b4196080854097.htm"">flavor forecasting</a>. Flavor forecasting is a practice where teams at companies like McCormick leverage their product knowledge (spices) to tell restaurants and businesses what types of flavors they think will be a hit in the next season or two.</p> \n<p>David Sax, author of <a href=""http://tastemakersbook.com/"">The Tastemakers</a>, a book about the industry and complexity of food trends, specifically points to a<a href=""http://www.mccormickforchefs.com/News/~/media/McCormick%20for%20Chefs/Files/Flavor%20Forecast%20PDF.ashx""> 2010 flavor forecast</a> by McCormick that spotlighted pumpkin spice as a holiday flavor.</p> \n<p>""They're the biggest flavor and spice company in the world. They do [the flavor forecast] as an exercise in PR, and it eventually filters down in sales,"" he said, explaining that this flavor forecast goes out to big companies to help them decide what products to make and that McCormick benefits from companies wanting to cash in on pumpkin spice.</p> \n<p>Big companies will usually consider McCormick's presentations because each sandwich, drink, or dessert is a major investment worth millions of dollars. And taking McCormick's advice could pay off.</p> \n<p>""All of these big companies are looking to mitigate risk. They're wagering millions of dollars in each product launch,"" Sax said, explaining why McCormick's flavor forecast is seen as helpful.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""right""><span>""Pumpkin became recognized as part of the comfort food trend during the recession in 2008.""</span></q></p> \n<p>The food industry isn't the only one that operates in this way.

They've stuck to the talking point of over 200 million drinks sold since its inception. At $4 a drink, that's a lot of money being driven toward pumpkin.</p> \n<p>But Starbucks isn't the only benchmark. There are also alcoholic beverages, baking mixes, bread, milk, ice cream, and pie filling.

Your new Apple Watch isnâ€™t going to make you exercise more,http://www.vox.com/2014/9/10/6128193/will-the-new-apple-watch-improve-your-health-wearable-technology,Researchers are skeptical that the new gadget will spur lasting behavior change.,"<p>Apple has self-declared a revolution in technology with the <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/9/9/6127087/what-you-need-to-know-about-the-new-apple-watch"">Apple Watch</a>, promising that the new fitness tracker will ""help us all stay fit throughout the day,"" as Apple chief executive Tim Cook put it when the watch was first unveiled. <br><br>The Apple Watch monitors and displays your heart rate, how much activity you've done, and how many calories you've burned. All of this information — and data from your other health apps — feeds into a new Apple platform called HealthKit, which acts like a dashboard of personal health information.<span><br><br>The Apple Watch certainly makes analyzing data easier, and it may even be more precise than other wearable technologies. HealthKit data will also be made available to researchers for analysis through a new platform called <a href=""http://www.theverge.com/2015/3/9/8176271/researchkit-apple-iphone-users-medical-trial"" target=""_blank"">ResearchKit</a>.</span><br><br>The tech company is promising this will amount to an Apple-shaped health revolution. ""Apple Watch gives us the ability to motivate people to be more active  and more healthy,"" Cook declared last year.<span></span><span> <br><br>But the claims deserve some scrutiny: </span>the <a href=""http://endeavourpartners.net/assets/Wearables-and-the-Science-of-Human-Behavior-Change-EP4.pdf"">evidence</a> on existing wearables suggests that — as with all other silver-bullet solutions for health — we haven't yet figured out how to make behavior change stick. Scientists are also skeptical about how helpful ResearchKit will actually be in the sea of big data about health.</p> \n<h3>Will the Apple Watch make people healthier?</h3> \n<p>Natasha Dow Schüll, an MIT anthropologist who has been studying the science of self-tracking and behavior change for her forthcoming book <i>Keeping Track,</i> told Vox, ""Even with the automated devices that just track you, like Jawbone and Fitbit, usually you still have to do something to keep using it — making sure to wear the thing, recharging it — and reports have shown there's a drop-off in use after about two months.""</p> \n<p>As <a href=""http://endeavourpartners.net/assets/Wearables-and-the-Science-of-Human-Behavior-Change-EP4.pdf"">this study</a> of behavior change and wearables found, the ""dirty secret"" about these devices is that they ""fail to drive long-term sustained engagement for a majority of users."" After a few months, the novelty wears off, excitement wanes, and people are back to their old ways — if they ever changed them to begin with. <span><br></span></p> \n<p>Those who use the devices religiously over the longer term tend to be health-focused already. Wearables are just another tool in their already well-stacked fitness arsenal.</p> \n<div class=""align-right""> \n<p><chorus-asset data-id=""692084"" class=""chorus-snippet browser_wide_media""> <img src=""http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/692084/494842661.0.jpg"" class=""small"" alt=""fitbit""> </chorus-asset></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Fitbit. (Photo courtesy of <a href=""http://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/typing-on-laptop-wearing-a-fitbit-news-photo/494842661"">Mark Cacovic/Moment Mobil</a>)</p> \n</div> \n<p>When modest changes are recorded as a result of tracking, <span>Schüll</span> added, it's difficult to untangle whether the devices are having an impact or whether it's just the fact that by collecting data, people are paying more attention to what they're doing with their bodies.</p> \n<p>Consider a <a href=""http://www.pewinternet.org/2013/01/28/tracking-for-health/"">2013 Pew survey</a> that found that Americans with chronic conditions like diabetes are more likely to track their health indicators (diet, weight) and report that it helps them  maintain their health. But they didn't necessarily use gadgetry. Just the act of tracking — even in their heads — was helpful.</p> \n<p>""Everyone agrees that the metrics are good and getting better, the algorithms for analyzing the behavior are better,"" <span>Schüll summed up. ""</span>But the sticking point continues to be habit and behavior change, and how you do that.""</p> \n<h3>Everyone is searching for the holy grail of behavior change</h3> \n<p>Even so, a cottage industry has emerged of ""habit pundits"" or ""behavior design"" experts who mix motivational psychology with behavioral wisdom.</p> \n<p>They're leading an effort to try to design technologies that respond to specific personality types in the hopes of inspiring lasting change. ""Social butterflies will respond if they're in a community where they'll get pressure or kudos,"" <span>Schüll</span> said. ""Others are introverts who find intrinsic satisfaction in looking at their data. People are struggling to come up with the way forward.""</p> \n<p>In time, these folks may be able to figure out how wearable tracking devices can improve the health of every user. And just because the devices that exist so far haven't been shown to be super helpful doesn't mean they don't have potential, said Schüll. Maybe the new Apple Watch, with its customizable interface and personalized designs, will be a step in the right direction. Maybe Apple will offer more effective prompts and nudges that could do  the trick. ""But the technology is so new that we just don't know yet  what's going to happen with it.""</p> \n<p>For now, applying common sense is probably useful: for centuries, everyone — not just those who can afford the latest Apple gadgets — has had access to other, less sexy technologies (scales, measuring tapes)  that provide extremely accurate and predictive data about your  health (weight, the measure of your waist), and those haven't spurred  behavior change or reversed the trajectory of the obesity crisis in America.</p> \n<h3>The promise of ResearchKit</h3> \n<p>ResearchKit may be more promising for researchers than the HealthKit will be for consumers. <br><br>Essentially, ResearchKit includes disease-specific apps that allow patients to track their symptoms and opt to share that data with research partners such as the Dana-Farber Cancer  Institute, University of Oxford, and Stanford Medicine.</p> \n<p>The open-source platform will also allow researchers to find potential participants for their studies and view the other health data generated by Apple users, such as details about diet and exercise habits,  blood pressure, and weight.</p> \n<p>""It's part of a larger move toward greater democratization of  data,"" said Dr. <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/ashish-jha/"">Ashish Jha</a>, a researcher and physician at Harvard, ""and will allow researchers to much better understand what is  actually going on with patients during the 99.9 percent of their lives when  they are not interacting with the health-care system.""</p> \n<p>But Jha also questioned how easy it would be to access the data and what impact, if any, it will have on patient care. ""One  big question is whether electronic health record systems, which tend to be closed, will  allow for providers and patients to link up the patient-generated data  with more formal clinical data in ways that will be useful for  patient care.""<br><br>Dr. <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.badscience.net/"">Ben Goldacre</a>, an author and physician-epidemiologist who has called for the more widespread use of such data to drive health care, noted that Apple's data set is just one of many available right now, and that we're not always great at harnessing the information deluge for health.<br><br>""Big data is very much in vogue right now. In medicine, this often  means: very large, very noisy datasets, riddled with biases, on  unrepresentative populations,"" he wrote in an email.<br><br>""Depending on the research question, that  can be useful, and fun, alongside smaller datasets of higher quality,  and it'll be interesting to see what Apple collect. But we should  remember that bigger isn't always automatically better.""</p> \n<hr> \n<p><b>Correction:</b> A previous version of this story incorrectly stated when Apple would begin selling the watch.</p>",Business & Finance

Many Scandinavian and Western European nations save far more, with Switzerland coming out on top at 13.1 percent. As for why Americans save so little, that's more complicated. For many Americans, it is simply that they aren't earning enough money to pay basic expenses and save at the same time.

In addition, net price has risen much more slowly at private than at public schools (though private schools are still much more expensive, on average).

The cost of childcare has outstripped the broader consumer price index for all items in the last 20 years, rising at nearly double the rate. Some economists think this growth in childcare might contribute to the downtick in women's labor force participation rate — as childcare costs go up, some women may find it costs less to stay home and let their spouses work rather than pay for daycare and work at the same time. That means the cost of childcare could contribute to the gender wage gap.

Almost anything you own these days is the result of a complicated web of global interactions. And there's no better way to depict those interactions and the social and political circumstances that give rise to them than with a map or two. Or in our case, 38. These maps are our favorite way to illustrate the major economic themes facing the world today. Some of them focus on the big picture while others illustrate finer details. The overall portrait that emerges is of a world that's more closely linked than ever before, but still riven by enormous geography-driven differences.  <div class=""body center""></div> \n<div class=""feature-body"">\n<ol class=""vox-feature-list""> \n<li class=""list-0 clearfix""> \n<h4 class=""hide-at-large"">World GDP per capita</h4> \n<div class=""vox-feature-photo vox-feature-column""> \n<div class=""vox-photo-hack"">\n<a href=""http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/664686/Gdpercapita.0.PNG"" target=""_black""><img class=""lazy zoom"" data-src=""http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/664686/Gdpercapita.0.PNG""></a> <a href=""http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/664686/Gdpercapita.0.PNG"" target=""_blank"" class=""icon-link-ext-alt""></a>\n</div> \n<p class=""caption""><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_(PPP)_per_capita#mediaviewer/File:Gdpercapita.PNG"">Quandapanda</a></p> \n</div> \n<div class=""vox-feature-story vox-feature-column""> \n<h4 class=""show-at-large"">World GDP per capita</h4> \n<p><a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/gdp-economic-output"">GDP</a> per capita isn't a perfect proxy for living standards (it doesn't consider inequality, for example, or the fact that the weather is way nicer in Spain than Denmark), but it's the best quick summary measure of economic capacity that we have.

But the two largest-population countries, China and India, are much poorer than that, and the very poorest countries are largely clustered in Africa.

The map plots the center point in three-dimensional space, which renders the north-south aspect somewhat less interesting, but the east-west movement over time is fascinating. A thousand years ago, economic activity was centered near the middle of the Eurasian landmass. By the early 20th century, the Industrial Revolution in Europe and the growth of the United States pulled the center way to the west. But since 1980 or so, Asia has been growing faster than the US and Europe and dragging the middle back to where it was centuries ago. By 2025, McKinsey thinks the global economy will once again be balanced around the middle of Eurasia.</p> \n</div> \n</li> \n<li class=""list-2 clearfix""> \n<h4 class=""hide-at-large"">World light map</h4> \n<div class=""vox-feature-photo vox-feature-column""> \n<div class=""vox-photo-hack"">\n<a href=""http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/663570/dnb_land_ocean_ice.2012.3600x1800.0.jpg"" target=""_black""><img class=""lazy zoom"" data-src=""http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/663570/dnb_land_ocean_ice.2012.3600x1800.0.jpg""></a> <a href=""http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/663570/dnb_land_ocean_ice.2012.3600x1800.0.jpg"" target=""_blank"" class=""icon-link-ext-alt""></a>\n</div> \n<p class=""caption""><a href=""http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/NightLights/page3.php"">NASA earth observatory</a></p> \n</div> \n<div class=""vox-feature-story vox-feature-column""> \n<h4 class=""show-at-large"">World light map</h4> \n<p>Economic activity is abstract and, in many ways, hard to measure precisely.

Observe the thick cluster of the US Northeastern Megalopolis and the even bigger cluster in northwestern Europe. In poorer regions, however, the map represents not just population density but also the actual availability of electrical lighting.

As revealed by this map, it's also a product of America's cumbersome political system, characterized by a mixture of crass dealmaking and status quo bias. At its founding before World War One, the Fed was divided into 12 geographically defined districts, and the apportionment of the country has never been revisited. Consequently, the enormous 12th District covers everything west of the Rockies, while the 3rd and 4th Districts cover relatively tiny slices of the northeast. Meanwhile, the state of Missouri contains two different Federal Reserve banks, because a Missouri senator was important to getting the bill through Congress.</p> \n</div> \n</li> \n<li class=""list-5 clearfix""> \n<h4 class=""hide-at-large"">Korea at night</h4> \n<div class=""vox-feature-photo vox-feature-column""> \n<div class=""vox-photo-hack"">\n<a href=""http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/664064/korea_vir_2012268_1.0.jpg"" target=""_black""><img class=""lazy zoom"" data-src=""http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/664064/korea_vir_2012268_1.0.jpg""></a> <a href=""http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/664064/korea_vir_2012268_1.0.jpg"" target=""_blank"" class=""icon-link-ext-alt""></a>\n</div> \n<p class=""caption""><a href=""http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/NaturalHazards/view.php?id=79796"">NASA Earth observatory</a></p> \n</div> \n<div class=""vox-feature-story vox-feature-column""> \n<h4 class=""show-at-large"">Korea at night</h4> \n<p>Another look at the earth at night, this time zoomed in on the Korean peninsula.

The northern and southern portions of the peninsula have a largely shared history, language, culture, cuisine, and ethnic identity. But since the conclusion of the Korean War in the early 1950s, they've pursued very different institutional courses. Consequently, the south is lit brightly at night, with crowded, prosperous cities.

Leo Mirani's map of countries where mobile phone-based payment systems outnumber traditional banks underscores the point. Mobile phone infrastructure is actually simpler to build than traditional landline phones, so in most of Africa mobile phone penetration actually spread faster and further than traditional wireline phones. And because most Africans never had access to traditional bank accounts, there are no powerful incumbent interests keeping people locked in them. Almost everyone thinks the mobile payments revolution will come to America someday, but it's already arrived in much of Africa and will come to dominate that continent before any other.</p> \n</div> \n</li> \n<li class=""list-8 clearfix""> \n<h4 class=""hide-at-large"">The deep ties between Europe and Russia</h4> \n<div class=""vox-feature-photo vox-feature-column""> \n<div class=""vox-photo-hack"">\n<a href=""http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/666524/Major_russian_gas_pipelines_to_europe.0.png"" target=""_black""><img class=""lazy zoom"" data-src=""http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/666524/Major_russian_gas_pipelines_to_europe.0.png""></a> <a href=""http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/666524/Major_russian_gas_pipelines_to_europe.0.png"" target=""_blank"" class=""icon-link-ext-alt""></a>\n</div> \n<p class=""caption""><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia%E2%80%93Ukraine_gas_disputes#mediaviewer/File:Major_russian_gas_pipelines_to_europe.png"">Samuel Bailey</a></p> \n</div> \n<div class=""vox-feature-story vox-feature-column""> \n<h4 class=""show-at-large"">The deep ties between Europe and Russia</h4> \n<p>Russia and the European Union are locked into an intimate economic relationship by the web of gas pipelines depicted in this map by Samuel Bailey. On the one hand, without the gas that flows through these pipelines, many European countries — including Germany and Italy — would be bereft of energy resources. And yet as critical as Russian fuel imports are to Europe's energy mix, those very same exports are in a way even more critical to the Russian economy, as they offer a huge share of the country's foreign currency earnings. As events in Ukraine and elsewhere drive tensions between Moscow and Brussels, both sides remain locked into this energy trade by the basic geographical reality that gas can only flow where the pipelines go.</p> \n</div> \n</li> \n<hr> \n<h3>The sinews of trade</h3> \n<li class=""list-10 clearfix""> \n<h4 class=""hide-at-large"">How sugar circulates globally</h4> \n<div class=""vox-feature-photo vox-feature-column""> \n<div class=""vox-photo-hack"">\n<a href=""http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/663148/Screen_Shot_2014-08-19_at_10.58.57_AM.0.png"" target=""_black""><img class=""lazy zoom"" data-src=""http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/663148/Screen_Shot_2014-08-19_at_10.58.57_AM.0.png""></a> <a href=""http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/663148/Screen_Shot_2014-08-19_at_10.58.57_AM.0.png"" target=""_blank"" class=""icon-link-ext-alt""></a>\n</div> \n<p class=""caption""><a href=""http://saveoursugar.eu/index.php/sugar-trade-maps/"">Tate &amp; Lyle sugars</a></p> \n</div> \n<div class=""vox-feature-story vox-feature-column""> \n<h4 class=""show-at-large"">How sugar circulates globally</h4> \n<p>Sugar isn't necessarily the most important commodity in the world, but it is one of the most widely consumed and delicious. This map illustrates the global pattern of sugar imports and exports — a surprisingly complex web that reveals the ways in which the real-world pattern of global trade is considerably more tangled than a basic model of specialization and comparative advantage would suggest. On balance, of course, some regions import more sugar than they export and others are the reverse. But on a gross basis, all regions both import and export sugar, forming a complicated global supply chain. Public policy influences this dynamic. The United States imposes quotas on the total amount of sugar that can be imported from any given country — thus producing financial gains for America's beet sugar farmers. This prevents our domestic market from soaking up all of Latin America's considerable production and diverts much of it abroad to sugar-hungry markets that are less convenient to ship to.</p> \n</div> \n</li> \n<li class=""list-11 clearfix""> \n<h4 class=""hide-at-large"">World export map</h4> \n<div class=""vox-feature-photo vox-feature-column""> \n<div class=""vox-photo-hack"">\n<a href=""http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/664068/world-commodities-map_536bebb20436a.0.png"" target=""_black""><img class=""lazy zoom"" data-src=""http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/664068/world-commodities-map_536bebb20436a.0.png""></a> <a href=""http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/664068/world-commodities-map_536bebb20436a.0.png"" target=""_blank"" class=""icon-link-ext-alt""></a>\n</div> \n<p class=""caption""><a href=""http://thumbnails.visually.netdna-cdn.com/world-commodities-map_536bebb20436a.png"">Simran Khosla</a></p> \n</div> \n<div class=""vox-feature-story vox-feature-column""> \n<h4 class=""show-at-large"">World export map</h4> \n<p>This map from Simran Khosla charts each country's biggest export category, and also color-codes the categories into larger groups. Countries that depend on metal or mineral exports are typically quite poor, with the dominance of these sectors generally a tell-tale sign of a lack of any kind of sophisticated industrial base. There are, however, exceptions. Australia enjoys one of the world's highest living standards, notwithstanding a global trade balance driven by coal and other minerals, while copper-oriented Chile is Latin America's richest country. The black-colored oil exporters are an interestingly diverse group. The richest countries in the world — places like Norway and Qatar — fall into this category, but so does middle-income Russia and desperately poor Chad.</p> \n</div> \n</li> \n<div class=""chorus-snippet m-fishtank no-responsive-video""><chorus-ad data-ad-slot=""athena_features""></chorus-ad></div> \n<!--  ########  END SNIPPET  ########  --> \n<li class=""list-12 clearfix""> \n<h4 class=""hide-at-large"">Busiest container ports</h4> \n<div class=""vox-feature-photo vox-feature-column""> \n<div class=""vox-photo-hack"">\n<a href=""http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/663454/tumblr_mw4i1zKE0C1s3dn7vo1_1280.0.png"" target=""_black""><img class=""lazy zoom"" data-src=""http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/663454/tumblr_mw4i1zKE0C1s3dn7vo1_1280.0.png""></a> <a href=""http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/663454/tumblr_mw4i1zKE0C1s3dn7vo1_1280.0.png"" target=""_blank"" class=""icon-link-ext-alt""></a>\n</div> \n<p class=""caption""><a href=""http://vizual-statistix.tumblr.com/post/66724553145/in-august-i-mapped-the-busiest-air-travel-routes"">Seth Kadish</a></p> \n</div> \n<div class=""vox-feature-story vox-feature-column""> \n<h4 class=""show-at-large"">Busiest container ports</h4> \n<p>Seaports are a physical manifestation of the global trade of goods.

The heavy concentration of shipping activity on Asia's Pacific Coast is a striking symbol of both East Asia's enormous population and its outsized role in the global manufacturing sector. India and Africa, meanwhile, are visibly suffering from a chicken and egg problem of underdevelopment. They lack the kind of factory growth that would provide economic opporunities for their people and justify the creation of busy ports.

But what's really striking here are not the differences between countries, but what they have in common. With the exception of a handful of countries under trade sanctions or major wartime disruptions, trade has risen in significance for every country on the planet.

Trade as a share of world output fell precipitously during the two world wars, and Cold War politics kept it relatively low for most of the second half of the twentieth century. But over the past generation it's boomed, thanks to a combination of changed policies and the invention of the container shipping. Something the map highlights is that the world economy features a couple of major shipping choke points — one around Malaysia and Singapore and the other around the Red Sea — where geopolitical instability could produce major disruptions to commerce. At the moment, a de facto American monopoly on ability to sustain far-flung naval operations prevents this from happening, and it wouldn't really be in anyone's interest to massively interrupt world trade, anyway. Then again, World War I wasn't really in anyone's interest either.</p> \n</div> \n</li> \n<hr> \n<h3>A world of cities</h3> \n<li class=""list-16 clearfix""> \n<h4 class=""hide-at-large"">World's longest flights</h4> \n<div class=""vox-feature-photo vox-feature-column""> \n<div class=""vox-photo-hack"">\n<a href=""http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/663172/tumblr_n1zot9AsFt1s3dn7vo1_1280.0.png"" target=""_black""><img class=""lazy zoom"" data-src=""http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/663172/tumblr_n1zot9AsFt1s3dn7vo1_1280.0.png""></a> <a href=""http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/663172/tumblr_n1zot9AsFt1s3dn7vo1_1280.0.png"" target=""_blank"" class=""icon-link-ext-alt""></a>\n</div> \n<p class=""caption""><a href=""http://vizual-statistix.tumblr.com/post/78698912781/i-just-got-back-from-a-vacation-in-oceania-which"">Seth Kadish</a></p> \n</div> \n<div class=""vox-feature-story vox-feature-column""> \n<h4 class=""show-at-large"">World's longest flights</h4> \n<p>Air travel has been revolutionizing the world economy since its initial commercialization in the middle of the twentieth century.

Seth Kadish made this map illustrating the twenty longest routes with regular passenger service in the world today. Strikingly, four of the top 10 and six of the top 20 involve the relatively small city of Dubai in the United Arab Emirates, with nearby Doha, Qatar accounting for several more entries on the list. These Gulf states have invested heavily in building up their own national airlines to connect themselves to the global centers of commerce, and the airlines that have resulted are now transforming the aviation industry with low labor costs and a high standard of service.</p> \n</div> \n</li> \n<li class=""list-17 clearfix""> \n<h4 class=""hide-at-large"">Pearl River Delta Megacity</h4> \n<div class=""vox-feature-photo vox-feature-column""> \n<div class=""vox-photo-hack"">\n<a href=""http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/664128/pearl_river_large.0.jpg"" target=""_black""><img class=""lazy zoom"" data-src=""http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/664130/pearl_river_small.0.png""></a> <a href=""http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/664128/pearl_river_large.0.jpg"" target=""_blank"" class=""icon-link-ext-alt""></a>\n</div> \n<p class=""caption""><a href=""http://www.timeout.com.hk/big-smog/features/60965/the-pearl-river-delta-megacity.html"">Time Out Hong Kong</a></p> \n</div> \n<div class=""vox-feature-story vox-feature-column""> \n<h4 class=""show-at-large"">Pearl River Delta Megacity</h4> \n<p>Hong Kong and Macau, at opposite ends of the bay, formed where the Pearl River drains into the South China Sea, were, for decades, islands of foreign rule hovering on the edges of Maoist China. This left them substantially more prosperous than the Chinese mainland, and when China began its economic reforms in the 1980s, it was the area north of Hong Kong that led the way. As the foreign colonies have been partially reintegrated into China proper and the process of growth and reform has continued throughout the mainland, the broad arc from Hong Kong through Shenzhen into Dongguan, Guangzhou, Foshan, Zhongshan, and Macau has emerged as a key hub of global shipping and manufacturing. Ongoing growth of the mainland cities combined with the Chinese government's massive investments in transportation infrastructure are knitting the region together into what could soon emerge as a ""megacity"" — a gigantic, polycentric metropolitan area with over 100 million inhabitants.</p> \n</div> \n</li> \n<li class=""list-18 clearfix""> \n<h4 class=""hide-at-large"">Silicon Valley</h4> \n<div class=""vox-feature-photo vox-feature-column""> \n<div class=""vox-photo-hack"">\n<a href=""http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/assets/4465505/silicon_valley_big.png"" target=""_black""><img class=""lazy zoom"" data-src=""http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/assets/4465505/silicon_valley_big.png""></a> <a href=""http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/assets/4465505/silicon_valley_big.png"" target=""_blank"" class=""icon-link-ext-alt""></a>\n</div> \n<p class=""caption""><a href=""http://www.vox.com/a/internet-maps#list-23"">Tim Lee</a></p> \n</div> \n<div class=""vox-feature-story vox-feature-column""> \n<h4 class=""show-at-large"">Silicon Valley</h4> \n<p>California's Silicon Valley, the arc of towns stretching between San Jose in the south and San Francisco in the north, is the unofficial capital of the global computing industry. Far from making geography obsolete, the internet has in some ways made it more important than ever. The best engineering talent generally wants to live where the top employers of software engineers are located. And any company that wants to hire loads of top computer programmers needs to be present in the Valley to recruit them. Meanwhile, one major source of venture capital financing for new startups is rich tech company founders who've already cashed out. And regardless of origin, top VCs like to locate where both startups and potential buyers of young companies are thick on the ground — Silicon Valley. Yet, while past technological revolutions have led to explosive urban growth, the impact of the technology boom on the Valley has been different. Strict zoning rules have prevented the vast suburban areas from urbanizing, and already-dense San Francisco is resistant to becoming even denser. The result has been skyrocketing housing prices that have created windfalls for people who bought property at the right time but that make it difficult for working-class people to share in the Bay Area's growing prosperity.</p> \n</div> \n</li> \n<li class=""list-19 clearfix""> \n<h4 class=""hide-at-large"">Verkehrsverbund Rhein-Ruhr</h4> \n<div class=""vox-feature-photo vox-feature-column""> \n<div class=""vox-photo-hack"">\n<a href=""http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/664340/StadtbahnRR.0.png"" target=""_black""><img class=""lazy zoom"" data-src=""http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/664340/StadtbahnRR.0.png""></a> <a href=""http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/664340/StadtbahnRR.0.png"" target=""_blank"" class=""icon-link-ext-alt""></a>\n</div> \n<p class=""caption""><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verkehrsverbund_Rhein-Ruhr"">Sebastian Sothen via Wikimedia</a></p> \n</div> \n<div class=""vox-feature-story vox-feature-column""> \n<h4 class=""show-at-large"">Verkehrsverbund Rhein-Ruhr</h4> \n<p>Germany is Europe's largest economic power, and Berlin is Germany's largest city.

None of the constituent cities of Rhine-Ruhr are especially large, but together they make a metropolitan area that's 11 million strong and hosts 26 of Germany's 50 largest companies. Knitting it all together and making it all work is the complicated but efficient Verkehrsverbund Rhein-Ruhr, the region's mass transit system.

In an earlier age, a typical rich person might live on an estate surrounded by servants and farmers. In a city, the well-to-do might enjoy garden apartments while the poor crowded immediately upstairs in crammed walkups. But the car, the elevator, and the mechanization of farming have created a new geography of class around the world.

One key point here is that some countries you don't think of as major oil exporters — Brazil, for example — are actually playing an important role in the global supply chain. Another is that contrary to a lot of simplistic political rhetoric, the United States doesn't actually import much oil from Saudi Arabia or other Persian Gulf countries. We have a fair amount of domestic oil production, Canada and Mexico both export oil, and both the North Sea and western Africa are closer to us than is the Persian Gulf. The Gulf nonetheless matters to the United States, because its oil supplies matter so much to Europe, China, Japan, and India. Oil can be shipped pretty far and wide, so disruption to any major supplier-consumer relationship pushes up the global price of oil and puts a major damper on the living standards of highly oil-dependent societies such as ours.</p> \n</div> \n</li> \n<li class=""list-25 clearfix""> \n<h4 class=""hide-at-large"">World pigs map</h4> \n<div class=""vox-feature-photo vox-feature-column""> \n<div class=""vox-photo-hack"">\n<a href=""http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/664104/pigs_distribution.0.png"" target=""_black""><img class=""lazy zoom"" data-src=""http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/664104/pigs_distribution.0.png""></a> <a href=""http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/664104/pigs_distribution.0.png"" target=""_blank"" class=""icon-link-ext-alt""></a>\n</div> \n<p class=""caption""><a href=""http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi/10.1371/journal.pone.0096084#s3"">Robinson et. al</a></p> \n</div> \n<div class=""vox-feature-story vox-feature-column""> \n<h4 class=""show-at-large"">World pigs map</h4> \n<p>Timothy Robinson and his co-authors put together a series of maps showing the global distribution of various widely eaten animals.

Unfortunately, when you combine this traditional approach to property rights with state-of-the-art technology, you get a tragedy of the commons — everyone grabs as much fish as they can, and the long-term productivity of the fishery declines. This UN Environmental Program map of global fishing yields shows that we are pulling an awful lot of fish out of most coastal waters. At the same time, the average depth is falling as the most promising fisheries fall prey to overfishing. The good news is that policy solutions are available and, where implemented — <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/5/8/5669120/how-the-us-stopped-its-fisheries-from-collapsing"">as in many US fisheries</a> — they are working.</p> \n</div> \n</li> \n<li class=""list-27 clearfix""> \n<h4 class=""hide-at-large"">Shale oil/gas</h4> \n<div class=""vox-feature-photo vox-feature-column""> \n<div class=""vox-photo-hack"">\n<a href=""http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/assets/4884688/Screen_Shot_2014-08-10_at_8.00.17_PM.png"" target=""_black""><img class=""lazy zoom"" data-src=""http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/assets/4884688/Screen_Shot_2014-08-10_at_8.00.17_PM.png""></a> <a href=""http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/assets/4884688/Screen_Shot_2014-08-10_at_8.00.17_PM.png"" target=""_blank"" class=""icon-link-ext-alt""></a>\n</div> \n<p class=""caption""><a href=""http://www.eia.doe.gov/analysis/studies/worldshalegas/pdf/fullreport.pdf"">Energy Information Administration</a></p> \n</div> \n<div class=""vox-feature-story vox-feature-column""> \n<h4 class=""show-at-large"">Shale oil/gas</h4> \n<p>Shale oil and gas obtained through fracking and other new extraction techniques have transformed the regional economies in several different parts of the United States.

This, in turn, is a legacy of economic systems that existed centuries ago. Rice cultivation, popular in this region of the world, generates many more calories per acre than are yielded by traditional agricultural practices elsewhere. Modern technology means that the world's population no longer has to be distributed according to where rice is cultivated.

Given China's massive population it is in a sense surprising that Shanghai and Beijing are projected to stay clearly smaller than the world's very biggest cities.

Of course, we are also home to the world's largest overall economy. It's more instructive, in many ways, to compare countries that are similar in terms of overall GDP.

But though the numbers of the unvaccinated in countries like the United States are much lower, in a way that reveals a much more troubling policy failure. Here, the resources to vaccinate everyone are clearly present.

These kind of considerations are crucial to major global firms trying to understand where their biggest market opportunities are.

A handful of coastal Chinese cities are genuinely rich on a par with Gulf oil states. But most of coastal China is more middle-income, comparable to countries in Central Europe. Much of the interior, meanwhile, is still genuinely poor with living standards like what you would find in India, the poor parts of Central America, or, for some provinces, even in sub-Saharan Africa.

Both Brazil and China mix market economies with extensive government involvement, but China's public spending features a heavy tilt toward investments in infrastructure. Brazil spends more on civil service salaries and transfer payments.

As this map shows, open defecation is both very common across a large swath of India and also something that varies quite a bit from region to region. The problem is in part one of basic infrastructure. India is far from being the poorest country in the world, but it is home to approximately 60 percent of the world's toilet-less population. Given India's dense population, open defecation is a major public health problem, with feces inevitably contaminating drinking water. This leads to intestinal disease and contributes to India's high rate of child malnutrition. This malnutrition problem is more widespread than you would expect given India's income level and, by stunting kids' development, contributes to slower economic growth in the future. Finance Minister Arun Jaitley's budget calls for spending that will aim to eliminate open defecation by 2019, but achieving that goal will be challenging given the scale of the problem.</p> \n</div> \n</li> \n<li class=""list-41 clearfix""> \n<h4 class=""hide-at-large"">Alcohol consumption</h4> \n<div class=""vox-feature-photo vox-feature-column""> \n<div class=""vox-photo-hack"">\n<a href=""http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/assets/4876436/Screen_Shot_2014-08-08_at_4.45.06_PM.png"" target=""_black""><img class=""lazy zoom"" data-src=""http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/assets/4876436/Screen_Shot_2014-08-08_at_4.45.06_PM.png""></a> <a href=""http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/assets/4876436/Screen_Shot_2014-08-08_at_4.45.06_PM.png"" target=""_blank"" class=""icon-link-ext-alt""></a>\n</div> \n<p class=""caption""><a href=""http://www.who.int/substance_abuse/publications/en/"">WHO Global status report on alcohol and health</a></p> \n</div> \n<div class=""vox-feature-story vox-feature-column""> \n<h4 class=""show-at-large"">Alcohol consumption</h4> \n<p>This World Health Organization map reveals that heavy drinking is a true passion of eastern Europeans.

But the actual level of service provided by this network is relatively dismal. The map is also a way of illustrating some of the planet's vast relatively empty spaces — there's not much going on in eastern Russia or western China, even though both of these countries have plenty of infrastructure around their main population centers.</p> \n</div> \n</li> \n</ol> \n<div class=""chorus-snippet m-fishtank no-responsive-video""><chorus-ad data-ad-slot=""athena_features""></chorus-ad></div> \n<!--  ########  END SNIPPET  ########  -->\n</div> \n<div class=""link-fest clearfix""> \n<hr> \n<h3>Learn more</h3> \n<ul> \n<li> <a href=""http://www.vox.com/a/world-war-i-maps""> \n<div class=""link-hero"" style=""background-image: url( 'http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/assets/4607979/img029a.jpg' );""></div> \n<span>40 maps that explain World War One</span> </a> </li> \n<li> <a href=""http://www.vox.com/a/how-the-us-is-changing""> \n<div class=""link-hero"" style=""background-image: url( 'http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/assets/4299403/Screen_Shot_2014-04-14_at_6.00.55_PM.png' );""></div> \n<span>21 charts that explain how America is changing</span> </a> </li> \n<li> <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/8/19/5942585/40-maps-that-explain-the-roman-empire""> \n<div class=""link-hero"" style=""background-image: url( 'http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/667502/Augustus.0_cinema_1200.0.0.png' );""></div> \n<span>40 maps that explain the Roman Empire</span> </a> </li> \n</ul> \n</div> \n<p> \n<link href=""http://ea-cdn.voxmedia.com/production/vox-feature-builder-list-styles/stylesheets/styles.css"" media=""screen"" rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css""> \n<script type=""text/javascript"" src=""//cdn.jsdelivr.net/jquery.unveiljs/1.3.0/jquery.unveil.min.js""></script> \n<script src=""http://ea-cdn.voxmedia.com/production/vox-feature-builder-list-styles/javascripts/all.js"" type=""text/javascript""></script> \n</p>",Business & Finance
Nearly 17 million American adults don't have bank accounts. Here's one way they can buildÂ credit.,http://www.vox.com/2014/10/1/6875493/how-to-save-money-when-you-dont-have-a-bank-give-it-to-your-relatives,"Nearly 8 percent of American households live outside the banking system, but that doesn't mean they don't save or build credit.","<p>Let's say your bank disappeared tomorrow, and with it all of your credit cards and accounts. How would you save money or get a loan? There's the proverbial practice of stowing your money under your mattress. Or you could beg a parent or sibling for a loan so you could make your next rent payment.</p> \n<p>But many Americans have other, more organized ways outside the financial system to build up savings and credit. One of those is the rotating savings group. These go by different names — rotating savings and credit associations (<a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.phil.frb.org/community-development/publications/discussion-papers/discussionpaper-ROSCAs.pdf"">RoSCA</a>) is one way experts refer to it — but they are often informally called savings circles.</p> \n<h3>How does it work?</h3> \n<p>The concept is simple: you get together with a group of your most trusted family members or friends, and you all agree to pay $50 a week into the pot. If there are 8 of you, you will pay $50 in for 7 weeks, then get the full pot ($350, not counting your $50) one of those 8 weeks.  It puts behavioral economics to work for users — you don't want to let your relatives down and cause them to miss out on their lump sum this week.</p> \n<div class=""align-right"">\n<chorus-asset data-id=""2314794"" class=""chorus-snippet browser_wide_media""> <img src=""http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2314794/Screen_Shot_2014-09-30_at_5.58.47_PM.0.png"" class=""small"" alt=""Savings circle""></chorus-asset> \n<p class=""caption"">A diagram of how a savings circle works. (Source: <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.usfinancialdiaries.org/issue3-informal"" style=""line-height: 1.5;"">US Financial Diaries</a>)</p> \n</div> \n<p>Eight percent of American households are unbanked, according to the FDIC — that means that around 1 in 12 households doesn't have a checking or a savings account. And according to new research, the savings circle is one key way many Americans make ends meet.</p> \n<p>The US Financial Diaries Project, in which researchers from NYU and the Center for Financial Services Innovation (a New York-based nonprofit) closely followed the financial lives of 200 US families with low to moderate incomes, <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.usfinancialdiaries.org/issue3-informal"">found</a> that 9 percent of those households use circles. The households aren't a representative sample, but the findings do suggest that significant numbers of certain populations, like immigrants, make particularly heavy use of the circles.</p> \n<h3>What's the use of savings circles?</h3> \n<p>They solve one big problem lower-income Americans have: The researchers (and other studies) have found that these households often have troubles building up lump sums of savings, whether for short- or long-term use.</p> \n<p>The strategy isn't just for the unbanked, of course. One savings circle user, Argelia Diaz, says she uses the structure in addition to her bank accounts. Diaz lives and works near Bakersfield, California, and has participated in circles with her family members for five or six years, she says. Circles are a tradition in her Mexican-American family, and she talks about it using language that evokes both loans and savings accounts.</p> \n<p>""It's just an easier and quicker way to save up money on the side without having to accumulate interest at the end or paying it off,"" she says. ""It's a quicker way to establish money on the side — something you need within weeks or so. For me it's short-term.""</p> \n<p><span>Diaz uses circles for short-term saving, but many of her family members have other reasons, she says. Many aren't well educated on how to use banking services she says, and some people she knows are undocumented and don't have the paperwork necessary to establish a bank account.</span></p> \n<p>But she adds that it also comes easily in a tight-knit family where she, her mother, and her siblings see each other every week or even every day.</p> \n<p><q class=""right"" aria-hidden=""true"">because savings circles are informal structures built on trust and often used in non-white cultures, it can be easy to diminish them as ""quaint""</q></p> \n<h3>What are the drawbacks?</h3> \n<p>People who regularly ""borrow"" money in these structures miss out on big benefits of formal finance — particularly, credit score benefits. But there is a push to change that. The San Francisco-based Mission Asset Fund has been working to make circles more of a formally recognized structure by reporting to credit agencies.</p> \n<p>Step one has been stopping calling them ""savings circles,"" he says. The concept of circles isn't new, says John Quinonez, CEO at MAF. It has been around for centuries, and in many cultures — <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-01-17/in-pakistan-savings-circles-beat-banks"">Businessweek</a> earlier this year wrote about Pakistanis using the circles.</p> \n<p>But for the purposes of emphasizing the credit-building and money-lending aspect of them, he has been applying other labels to the practice.</p> \n<p>""Every time we talk about our work, about lending circles, that is just our way of articulating or sort of translating that activity that is invisible to the financial mainstream in a way that it can be understood here,"" he says. ""If we formalize it and define everything as a social loan … then we can report [payments on that loan] to a credit bureau.""</p> \n<p>But he also adds that he wants to change cultural perceptions. The fact that savings circles are informal structures built upon family trust and often used by people from non-white-American cultures, says Quinonez, means anthropologists and other writers often talk about them in a quaint light, making them sound ""cute."" The point, he says, is to both legitimize the practice but also link it to the formal financial system.</p> \n<p>""What was critical for us was to see beyond the nomenclature of savings circles and see the activity in the circles in a different light,"" he says. ""We went beyond celebrating the fact that people save informally together to formalize that activity in a way that they could build their credit history.""</p>",Business & Finance
"Homeland is still pretty good â€” itâ€™s just no longer brilliant, and that stings",http://www.vox.com/2014/10/3/6891977/homeland-season-4-review-preview,Carrie Mathison used to be one of TV's best characters. What went wrong?,"<p>What's fascinating about <i>Homeland</i>, which is returning this Sunday on Showtime, is the way that its main character's journey so closely parallels the show's. Carrie Mathison (Claire Danes) is brilliant, intuitive, and deeply passionate about her work. She's also prone to horribly bad decisions that back her into corners she can't find her way out of. It's a common idea that TV shows take on the personae of their main characters, but, c'mon, <i>Homeland</i>, this is a little on the nose.</p> \n<p>This has never been clearer than it is at the start of the show's fourth season. Much of what has always been good about the show is still good — perhaps even better. But the bad decisions that began to weigh it down in its second year and took their toll in season three cling to it like moss. <i>Homeland</i> keeps trying to rise above itself, and there are thrilling moments in all three episodes sent to critics when it does.</p> \n<p>But then Carrie Mathison takes center-stage again and you're reminded all over again of just why this show got into so much trouble that it had to completely reboot its premise just to save itself.</p> \n<p><chorus-asset class=""chorus-snippet browser_wide_media"" data-id=""2317136""> <img alt=""Homeland"" class=""small"" src=""http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2317136/homeland_DB_402_0968.R.0.jpg""> </chorus-asset></p> \n<p class=""caption"">With Brody gone, Peter Quinn (Rupert Friend) slips neatly into the male lead void. (Showtime)</p> \n<h3>A complete reboot</h3> \n<p>The most important thing you need to know starting out season four of <i>Homeland</i> is that Nicholas Brody is completely and truly dead. The show doesn't <i>quite</i> haul out the Munchkin coroner to sing a little song about it, but it might as well. Carrie even gets a little monologue in the second episode about how much she misses him, and as far as balancing grieving a hugely important character with moving on to other things goes, the show does a solid job.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""left"">The most important thing you need to know is that Nicholas Brody is completely and truly dead</q></p> \n<p>But considering how much of the show's premise was wrapped up in the endlessly vacillating Brody, it necessarily has to do something completely different with the season. That necessitates sending Carrie and the other characters to the Middle East (though they're scattered across several locations as the season begins) and it means digging into a brand new spy story where nothing is as it seems.</p> \n<p>A bombing run (signed off on by Carrie) early in the season premiere, meant to take out a terrorist, succeeds in hitting its target — but it also kills almost everyone else at the wedding he's attending. And the more that the characters dig into the circumstances surrounding the strike, the more it starts to look like one piece of a much, much larger whole.</p> \n<p>As these things go, the main story is solid stuff. Corey Stoll makes a good addition to the cast as a Pakistan CIA station chief who's at the center of some intriguing mysteries, and Rupert Friend's Peter Quinn ably steps into the role of male lead with Brody dead and gone. By the end of episode three, the central spy storyline is spreading its tendrils everywhere, and it's hard not to wonder what's coming next.</p> \n<p>But the problem is that most spy storylines are growers. They creep up on you, slowly enmeshing you in a world of intrigue. And that necessarily requires characters you're immediately invested and interested in. The first season of <i>Homeland</i> had that by the gallon, thanks to the riveting work of Damian Lewis as Brody and Danes's completely uncompromising performance as Carrie. But <i>in</i> that uncompromising performance were sown the seeds of the show's destruction as well. And that's why so much of the time spent with Carrie in the first three episodes of season four feels like such a chore.</p> \n<p><chorus-asset class=""chorus-snippet browser_wide_media"" data-id=""2317138""> <img alt=""Homeland"" class=""small"" src=""http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2317138/homeland_DB_402_1099.R.0.jpg""> </chorus-asset></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Carrie (Claire Danes) and Lockhart (Tracy Letts) spar. (Showtime)</p> \n<h3>The trouble with Carrie</h3> \n<p>The notion of the brilliant woman who suffers from a debilitating mental illness has become such a cliché in TV circles (mostly on shows that were quickly canceled) that it's easy to forget just how bracing this character was when she first appeared. In Danes's hands, she became a living embodiment of the raw nerve that is the war on terror. She was a constant reminder of everything the US had turned itself into to hunt out terrorists, and then people who were just sort of adjacent to terrorists, and then ... well, <i>what</i> then? She was self-destructive but fascinating; looking away was impossible.</p> \n<p>But once Carrie's character became almost entirely subsumed by her relationship with Brody, the show began its spiral. The second season has become so defined by its problematic ending that it's easy to forget, but the first two-thirds of that season are filled with brilliant moments and episodes where the Carrie/Brody relationship is color that fills in their currently distrustful partnership, rather than the show's guiding force. The show might have been at its best at this point, before it bought wholly into romance and spiraled into the sun.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""center"">She was self-destructive but fascinating; looking away was impossible</q></p> \n<p>And now it's just Carrie, and she's still troubled, and still bracing, and still brilliant, but it's also sort of exhausting just spending time with her. The show's treatment of her bipolar disorder has always been one of its stronger elements, but it's also something that the show can't leave behind.</p> \n<p>Walter White could have chosen to stop cooking meth and Don Draper could choose to stop sleeping with women other than his wife. That neither does this drives much of the tension of their respective shows, reflecting the way that all of us sometimes choose the worst possible thing at the worst possible moment. But Carrie can't <i>choose</i> to stop being bipolar and the show, in its commitment to honor that and tell the truth of that story, has pushed her to some dark, horrible places. In particular, there's a moment in the second episode of this new season that could be a dealbreaker for many of the show's fans.</p> \n<p>In its own way, I found that moment sort of brave and adventurous and bold for the show. It's gutsy and uncompromising, and it reminds you of just how damaged this woman is, both because of her bipolar disorder and because the government keeps using her up and wringing her out. It's like a signpost for fans of the show who might have forgotten just how horrible Carrie can be: get out before you get sucked back in.</p> \n<p>But the show seems to have forgotten what the flipside of the character was, the brilliance of Carrie, the way that she threw herself into the worst possible choices because she needed to blow up her life to save the world. Now, instead, the show gives us reflections from other people, who tell us how she's brilliant, or tell us how she's great, or maybe even feel deeply for her in ways that are slightly unbelievable. And in those moments, it feels not just like the series has lost track of its main character but also like it's terrified that in the wake of losing Brody (and his family, it should be noted), it will have to lose a whole bunch of other things as well, so it might as well shuffle them back into the deck, even if there's no good reason to.</p> \n<p><chorus-asset class=""chorus-snippet browser_wide_media"" data-id=""2317146""> <img alt=""Homeland"" class=""small"" src=""http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2317146/homeland_DB_402_0547.R.0.jpg""> </chorus-asset></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Suraj Sharma plays a Pakistani med student drawn into political webs he wants no part of. (Showtime)</p> \n<h3>An otherwise solid season</h3> \n<p>This is too bad, because the rest of season four is solid television. In particular, the storyline in Pakistan — where a survivor of the wedding strike finds himself drawn steadily into political spheres he doesn't want any part of — is meaty, messy stuff, willing to engage with the inhuman horrors of modern warfare on a deep level.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""right"">Try though it might, Homeland can never quite escape its past bad decisions </q></p> \n<p>In particular, the way that the show keeps throwing images of him (from directors Lesli Linka Glatter and Keith Gordon) up on screens that Carrie watches dispassionately in CIA bunkers juxtaposes the clinical nature of death raining down from the air with the actual human costs of that war. The show has always been interested in drones — both as a hot-button issue and as a metaphor for the way its characters seem unable to break free of their own programming — but season four pushes that to new places.</p> \n<p>And showrunner Alex Gansa and his tremendous team of writers continue to have a way with a witty turn of phrase, or with complications for the non-Carrie characters. It's great to see Saul (Mandy Patinkin) and Fara (Nazanin Boniadi) again, and the show's roster of recurring characters is surprisingly deep by now. (In particular, Tracy Letts's CIA Director Lockhart increasingly feels like the only person on the show with any sense at all, which is probably a perilous position for an antagonist to be in.) The show films on location in South Africa now, making for some great visuals. And <i>Homeland </i>even finds a way to vaguely justify last season's stupidest decision — making Carrie pregnant with Brody's child — by leaning in to just how bad of an idea it was.</p> \n<p>But try though it might, <i>Homeland</i> can never quite escape its past bad decisions, which leads it to keep making new ones. And that all comes back to the woman at the show's center. You mostly hang out with Carrie now, because you remember when she was one of TV's most exciting, interesting characters. Hell, the CIA seemingly keeps employing her because it wants her to turn the corner and become one of the best spies ever again. But the more time you spend with her, the more you realize that everything about her is right there on the surface, try though she might to break past that to her previously hidden depths.</p> \n<p>And if you replaced ""Carrie"" with ""<i>Homeland</i>"" and ""the CIA"" with ""Showtime"" in the above paragraph, you'd have a pretty great summation of the series' problems at this point in time. It's still good. It's still interesting. It's still, intermittently, vital. But it's no longer brilliant, and the gap between that and what it is now is even more frustrating than if it had just become utterly terrible.</p> \n<p><!--[if gte mso 9]><xml> 0   0   1   1323   7546   Vox Media   62   17   8852   14.0 </xml><![endif]--> <!--[if gte mso 9]><xml> Normal   0               false   false   false      EN-US   JA   X-NONE </xml><![endif]--><!--[if gte mso 9]><xml> </xml><![endif]--> <!--[if gte mso 10]> \n<style> \n /* Style Definitions */ \ntable.MsoNormalTable \n\t{mso-style-name:""Table Normal""; \n\tmso-tstyle-rowband-size:0; \n\tmso-tstyle-colband-size:0; \n\tmso-style-noshow:yes; \n\tmso-style-priority:99; \n\tmso-style-parent:""""; \n\tmso-padding-alt:0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt; \n\tmso-para-margin:0in; \n\tmso-para-margin-bottom:.0001pt; \n\tmso-pagination:widow-orphan; \n\tfont-size:12.0pt; \n\tfont-family:Cambria; \n\tmso-ascii-font-family:Cambria; \n\tmso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin; \n\tmso-hansi-font-family:Cambria; \n\tmso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin;} \n</style> \n<![endif]--></p> \n<p><i>The fourth season of Homeland debuts with a two-hour premiere Sunday at 9 p.m. Eastern on Showtime.</i></p>",Business & Finance
6 impossible tightropes we ask working women to walk,http://www.vox.com/2014/10/15/6974677/for-every-study-telling-women-how-to-get-ahead-theres-another-study,"Women should negotiate, but maybe they shouldn't. And also they should advocate for each other. But actually, maybe that's a bad thing.","<p><span>On its surface, career advancement seems gloriously uncomplicated. After all, there are a few simple truths that make rising up the ranks sound straightforward: You don't get a raise unless you ask. Having friends in high places is a tremendous help. And simply being better — smarter, more qualified, more whatever — gets you ahead.</span></p> \n<p>Except that's not exactly true — particularly for women.</p> \n<p><span>Norms, stereotypes, and the simple biology of who can bear children have all combined to make the workplace a phenomenally complicated place for a woman. Which is why, when Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella earlier this year suggested women who don't ask for raises can just get them via ""karma,"" many people responded with outrage.</span></p> \n<p><q class=""center"" aria-hidden=""true"">what nadella seemed to say was what many people know isn't true: that the workplace is a meritocracy</q></p> \n<p>What he seemed to be saying was what many women, and workers in general, know isn't true: that the workplace is a meritocracy, where whatever brownie points women have (silently) amassed can eventually be redeemed for rewards — like pay and respect commensurate with what your otherwise-equal male peers receive.</p> \n<p>Rather, the Nadella incident highlighted a contradiction that women often face at work, as the New York Times' Claire Cain Miller <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/11/upshot/why-microsofts-nadella-is-wrong-about-women-and-raises.html"">wrote</a> — that negotiation can help, or it can backfire.</p> \n<p>Scholarly research and common-sense advice in fact point to all sorts of contradictions that women can face at work.</p> \n<h3>Should you negotiate?</h3> \n<p><b>Point: </b>Carnegie Mellon University's Linda Babcock <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://pup.princeton.edu/chapters/i7575.html"">found</a> in a 2003 book that when graduate students negotiated for their first jobs out of school, they received much higher salaries — on average, $4,000 higher — regardless of gender. However, the men were far more likely to negotiate than the women.</p> \n<p><b>Counterpoint: </b>Babcock and co-authors also <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/cfawis/bowles.pdf"">found</a> in a 2005 study that negotiating can in fact hurt women. Subjects were asked to evaluate job candidates of both sexes who either negotiated or didn't negotiate for more pay. Subjects both deemed women who negotiated less hirable than the men who did so and also were less likely to say they'd want to work with those women. The authors write ""perceptions of niceness and demandingness"" were a key reason for this.</p> \n<h3>Should you have a sponsor?</h3> \n<p><b>Point:</b> Women and minorities can get boosts in areas like career advice and promotions by getting sponsors — people to advocate for them at the office — according to a 2010 <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://twitter.com/ivantohelpyou/status/522046469306478592"">study</a> published in the Harvard Business Review.</p> \n<p><b>Counterpoint: </b>A recent <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://blogs.wsj.com/atwork/2014/07/21/women-penalized-for-promoting-women-study-finds/"">study</a> from the University of Colorado, focusing on executives, found that women and minorities who advocate for fellow women and minorities were penalized for perceived ""selfishness.""</p> \n<hr> \n<p>There are also cases where women need to find the safe middle ground between two extremes.</p> \n<h3>To be tough or kind?</h3> \n<p>Plenty of women already knew this, but a <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.catalyst.org/knowledge/double-bind-dilemma-women-leadership-damned-if-you-do-doomed-if-you-dont-0"">2007 study</a> from women's advocacy organization Catalyst found that survey respondents often perceived women leaders as either too soft or too tough. In addition, survey respondents tended to see women as competent or likable — but rarely both at the same time.</p> \n<h3>How should you look at work?</h3> \n<p>Wearing makeup to work can make a woman seem more competent, likable, and trustworthy than if she's bare-faced, <a href=""http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0025656"" target=""_blank"">according</a> to a 2011 <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/13/fashion/makeup-makes-women-appear-more-competent-study.html"" target=""_blank"">study</a>. But the research — sponsored by Proctor &amp; Gamble (manufacturer of Cover Girl cosmetics) but designed and executed by academics — also found that those positive effects decline as women wear heavier makeup.</p> \n<hr> \n<p>And then there is the research that flies in the face of logic.</p> \n<h3>Should you be well-qualified?</h3> \n<p><b>Common sense: </b>Yes, of course you should.</p> \n<p><b>But wait:</b> An experiment from the London Business School <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.npr.org/2014/09/09/347017590/in-some-jobs-past-achievements-may-be-held-against-female-workers"">found</a> that volunteers who had traditional ideas about gender roles evaluated women applicants with better credentials more harshly than less qualified men. That's a very specific scenario, but it does suggest that perhaps in some male-dominated or old-fashioned industries, women will have a tougher time of it.</p> \n<h3>Should a workplace just try to get rid of all bias?</h3> \n<p><b>Common sense: </b>Again, this one seems obvious.</p> \n<p><b>But wait:</b> Trying to create an office that's a meritocracy can in fact make for more bias, MIT researchers <a target=""_blank"" href=""file:///Users/daniellekurtzleben/Downloads/65884.pdf"">found</a> in a 2010 study. The researchers had business school students make compensation decisions for a fictional company, given the company's core values.

In the Gallup data, people who work for women bosses tend to prefer working for a woman boss, while the opposite is true for people who work for men. It's true that people may be self-select into these groups, but it's easy to see why people might change their minds after having a female boss. Indeed, <span>the Gallup data also clearly shows that perceptions of women bosses are improving, meaning maybe one day we'll all be more likely to rely more upon our accomplishments and a little less on ""karma.""</span></p>",Business & Finance
Car dealers are awful. It's time to kill the dumb laws that keep them in business.,http://www.vox.com/2014/10/26/6977315/buy-car-hassle-free,It's not just the hassle. Terrible protectionist rules and bad dealership practices cost billions a year.,"<p>About a year ago this month, I bought a new car for the first time in my life, and it was an entirely crazy-making process.</p> \n<p><span>Shopping for furniture or appliances or other consumer durables is pretty straightforward. You look up what items are for sale and what they cost, you decide what you're interested in, and then you can pay. Sometimes the item you're looking for isn't in stock locally (this happened to me with a couch recently), so you're told you'll have to wait a few weeks for delivery.</span></p> \n<p>With cars, though, everything is nuts. You need to go from dealer to dealer, each of whom has his own inventory. One guy only has blue paint. The other guy doesn't have the blue paint, and also only has dark gray seats. And each has his own fake sticker prices and complicated cash-back offers. It's no wonder 83 percent consumers say they would <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.autoblog.com/2014/06/03/americans-hate-car-shopping-so-rather-give-up-sex-do-taxes/"">rather </a>skip the haggling, and a third of people say doing taxes is less annoying than working with a car dealer.</p> \n<p>But it's not just the hassle. State bans on direct sales turn out to cost consumers an enormous amount of cash. It's an enormous problem, and it warrants a federal solution.</p> \n<h3>Auto distribution is expensive</h3> \n<p><img src=""http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2388196/shutterstock_202075426.0.jpg"" alt=""shutterstock_202075426.0.jpg"" data-chorus-asset-id=""2388196""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Stacks and stacks of expensive inventory. (Shutterstock)</p> \n<p><span>Cars are the most expensive consumer product that the typical consumer buys. And while it may seem obvious that cars are expensive due to the material and labor required to build them, the logistics of <i>distributing</i> cars is actually a very expensive part of the process. Research by Eric Marti, Garth Saloner, and Michael Spence has concluded that as much as 30 percent of the </span><a href=""http://www.gsb.stanford.edu/faculty-research/case-studies/disintermediation-us-auto-industry"">cost of a car is the cost of distribution</a><span>.</span></p> \n<p><span>Along most aspects of the automobile value chain, manufacturers work hard to find less costly ways of producing automobiles. Initially these savings accrue to manufacturers in the form of higher profits. But as competition leads to the dissemination of new techniques, consumers win by getting cheaper or more advanced cars. </span></p> \n<p><span>And yet there is little innovation in the distribution process, largely because distribution needs to be run through a dispersed network of dealerships. What's visible about this to consumers is the limited choice and anachronistic haggling involved in the dealership model. The more economically savvy will note that for the dealerships to be profitable, consumers must be paying an extra, unnecessary markup.</span></p> \n<p><span>But as Gerald Bodish </span><a href=""http://www.justice.gov/atr/public/eag/246374.htm#N_14_"">wrote in a 2009 analysis</a><span> from the US Department of Justice, the most expensive part of the whole process is hiding in plain sight — it's the stockpiles of unsold vehicles sitting around on dealers' lots. He observes that in late 2008, there was a staggering $100 billion worth of unsold dealer inventory, with an annual carrying cost of $890 million.</span></p> \n<p>In other words, it's a huge pile of waste. At any given time there is a vast quantity of newly built cars sitting around unsold, and the price of the cars that are sold needs to be high enough to cover the costs of building and storing the unsold ones. Bodish cites a Goldman Sachs analysis indicating that replacing the current inventory-heavy method with a more efficient build-to-order method could reduce costs by 8.6 percent. Real-world experience from Brazil, where Chevrolet sells <a href=""http://www.chevrolet.com.br/carros/celta-5-portas.html"">Celtas</a> direct to consumers, shows a somewhat more modest savings of 6 percent relative to what's paid at traditional dealerships. Either way, for a product that costs tens of thousands of dollars it's a meaningful saving — over and above the large increase in convenience.</p> \n<h3>It's not just Tesla</h3> \n<p><img src=""http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2388212/Screen_Shot_2014-10-24_at_10.29.36_AM.0.png"" alt=""Screen_Shot_2014-10-24_at_10.29.36_AM.0.png"" data-chorus-asset-id=""2388212""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Cool car, but a little pricey. (Tesla)</p> \n<p>The issue of direct auto sales is frequently in the public eye these days because of Tesla. Tesla does not work with car dealerships. Instead, the company owns its own showrooms and sells cars directly to consumers. Every once in a while a state acts to ban these direct sales (it was <a href=""http://www.vox.com/xpress/2014/10/22/7033071/Tesla-michigan-direct-sales-ban"" target=""_blank"">Michigan most recently</a>), and stories get written about it. But the real story here is much more general than Tesla. As Federal Trade Commission economists have written, <a href=""http://www.ftc.gov/news-events/blogs/competition-matters/2014/04/who-decides-how-consumers-should-shop"" target=""_blank"">protectionist laws</a> that defend the interests of car dealerships over the broader public exist all across America.</p> \n<p>The only reason Tesla is able to sell directly at all is these laws are frequently written so as to protect <i>existing</i> dealership networks. Since Tesla is brand new, it has no existing dealer networks to circumvent, and it is able to operate legally in many states until <i>new</i> laws are passed to block it.</p> \n<p>These fights that are playing out sporadically around the country are important. Most people aren't in the market for an $85,000 electric luxury car and won't be for the foreseeable future. But buyers of F-150s and Accords and Camrys and Fusions deserve the benefits of direct sales as well. That means not just fighting back against efforts to add new anti-Tesla provisions to existing state laws, but actually rolling back the tangled web of anti-competitive rules currently in place.</p> \n<h3>A national problem needs a federal solution</h3> \n<p>Legal restrictions on direct car sales are typically a matter for state law. But the problem of excessively expensive, time-consuming, and choice-restricting auto purchases is a national one. It deserves a federal solution. What's more, it likely <i>needs</i> a federal solution.</p> \n<p>One reason dealers are so effective in lobbying state legislatures is that typically a car dealership company is local, while the manufacturer is out of state. What's more, citizens simply don't pay much attention to state politics, making it even more of a plaything for special interest lobbies. It's striking that dealer-coddling protectionist measures are just as likely to be supported by theoretically market-loving Republicans like Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder as anyone else.</p> \n<p>At the national level, a coalition for reform could be built on legislators from car-manufacturing regions, principled free marketeers, and reform-oriented liberals. The fact that the Obama administration's economic team has already <a href=""http://www.ftc.gov/news-events/blogs/competition-matters/2014/04/who-decides-how-consumers-should-shop"" target=""_blank"">weighed in against direct sale bans</a> gestures toward the possibility of bipartisan cooperation.</p> \n<p>What the FTC doesn't have is an actual proposal. But while the federal government can't directly step in and repeal state-level bans on direct auto sales, it can take advantage of the large federal role in transportation finance. A <a href=""http://www.pewtrusts.org/~/media/Assets/2014/09/SurfaceTransportationIntergovernmentalChallengesFunding.pdf?la=en"" target=""_blank"">quarter</a> of all transportation funding flows from Washington through various grant programs. Some of that money should be set aside in a ""best practices"" pool and made available to states that allow for open entry into the car-selling market, while states that refuse to reform will lose out.</p> \n<p>American consumers spend more than $60 billion at new car dealerships each month. A change in legal regime that might reduce prices by 6 to 8 percent of that total while also reducing hassles would be a huge win. And while like any useful reform it would face special interest opposition, car dealership reform doesn't force anyone to cross any ideological red lines in gridlocked Washington.</p> \n<hr> \n<h3>VIDEO: More tips for your daily life</h3> \n<!--  ########  BEGIN VOLUME VIDEO  ########  --> \n<div class=""volume-video"" id=""volume-placement-3441"" data-volume-placement=""article"" data-analytics-placement=""article:middle"" data-volume-id=""3983"" data-volume-uuid=""179317caa"" data-analytics-label=""6 signs your dentist might be ripping you off | 3983"" data-analytics-action=""volume:view:article:middle"" data-analytics-viewport=""video""></div> \n<!--  ########  END VOLUME VIDEO  ########  -->",Business & Finance

Indeed, a look at the Tax Foundation's <a href=""http://taxfoundation.org/blog/real-value-100-metropolitan-areas"">map of metro areas by cost of living</a> looks very similar to the above map, suggesting that areas with high median incomes also face disproportionately high costs of living:</p> \n<center> \n<p><img src=""http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2379886/Metro_20Price_20Parity_0.0.png"" alt=""cost living metro tax foundation"" data-chorus-asset-id=""2379886""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">(<a href=""http://taxfoundation.org/blog/real-value-100-metropolitan-areas"">Alan Cole, Lyman Stone, Tom VanAntwerp, Richard Borean / Tax Foundation</a>)</p> \n</center> \n<p>To figure out what parts of the country are best off even after you adjust for differentials in prices, I cross-referenced Census Bureau data on median household income with the Bureau of Economic Analysis's <a href=""https://www.bea.gov/newsreleases/regional/rpp/rpp_newsrelease.htm"">regional price parities data</a>, and then ranked metro areas by their price-adjusted median household incomes (<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1T8c-_pMRJrdilhECyxEEqXlzcEVLIqWcBo1C1J-hmLo/edit?usp=sharing"">click here</a> for all the data).

Forget skipping coffee. Here's how to really save money.,http://www.vox.com/2014/10/30/7083499/you-should-be-saving-more,"You're not rich, but you should be saving more anyway.","<p class=""p1"">You’re probably not saving enough for your retirement. Check out <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/7/31/5882885/retirement-planning-saving-how-much-do-i-need"">this calculator</a> and see. If you’re young, you need to be putting away about 15 percent. If you’re older and haven’t been doing that, then you need to be saving even more to catch up. Maybe 20 percent. Maybe 25. Seriously, check out the calculator.</p> \n<p class=""p1"">When presented with these facts, many people react not with alarm but with outrage. Americans don’t save enough because by and large they seem to believe it’s not possible to save that much money. And for genuinely poor families, that may be true. But the problem of under-saving is much more widespread than that. Most of the people who have told me that it was impossible to save 15 to 25 percent of their income were relatively successful professionals who could expect to earn an above-average income over the course of their careers.</p> \n<p class=""p1"">These people — the kind of people who are most likely to be reading this website — absolutely could and should be saving more.</p> \n<h3>Americans today save a lot less than their parents and grandparents</h3> \n<p>In 2014, the average savings rate was 4.8 percent, far short of what the average American worker needs to enjoy a comfortable retirement.</p> \n<p>Americans used to save a lot more:</p> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3429522/savings_rate.0.png"" alt=""savings_rate.0.png"" data-chorus-asset-id=""3429522""></p> \n<p>A generation ago, the savings rate was between 7 and 10 percent. Two generations ago, Americans saved 10 to 13 percent of their income.</p> \n<p>And while some of this might reflect a rising cost of living, especially for education and medical care, it's also a result of increased consumption. For example, the average American today has a house that's <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://money.cnn.com/2014/06/04/real_estate/american-home-size/"">50 percent larger </a>than the average house three decades ago.</p> \n<h3>There are probably people who live on a lot less than you do</h3> \n<p><img src=""http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2405262/165237028.0.jpg"" alt=""165237028.0.jpg"" data-chorus-asset-id=""2405262""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">(David Cooper/Toronto Star)</p> \n<p>America is a rich country, but our high incomes are not evenly distributed. In 2012, the richest 20 percent of households had incomes of at least $104,097. The poorest 20 percent made less than $20,600.</p> \n<p>What this means is that unless you're at the very bottom of the economic ladder, it's easy to find examples of people living more frugally than you. A household that made 2012's median income, $51,017, could save 20 percent of their income if they lived like a family at the 40th income percentile, $39,765. Similarly, a household whose income was at the 60th percentile, $64,582 could save more than 20 percent of their income if they lived like a family making the median income.</p> \n<p>That's not to say that it's easy to cut expenses. Money makes our lives easier, which is why we like spending it. Cutting expenses is a painful process. But the fact that millions of people do it proves that it's possible. And it's important to remember that you face a tradeoff between a better quality of life now and a better quality of life later. If you don't tighten your belt now, you might be forced to tighten it more dramatically when you reach retirement age.</p> \n<h3>Saving now is easier than saving later</h3> \n<p>When it comes to saving money, young workers have several advantages over older workers. One is rising incomes. Workers' incomes tend to grow fastest early in their careers as they gain experience and seniority. Later in their career, they're more likely to stay at the same (hopefully higher) income level.</p> \n<p>This means that for many young workers, saving money may not require any actual belt-tightening. It just means not boosting their spending when they get raises. It means keeping a roommate for a few more years rather than getting your own place. It means keeping a one-bedroom apartment instead of looking for a place with two bedrooms. It means continuing to patronize cheap bars and restaurants rather than moving upscale.</p> \n<p><q class=""right"" aria-hidden=""true"">You can expect every $1 you save at age 25 to grow to between $4 and $10 by age 65</q></p> \n<p>Even better, if you develop more frugal habits today, that can reduce the amount of income — and, therefore, savings — you need when you reach your retirement age. If you never upgrade from a Honda to a BMW during your working years, then you don't have to worry about whether you'll be able to afford a BMW in your golden years. So saving aggressively early in your career has a double benefit: it increases the amount of cash you have in the bank, while simultaneously reducing the amount you'll feel like you need later.</p> \n<p>Most importantly, thanks to the power of compounding interest, dollars you save early go a lot farther. If you <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/10/23/7027925/9-questions-about-401-k-s-you-were-too-embarrassed-to-ask"">follow sound investment principles</a>, you can expect every $1 you save at age 25 to grow to between $4 and $10 (adjusted for inflation) by age 65. A dollar saved at 35 will grow three to five times by 65. So if saving an extra $1,000 this year is difficult, imagine how much worse off your 65-year-old self will be when you have to cut expenses by $5,000.</p> \n<h3>Focus on big-ticket items</h3> \n<p><img src=""http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2405226/115741166.0.jpg"" alt=""115741166.0.jpg"" data-chorus-asset-id=""2405226""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Your retired self will thank you for driving a car like this. (Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)</p> \n<p>Often, when people try to cut costs, they do it by reducing small, optional expenses — like making coffee at home instead of buying it from a coffee shop. But while trimming those kinds of expenses never hurts, it's often more important to <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/8/7/5975799/budget-household-helaine-olen-harold-pollack"">focus on expenses</a> that people think of as the essentials — especially housing costs.</p> \n<p>Obviously, everyone needs a place to live, so you're not going to be able to eliminate housing costs altogether. But there are a lot of things you can do to reduce them. You can get a smaller apartment or get a roommate. You could move farther out in the suburbs where you can get more housing for less money. And if your personal circumstances allow it, it's worth considering moving in with parents to save money.</p> \n<p>Housing costs account for such a large fraction of many people's incomes — especially in big cities — that even modest reductions can free up a lot of cash.</p> \n<p>Cars are another big-ticket item that may offer room for savings. Some people view a new, expensive car as a status symbol, but you can probably find a used car that will do the same job while saving you thousands of dollars.</p> \n<h3>Consider moving to a cheaper metropolitan area</h3> \n<p><img src=""http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2405266/107544485.0.jpg"" alt=""107544485.0.jpg"" data-chorus-asset-id=""2405266""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">If you don't mind the cold, Minneapolis is a great place to live. (Tom Dahlin/Getty Images)</p> \n<p>If you live in a big metro area like New York or San Francisco, it might be a struggle to find affordable housing even if you get a tiny apartment or move far out into the suburbs. In that case, it's worth thinking hard about whether you really need to live in an expensive metropolitan area.</p> \n<p>Housing costs are dramatically lower in other parts of the country. Philadelphia has many of the same amenities as other coastal cities but is dramatically cheaper than New York or Washington, DC. And the Midwest and the Sun Belt have cities that are cheaper still. As my colleague Matt Yglesias has <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2012/11/06/minneapolis_research_says_you_should_move_to_the_twin_cities.html"">pointed out</a>, Minneapolis offers an appealing combination of high incomes and low housing costs. And if the cold weather doesn't suit you, Southern cities like Dallas and Atlanta are equally affordable.</p> \n<p>Of course, some people have careers that require them to live in a particular, expensive city. And it might be difficult to earn a comparable salary in a lower-cost area. But many people could move to a much less expensive city without taking a big pay cut. If you're one of them, you could dramatically improve your standard of living.</p> \n<h3>It's okay to save less if you're building human capital</h3> \n<p>Most working adults should be saving 10 to 20 percent of their income each year. An important exception is young people who are accepting a dramatically lower income in the short run to prepare them for more lucrative or prestigious careers later on.</p> \n<p><q class=""right"" aria-hidden=""true"">Many people could move to a much less expensive city without taking a big pay cut</q></p> \n<p>The most obvious example is people who are still in school. If you're waiting tables to cover the costs of getting a college degree, or if you're a graduate student with a $15,000-per-year stipend, it's going to be hard to save money for retirement. In this case, it's best to think of your education as a kind of savings in its own right — you're acquiring a valuable credential that will allow you to earn, and save, a lot more money in the future.</p> \n<p>A similar point applies to people who are just starting out in a highly competitive career, like acting, writing, or fashion. Almost everyone in these industries starts out working a low-paying day job like bartending, waiting tables, or answering phones until they're able to get enough work to practice their passion full-time. Again, this is best thought of as a kind of investment: you're developing a skill that — you hope — will later allow you to earn a good living in a career you'll enjoy a lot more than bartending.</p> \n<p>But it's important to be realistic. At age 25, it might be reasonable to live paycheck to paycheck as you focus all your energy on breaking into an acting career. But if you're still doing that at age 30, you need to start planning for the possibility that you're never going to get your big break. You need to either get a more lucrative job or cut expenses enough to save 10 to 15 percent of your bartending income.</p> \n<h3>Tackle peer pressure head on</h3> \n<p>Pressure from peers can be a major force driving higher spending. If you go out to eat with a group of friends and one of them wants to order a bottle of wine, it's awkward to be the one who objects to the added expense. But Megan McArdle <a target=""new"" href=""http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2013-09-17/13-tips-for-jobless-grads-on-surviving-the-basement-years"">has some good advice</a> on dealing with this kind of situation:</p> \n<blockquote style=""margin: 0 0 0 40px; border: none; padding: 0px;""> \n<p>Go to the mirror. Take a long, loving look at yourself. And then repeat after me: ""I can’t afford it."" That is what you say to friends who suggest going out when you don’t really make enough money to even stay in. It’s what you say to yourself when you’re feeling bad and want a splurge. There is nothing shameful about making very little money, so there’s no reason you shouldn’t tell your friends that you’re on a tight budget.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>McArdle was writing about people who were having trouble finding work, but this is good advice for anyone who is trying to keep their spending down. If your friends are worth keeping, they should be more than happy to work with you to find activities that fit in your budget. More importantly, some of your friends might feel the same way, and be grateful to you for speaking up.</p>",Business & Finance

Hosting the Olympics is a terrible idea for most cities. And it's very likely a terrible idea for Washington DC.</p> \n<p><span>Just listen to the economists who study this topic: ""My basic takeaway for any city considering a bid for the Olympics is to run away like crazy,"" Victor Matheson, a professor of economics at College of the Holy Cross, told me </span><a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/08/27/economists-think-its-a-terrible-idea-for-d-c-to-host-the-2024-olympics/"" target=""_blank"">in an interview last fall</a><span>. His research </span><a href=""http://econpapers.repec.org/RAS/pma211.htm"" target=""_blank"">has found</a><span> that hosting ""mega-sports events"" like the World Cup or Olympics tends to cost an enormous amount — and brings few tangible benefits.</span></p> \n<p>Matheson's argument is a fairly nuanced one. There's nothing inherently<i> </i>bad about hosting the Olympics. In theory, Washington DC might be able to do so at a reasonable cost — and avoid the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Winter_Olympics#Budget_and_infrastructure_issues"" target=""_blank"">bloated fiasco we saw in Sochi</a> in the winter of 2014. But in practice, reasonableness rarely prevails. The International Olympic Committee hasn't historically favored cities that pledge to do things cheaply. ""The bids that make economic sense are the bids have no chance of winning,"" is how Matheson put it to me. ""And the bid that will end up winning won't make economic sense.""</p> \n<p>The evidence is compelling. Back in 2013, Matheson and Robert Baumann <a href=""http://college.holycross.edu/RePEc/hcx/Baumann-Matheson_MegaEventsDeveloping.pdf"" target=""_blank"">put out a paper</a> studying the experiences of cities that hosted ""mega-sporting events"" in the past. They found that the costs tend to skyrocket, the economic upside was negligible, and the cities that have benefited seem to be special exceptions. That said, there <i>is </i>some evidence that hosting mega-sporting events makes people a bit happier. So not all is lost.</p> \n<h3>The cost of hosting the Olympics tends to get out of control</h3> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""2404380"" alt=""508761075.0.jpg"" src=""http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2404380/508761075.0.jpg""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Bird's Nest, Beijing. Francisco Diez/Moment/Getty Images</p> \n<p>DC residents might look around and think, hey, it wouldn't be <i>that </i>hard to host the Summer Olympics on a budget. There are already plenty of hotels, good transportation networks, and sports facilities in DC and Baltimore. Why not just take advantage of those?</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""right"">'Organizing bodies have rarely selected hosts that have promised to minimize spending'</q></p> \n<p>The big problem here, Matheson and Baumann observe, is that the International Olympics Committee has rarely awarded the Olympics to cities that try to skimp on costs. The committee hasn't usually been thrilled about holding track events held in fields built two decades ago — they'd prefer a shiny new stadium. And if DC doesn't build it, a competing city probably will.</p> \n<p>""<span>Faced with bids from multiple competing cities and countries,"" the authors write, ""the organizing bodies have rarely selected hosts that have promised to minimize spending on sports infrastructure."" And costs have soared even higher since 9/11, thanks to rising security costs. (Sydney spent a few hundred million dollars on Olympic security in 2000, but Athens was spending over $1 billion by 2004.)</span></p> \n<p>Indeed, it's telling that the one city in recent times that kept costs down was Los Angeles in 1984. That's because LA was the only city seriously bidding that year (others had been scared off by Montreal's experience with the 1976 Olympics, which left the city staggering under $1.5 billion in debt). This allowed Los Angeles to dictate its terms and make heavy use of existing infrastructure like the Rose Bowl. Alas, DC likely <a style=""line-height: 1.5; background-color: #ffffff;"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Summer_Olympics"" target=""_blank"">won't be the only city</a><span> competing for the 2024 Olympics — and history suggests that it'll be much harder to hold down costs.</span></p> \n<p>Now, it's possible that the bidding process could become more reasonable in the future than it has in the past. The International Olympic Committee is now trying to revamp the process for the 2024 Olympics — <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.foxnews.com/sports/2014/10/20/after-rejections-for-2022-games-ioc-hopes-for-high-quality-field-for-2024/"">by allowing cities</a> to tailor their bids to their own needs rather than adhere to strict IOC guidelines. (These reforms came after too many cities were scared away from hosting the 2022 Winter Olympics.) These new reforms could help tamp down on the insanity, but that's not yet certain. It might be prudent for cities like DC to wait and see whether the committee really has changed things up.</p> \n<p>By the way, there are plenty of ideas for reforming this selection process even more drastically. Some onlookers <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/prishe/2014/10/04/ioc-must-change-selection-criteria-when-choosing-olympic-host-cities/"" target=""_blank"">have argued</a> that the International Olympic Committee should simply pick 4 or 5 cities to host the Olympics in perpetuity, on a rotating basis. That could help keep costs down, as these cities could reuse their fields and stadiums and other infrastructure. But that's not on the table right now.</p> \n<h3><span>Hosting the Olympics doesn't seem to boost a city's economy</span></h3> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""2404384"" alt=""501593469.0.jpg"" src=""http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2404384/501593469.0.jpg""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Viewed from a tourist boat on the Thames, we see Tower Bridge decorated with the Olympic Rings in 2012, just before the London Games began. (Apexphotos/Moment/Getty Images)</p> \n<p>Of course, some extra spending on the Olympics might be worthwhile if these big sporting events gave a jolt to the economy. But there's little evidence for this. <span>""Unfortunately,"" Matheson and Baumann conclude, ""the academic literature has not been able to link hosting an Olympics or World Cup with economic growth.""</span></p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""right"">London actually saw a decline in international visitors during the 2012 Olympics</q></p> \n<p><span></span><span>Why might that be? The simplest explanation might be that large sporting events are too small to move the needle on a massive metropolitan economy like London's or Atlanta's. Alternatively, much of the ""extra"" economic activity during the Olympics may just come from locals who would have spent their money regardless.</span></p> \n<p>But there's another more worrisome possibility: Perhaps all those eager sports fans crowd out other businesses. The two economists note that London actually saw an overall drop in international visitors when it hosted the 2012 Summer Olympics, possibly because other tourists stayed away. That's a cautionary tale for DC, which has a vibrant tourism economy.</p> \n<p><span>But what about infrastructure benefits? Olympic boosters often note that a big event like this can give a city an excuse to upgrade its airports, roads, subways, hotels — key improvements that might not otherwise happen. Yet </span><span>Matheson and Baumann find this rarely goes as planned. The tight deadlines for events like the Olympics ""can serve to raise costs due to rushed schedules, relaxed bidding rules, and potential corruption.""</span></p> \n<p>Worse still, many cities end up building out redundant infrastructure. ""An airport, transportation network, or number of hotel rooms that is the right size for three weeks of tourist insanity may be extensively overbuilt for the post-event period,"" they write. ""For example, two major luxury hotels built for the 1994 Winter Olympics in Lillehammer, Norway, filed for bankruptcy shortly after the close of the Games.""</p> \n<h3>Only a few cities have benefited from hosting the Olympics</h3> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""2404390"" alt=""51431998.0.jpg"" src=""http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2404390/51431998.0.jpg""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">The Olympic rings are set on the pitch during the opening ceremony of the XXVth Summer Olympics 25 July 1992 at Montjuic Stadium. (Michael Gangne/AFP/Getty Images)</p> \n<p>Now, to be fair, there are a few cities that have benefited from hosting the Olympics. But those are exceptions. Los Angeles in 1984 got a good deal — but, again, it was the sole serious bidder that year, something that hasn't really happened since. (Though, who knows, if enough cities <a href=""http://time.com/3462070/olympics-winter-2022/"" target=""_blank"">get scared off from future bids</a>, it could happen again.)</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""right"">Barcelona is one of the rare exceptions </q></p> \n<p>Another beneficiary was Barcelona, which hosted the Summer Olympics in 1992. Yes, its Olympic Park sits lonely and largely unused these days. But the city seemed to get a boost in reputation. ""Before 1992, Barcelona had been overshadowed by Madrid, Rome, Paris, etc. They could essentially use Olympics as advertising, to put the city on the map,"" Matheson said. But don't expect Washington DC to get a similar boost: ""<span>For that to work you need to be a hidden gem, a great tourist destination that no one knows about.</span><span> </span><span>"" </span></p> \n<p>There's one last twist here. Baumann and Matheson do<i> </i>note that it's probably better if a rich country hosts the Olympics than a poorer nation — given all the negative impacts. H<span>ere's how Matheson put it to me: ""If you're going to waste $10 billion, would you rather waste Northern Virginia/DC's money or waste Cape Town's money?"" Which is fairer, economically speaking? So DC could always host the Olympics as an inefficient form of foreign assistance, saving a poorer country from madness. As foreign aid goes, though, this probably ranks below malaria nets and deworming pills in effectiveness.</span></p> \n<h3>That said, hosting the Olympics might make people happier</h3> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""2404392"" alt=""451274724.0.jpg"" src=""http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2404392/451274724.0.jpg""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Just think, this could be us. (John Lamparski/WireImage/Getty Images)</p> \n<p>Mind you, there's more to life than dollars and cents. <span>Even if hosting the Olympics is an economic fiasco, it might make locals happier. ""There's very little evidence that these sports events contribute to long-run economic growth,"" Matheson told me last fall. ""But there is fairly robust evidence that they make people happier. After Germany hosted the World Cup in 2006, there was a big marked increase in reported happiness.""</span></p> \n<p>So there's that. Residents of Washington DC might derive some pride and joy from hosting the Olympics. That's no small thing. Just don't expect too many other positives to come of it.</p> \n<p><i>Note: </i>This post draws on interviews/research I did <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/08/27/economists-think-its-a-terrible-idea-for-d-c-to-host-the-2024-olympics/"" target=""_blank"">for a previous piece</a> on this topic, though it's been updated to reflect a few current events (like the news that the IOC wants to change the selection process).</p>",Business & Finance
This is what it feels like to be unemployed for years,http://www.vox.com/2014/12/10/7329541/skill-erosion-long-term-unemployed,"The term among economists for losing your job market value when you're unemployed is ""skill erosion."" Here's what that feels like.","<p>""It wasn't that the skills were going; it's that my memory wasn't as good,"" says Brian Hatfield, a 33-year-old from Escondido, California. After a recent, one-year bout of unemployment, he says he had forgotten a few minor, basic skills from his former administrative and retail jobs. But it wasn't those that troubled him — he found himself getting duller and slower in day-to-day conversations.</p> \n<p>He might not use the term, but Hatfield is describing a phenomenon economists call <a href=""http://sam2012.ucy.ac.cy/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/lien_laureys_March_15_2012.pdf"" target=""_blank"">skill erosion</a>, the tendency of the long-term unemployed to lose their skills (and therefore their value) in the labor market. Even while the headline unemployment rate falls, those who have been out of work for a long time, sometimes years, are feeling the lingering damage of the recession on a personal level. And even while the number of unemployed falls, the share who are out of work six months or more remains <a href=""http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/LNS13025703"" target=""_blank"">abnormally high</a>.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""center"">""you can only get up in the morning and check the job sites so many times""</q></p> \n<p>The exact nature of this erosion is something economists' datasets don't really explore. So I spoke to several long-term unemployed people and listened to their stories. These are four accounts that illustrate skill erosion, from the point of view of the people actually losing the skills. It's much more subtle than forgetting your old job skills — and even when those skills do go, they often can easily come back with new work — rather, it can be a slow creep of falling out of step with new technology, <span>falling out of touch with people in your industry,</span><span> </span><span>and falling out of practice of working with others. Here's a necessarily anecdotal, but broad-based, look at the human element behind the next great economic challenge.</span></p> \n<h3>The skill loss can be subtle</h3> \n<p>Lon Feil says he has been out of graphic design work for a year and a half now. The 48-year-old from Lisbon, Iowa, last worked in that field designing standardized tests for Pearson, where he spent nine years. He says he eventually decided the job was a bad fit for him — he wanted to do more creative work — and because he didn't like it, his performance suffered, and he was terminated. He's looking for a new graphic design job now, but having been away from it for so long, he can feel himself losing the ability to use the basic tools of his former job.</p> \n<p>""It's been a couple of years, and I used to use this software on a daily basis,"" he says, referring to Adobe programs like InDesign and Photoshop. <span>""You forget things. There's all the hotkey shortcuts and just how the software works. And yeah, I definitely feel like i'm losing some of that,"" he says. He knows if he's given a chance, he can relatively quickly relearn some shortcuts and pick up a program again. But the longer he's out of work, the more he could forget, and the more new software versions might come out that will make it just a step or two harder for him to learn.</span></p> \n<p><span>Today, Feil is what economists would call underemployed — he has started working part-time at Home Depot, work that neither gives him enough hours nor uses his full skill set.</span></p> \n<p>That keeps him busy and makes ends meet, but it doesn't allow him to keep up the skills that would allow him to become fully employed. Now that he's out of the graphic design field and only working part-time, he says he's hesitant to spend on the programs he once used every day.</p> \n<p>""They're super-expensive, and I guess if I got some kind of freelance work I'd consider getting that at home,"" he says. ""But right now it's not worth it for me to get it.""</p> \n<p>Feil says he's applied to around 200 jobs at this point, but he's had no luck yet.</p> \n<p>""I have times where I get pretty down about it and listless. You can only get up in the morning <span>and check the job sites so many times,"" he says. ""I'm really anxious to get back to work; that's </span><span>for sure.""</span></p> \n<h3>It's not just about losing skills — it's about losing touch</h3> \n<p>When she was out of work for almost a year, Melinda Kozel says she felt some of her skills slip, but in different ways from Feil's.</p> \n<p>""<span>I didn't have any structure. </span><span>I felt like I had no time. ... I definitely felt less organized,"" she says. </span></p> \n<p><span>In September 2013, Kozel left her job as a program coordinator for an arts organization in northeast Nebraska. She says she left voluntarily — she had been living and working hours away from her husband, in Omaha, and they finally decided they were tired of the long-distance relationship. But after a few initial promising interviews, her search ended up taking nearly a year. Losing skills like organization and time management was bad, she says, but what may have hurt her more was that she </span><span>fell out of the loop.</span></p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""right"">""i didn't have any structure ... i definitely felt less organized""</q></p> \n<p><span></span><span>""I definitely didn't feel like I was a part of the arts circle anymore. ... </span><span>I felt like I didn't have any connection anymore.""</span></p> \n<p>She finally found a job in August, working as the manager of an arts library. Getting that job involved forcing herself to start networking all over again, something she had stopped doing. Getting herself back into the networking game, she says, was hard, but it's what eventually found her the job she has today.</p> \n<p>""I think it was a thing that took time to really kind of get my face out there,"" she says. ""I know within the last couple months before I found the job I didn't want to go out anymore.""</p> \n<h3>Being depressed about being out of work makes it worse</h3> \n<p>Hatfield is proof that getting out of long-term unemployment can be bumpy, at best. Since mid-2011, when he quit his administrative job with the city of Huntington Beach to move to San Marcos, where his girlfriend had gotten a job, he says he has had two bouts of long-term unemployment, totaling nearly two years. Mixed into that unemployment, he has had a short stint at a printing company, held a part-time job at Bed Bath &amp; Beyond, and helped a friend launch a failed iPad app. In March 2014, after a nearly one-year stretch of unemployment, he finally found the job he has today: an administrative assistant position at a company that makes air quality monitors.</p> \n<p><span>Hatfield can list a few things he forgot how to do when he was out of work — making labels, performing a mail merge, ""the lingo from Bed Bath &amp; Beyond"" — but he says many of the problems were mental.</span></p> \n<p>""When I was at work again and speaking and being in conversations, and having new information I had to remember, I was realizing I was just sharper and quicker than I was when I was just unemployed and bummed out about being unemployed,"" he says.</p> \n<p>This is why long-term unemployment can be so insidious: it's not just that you get discouraged from being out of work or that employers might be discriminating against you. Rather, you fall out of practice of talking and working with others, which doesn't exactly increase your chances of getting a job when you do find an interested employer.</p> \n<h3>It doesn't happen to everyone</h3> \n<p>It has been at least three years since Susan Cox-Smith, a 52-year-old from Greensboro, North Carolina, was last fully employed. Until 2011, she worked as an interactive producer for online course curriculums at UNC-Greensboro. Today, she says, she does some informal work, teaching six to 10 classes per week at local gyms (at around $20 per class) and supporting her husband's consulting business.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""center"">""no one i know is sitting back and waiting for their old job to come back""</q></p> \n<p><span>""</span><span>In my opinion, the 'erosion of skills' trope is a load of BS,"" she says. ""Everyone I know, especially older workers, has done everything they can to add to their toolboxes and improve their qualifications.""</span></p> \n<p>Cox-Smith has been unemployed and underemployed for more than three years, but she has been busy that whole time, taking online courses, doing the occasional contract job, volunteering, and blogging. Because of that, she says she hasn't felt her skills erode — most of the unemployed people she knows, she says, stayed sharp by simply never having stopped moving.</p> \n<p><span>""Most professions genuinely rely more on general experience and an ability to apply old knowledge to new problems, not learning completely new programs and processes and discarding old ones,"" she says. All of her activity, whether it's at the gym or in online classes, may have helped her maintain that ""general experience"" and upkeep her basic job skills. The same goes, she says, for others who have been out of work.</span></p> \n<p><span>""No one I know is sitting back and waiting for their old job to come back,"" she says. </span></p> \n<p><span>Indeed, she is ready for a change herself. Cox-Smith would like to move into a new area — working for a non-profit organization that advocates for a cause she believes in, like women's rights. But even though she doesn't feel she has lost her skills, she still has barriers to finding new work. Her resume has a long list of activities in a wide range of fields, but also an unfinished college degree and a full-time work experience that ends in 2011.</span></p> \n<p>""I believe I am essentially invisible to potential employers as my education, experience, work history and skill set are confusing to them,"" she says. ""I am too great an unknown.""</p> \n<p><span></span></p>",Business & Finance
Why Uber could be worth $70 billion,http://www.vox.com/2014/12/4/7336433/uber-worth-,People scoffing at Uber's high valuation are ignoring that Uber could get a big share of an expanded market.,"<p>In June 2014, Uber made headlines by <a href=""http://techcrunch.com/2014/06/06/uber-1-2b/"" target=""_blank"">raising an eye-popping $1.2 billion</a>, in a deal that valued the company at $17 billion. Now, a bit more than a year later, the company has had <i>seven more</i> rounds of fundraising, raising $6.7 billion in additional venture capital. And now the New York Times is <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/24/business/dealbook/uber-said-to-plan-another-1-billion-in-fund-raising.html?_r=0"">reporting</a> that the company is trying to raise yet another billion dollar round — and that the company now believes itself to be worth $60 to $70 billion.</p> \n<p>When last years's $17 billion valuation was announced, it generated howls of skepticism. Aswath Damodaran, for example, <a href=""http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/uber-isnt-worth-17-billion/"" target=""_blank"">estimated</a> that the global taxi industry is worth $100 billion and Uber might get 10 percent of it, which would value the company at around $6 billion. <a href=""http://iterativepath.wordpress.com/2014/05/22/if-you-most-aggressively-value-uber-from-its-only-known-revenue-model/"" target=""_blank"">Another estimate</a> used a much smaller figure for the global taxi industry — $22 billion — but a much higher Uber market share — 50 percent — to arrive at a valuation just under $17 billion.</p> \n<p>Now, investors seem to think the company is worth three to four times as much. Has the world gone mad? Not really. There are a couple of factors that could actually justify Uber's skyrocketing valuation.</p> \n<h3>The coming Uber monopoly</h3> \n<p>One is if this turns out to be a winner-take-all market. There are some industries — like search engines and social media — where the biggest firm winds up dwarfing all the others.</p> \n<p>The smartphone-powered taxi market has the right characteristics for this: passengers are going to prefer the network with the most drivers, because that keeps down the average wait time. Drivers will want to drive for the network with the most passengers for the same reason. This factor gives the market leader a systematic advantage that will be hard for Lyft — to say nothing of smaller rivals or not-yet-founded startups — to overcome.</p> \n<p>Chris Mims of the <i>Wall Street Journal</i> has <a href=""http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2014/06/06/commentary-ubers-18-2b-valuation-is-a-head-scratcher/"" target=""_blank"">predicted</a> that Uber's profit margins would be destroyed by competition. But if Uber emerges as the undisputed king of the ride-sharing market, that won't happen. Uber will have the lion's share of passengers, and so drivers will have little choice but to give Uber its 20 percent cut.</p> \n<p>A big question here is whether this market will have a global leader — like Facebook or Google — or whether each country will have its own dominant ride-sharing firm. Uber is facing growing competition from home-grown ride-sharing companies in China, India, and other countries. A big reason Uber is raising money so aggressively is that it hopes to expand quickly into these other countries, eventually achieving a dominant market share around the world — not just in the United States.</p> \n<h3>Uber could expand its market</h3> \n<p>The convenience of Uber — and innovations like its UberPOOL carpooling service — could dramatically expand the size of the market. A lot of people take fewer taxi rides than they'd like to because of high costs or limited availability. Uber and Lyft have already pushed down fares and expanded availability, and Uber may achieve further improvements on both fronts in the coming years. In the process, they may significantly expand the overall market.</p> \n<p>And there could be a lot of room for expansion. The current size of the US taxi market — $11 billion, according to one estimate — represents just $35 per American. That's largely because only a handful of large cities are dense enough to support a large-scale taxi market based on taxis being hailed from the street.</p> \n<p>Uber makes it possible to offer taxi services in low-density cities and even suburbs where cabs are rare today. In the traditional model, you'd call a cab company and ask them to send you a taxi. But because each company controls only a small fraction of cars in the city, they might not have anyone nearby, and you might be forced to wait a long time. Uber drastically improves the customer experience here: the company is likely to find a car that's relatively nearby, and because you can follow its progress in realtime, you know exactly how long you'll have to wait.</p> \n<p>And as Vox's Matt Yglesias has <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/6/7/5788558/why-uber-just-might-be-worth-it-at-18-billion"" target=""_blank"">noted</a>, the market could expand even further with the emergence of self-driving vehicles. If users around the world become accustomed to hailing cars using Uber, it will be easy to convince them to use Uber to hail self-driving cars once those become available. And because self-driving taxis have no driver, they could be dramatically cheaper than the traditional kind.</p> \n<p>People tend to systematically under-estimate the growth potential of the most successful technology startups because they fail to appreciate how much new technologies can change peoples behaviors. The high quality of Google's search engine made the web dramatically more useful, causing people to use Google far more than they used previous search engines.

Is last week's jobs report a sign of a real recovery?,http://www.vox.com/2014/12/5/7339547/recovery-winter,"There's lots of reasons for optimism, but also a few reasons for doubt.","<p>Friday morning, the Labor Department released a truly excellent jobs report. The headline number was great, with <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/12/5/7339051/november-unemployment-rate/in/7103058"">321,000 jobs added in November</a>. Digging deeper, the <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/12/5/7339073/jobs-report-good-news"">trends really just look even better</a>. Wages are rising. Hours worked are rising. The previous two months' numbers were revised upward as well, giving us a three-month average of 278,000 jobs.</p> \n<p>Given that the total population of working age people is growing slowly at the moment, that's excellent job growth. It's enough to make one hope that the American economy is genuinely out of the woods and 2015 will be the year that we stop thinking of ourselves as living in the shadow of the Great Recession.</p> \n<p>So is it true?</p> \n<h3>Reasons for optimism</h3> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""2522296"" alt=""Screen_Shot_2014-12-05_at_11.27.58_AM.0.png"" src=""https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2522296/Screen_Shot_2014-12-05_at_11.27.58_AM.0.png""></p> \n<p>There is real reason to be optimistic about the future of the American economy. And it's not just today's excellent jobs report or the two previous good ones. Looking at the year as a whole, we're on track to add 2.65 million jobs in 2014 which would make it the best year since the boom of 1999.</p> \n<p>What's more, 2015 looks good, too. The trend toward cheaper crude oil prices is a <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/12/3/7319787/oil-economy"">broad boost to the American economy</a>. The Obama administration's new immigration policies are a <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/11/21/7256341/immigration-economic-impact"">boost to the American economy</a>. The state and local budget cutbacks that slowed the economy in 2009-2011 are over. And there's reason to believe the government-by-crisis that dominated congressional politics in 2011-2013 is also over. Unlike in previous years, there are no big automatic spending cuts or tax hikes lurking in the federal budget to hold the economy back. We'll probably even get a moderate dose of fiscal stimulus from the federal government.</p> \n<p>Last, but by no means least, there's the question of monetary stimulus. Interest rates are zero this winter, just as they were the winter before and the winter before that (and the previous three). But the meaning of low interest rates changes as the economic fundamentals change. Back in 2009 with massive excess capacity throughout the economy, the Fed was effectively trying to drive up a steep hill. The economy of 2014 offers a much gentler slope. So similar interest rates should offer a bigger kick.</p> \n<h3>On the other hand</h3> \n<p>All the news I can see is good. But my enthusiasm is tempered by the <a href=""http://www.slate.com/articles/business/moneybox/2011/12/economic_recovery_why_good_things_are_about_to_start_happening_again_.html"">""recovery winter"" experience</a> of late 2011 and early 2012 when the economy also had a <a href=""http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2012/02/03/recovery_winter_arrives_with_huge_243_000_increase_in_payroll_employment.html"">string of good jobs numbers</a>. It turned out to be a mirage. The November 2014 jobs report is a triumph, but January 2012 was even better — 360,000 new jobs. The next month things slowed to 226,000. Then 243,000.</p> \n<p>Then instead of a new dawn of prosperity, we got a disastrous spring. 96,000 jobs in April. 110,000 in May. 88,000 in June. Things picked up after that, but not in an exuberant happy-days-are-here-again kind of way. It was just a return to the long hard slog of a recovery.</p> \n<p>What went wrong? In a word: events. Things took a turn south in Europe. The Federal Reserve lost its nerve on unconventional policy.</p> \n<p>Maybe there was some bad luck. Maybe the seasonal adjustment algorithm was a little discombobulated over the winter. Whatever the cause, it was — and is — a reminder that the economy is hard to predict, and subject to a wide variety of shocks from a range of locations.</p> \n<h3>The path forward</h3> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""2521986"" alt=""wages.0.png"" src=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2521986/wages.0.png""></p> \n<p>The recent news has been good and the outlook seems bright, if uncertain. The most important question is how policymakers respond to the good news. With luck, Congress will continue to follow the relatively responsible course of 2014 rather than the disastrous one of 2011. That means no more debt-ceiling debacles. It means congressional gridlock and stasis rather than a new government shutdown.</p> \n<p>But the key actor is the Federal Reserve. Financial markets are only very modestly up on the good news about the labor market.</p> \n<p>This is because, at the moment, it's widely anticipated that the faster the economy grows this winter, the sooner the Fed will hike interest rates come springtime. In other words, good news implies coming bad news. That's a recipe for slow growth rather than a takeoff.</p> \n<p>Of course, if for some reason inflation spikes well above the Fed's 2 percent target, then an early rate hike may be necessary. But Janet Yellen needs to disabuse the world of the notion that solid growth alone will prompt tighter money. To get a boom, the Fed needs to be willing to welcome a boom. If people can get jobs and raises without sparking a surge in consumer prices, that should be welcomed, not feared.</p>",Business & Finance
Map: Each state's most distinctive job,http://www.vox.com/2014/12/10/7351395/location-quotient-map,It's soil and plant scientists for Iowa and animal breeders for Wisconsin. What about your state?,"<p>Texas is full of oilmen, and Kentucky and West Virginia are big on mining. That's pretty obvious, but some states have disproportionate employment in less intuitive categories. New Hampshire is all about forest fire prevention, Missouri likes to split rocks, and Mississippi is for upholsterers.</p> \n<p>Here's a state-by-state look at the most disproportionately popular job in each place (scroll over to zoom or <a href=""https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2536436/locationquotient1.0.png"" target=""_blank"">click here</a> for a bigger map):</p> \n<div class=""image-zoom-tool IZT-vox""><img src=""https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2536436/locationquotient1.0.png"" class=""zoom""></div> \n<p>On a technical level, what this map looks at are <i>location quotients</i>.

The best Christmas movies aren't about Christmas,http://www.vox.com/2014/12/8/7352195/christmas-movies,Sometimes they're just Christmas-adjacent.,"<p>It's late December, which means it's time for TV networks to haul out holiday standards. But what if you're not in the mood for the kinds of holiday cheer whipped up by <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0085334/?ref_=nv_sr_1""><i>A Christmas Story</i></a> or <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0038650/?ref_=nv_sr_1""><i>It's a Wonderful Life</i></a>? What if you want to celebrate the season with something a little less filled with cheer, something set <i>during</i> the season but not really <i>of</i> the season?</p> \n<p>Well, have you considered something Christmas-adjacent? The term, which I first encountered in <a href=""http://www.avclub.com/article/die-hard-works-because-its-only-christmasadjacent-106073"">this essay on </a><a href=""http://www.avclub.com/article/die-hard-works-because-its-only-christmasadjacent-106073""><i>Die Hard</i></a><a href=""http://www.avclub.com/article/die-hard-works-because-its-only-christmasadjacent-106073""> by Zack Handlen</a>, simply means a story that is set at least in part during the holiday season, but not a story that is dominated by said holidays. It can be an action movie or a horror film. It can even be a downbeat drama. Anything but the usual blast of cheer, and it's fine.</p> \n<p>Here, then, are nine Christmas-adjacent films that might help you get in the holiday spirit ... but not <i>too</i> much.</p> \n<h3><a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0053604/?ref_=nv_sr_1""><i style=""font-weight: normal;"">The Apartment</i></a></h3> \n<p><iframe width=""560"" height=""315"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/itAYF360Jfc"" frameborder=""0""></iframe></p> \n<p><a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0053604/?ref_=nv_sr_1""><b><i></i></b></a>Writer/director Billy Wilder's classic comedy about a man who finds himself embroiled in something awful in order to get ahead at work is a wonderful look at early 1960s gender politics that won the Oscar for Best Picture. Jack Lemmon is terrific in the lead, and Shirley MacLaine is a wonderfully winsome romantic interest. Plus, the movie's plot intersects with both Christmas <i>and</i> New Year's, so you get two holidays for the price of one.</p> \n<h3><a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0103776/?ref_=nv_sr_3""><i style=""font-weight: normal;"">Batman Returns</i></a></h3> \n<p><iframe frameborder=""0"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/TlbtLfWvFbo"" height=""315"" width=""560""></iframe></p> \n<p><a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0103776/?ref_=nv_sr_3""><b><i></i></b></a>Director Tim Burton often sets his films at Christmastime. (See also: <i>Edward Scissorhands</i>.) But this slice of baroque genius, the follow-up to 1989's megahit <i>Batman</i>, is positively the perfect film for anyone who wants to examine something a bit more macabre as the season settles in. Plus, its dark, wintry atmosphere is just about perfect for those getting in the seasonal mood.</p> \n<h3><a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0095016/?ref_=nv_sr_1""><i style=""font-weight: normal;"">Die Hard</i></a></h3> \n<p><iframe frameborder=""0"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/2TQ-pOvI6Xo"" height=""315"" width=""560""></iframe></p> \n<p><a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0095016/?ref_=nv_sr_1""><b><i></i></b></a>Weirdly, a lot of action movies are set at Christmas, no matter how incongruous that might seem. Blame action screenwriter and director Shane Black, the man responsible for the script for <i>Lethal Weapon</i> and the direction of films like <i>Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang</i> and <i>Iron Man 3, </i>who <i>loves</i> to set his films at Christmastime. That influence spread to other filmmakers, <a href=""http://screencrush.com/iron-man-3-interview-shane-black/"">including those who made </a><a href=""http://screencrush.com/iron-man-3-interview-shane-black/""><i>Die Hard</i></a><i>. </i>This classic action romp, in which John McClane (Bruce Willis) takes down a bunch of terrorists to protect his family, all on Christmas Eve, proves why gunfire and Christmas go together so very well. Ho, ho, ho!</p> \n<h3><a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0083922/?ref_=nv_sr_1""><i style=""font-weight: normal;"">Fanny and Alexander</i></a></h3> \n<p><iframe frameborder=""0"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/7Dasm8PlD2c"" height=""315"" width=""560""></iframe></p> \n<p><a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0083922/?ref_=nv_sr_1""><b><i></i></b></a>This movie qualifies under the ""films that aren't about the holidays but have holiday scenes in them"" category. Swedish director Ingmar Bergman's very loose portrayal of his and his sister's childhood was originally a TV miniseries but retains the feel of an epic in its feature film format, along with one of the most festive, joyous Christmas scenes in all of film. The early-20th-century feast will almost certainly delight.</p> \n<h3><a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087363/?ref_=nv_sr_1""><i style=""font-weight: normal;"">Gremlins</i></a></h3> \n<p><iframe frameborder=""0"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/8nGd36NhmTE"" height=""315"" width=""420""></iframe></p> \n<p><a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087363/?ref_=nv_sr_1""><b><i></i></b></a>There have been a surprising number of horror films set at Christmastime, but this is one of the few that plays as almost gruesomely festive. Joe Dante's elaborate skewering of greeting-card-cover America unleashes a bunch of tiny monsters in the perfect small town as the holidays settle in. It's gory, goofy, and glorious, and it will ensure you never look at a fireplace quite the same way.</p> \n<h3><a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0037059/?ref_=nv_sr_1""><i style=""font-weight: normal;"">Meet Me in St. Louis</i></a></h3> \n<p><iframe frameborder=""0"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/yudgy30Dd68"" height=""315"" width=""420""></iframe></p> \n<p><a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0037059/?ref_=nv_sr_1""><b><i></i></b></a>This is probably cheating, since it's the film that actually spawned the song ""Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas."" It also has a significant portion of its running time set at a Christmas Eve ball. But this is a terrific movie at capturing the slow turn of the seasons, the way that summer becomes fall becomes winter, and it has a great eye for time and place. (It's set in St. Louis in 1904.) Maybe too much of this is set at Christmas to really qualify, but it's still worth seeing anyway.</p> \n<h3><a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0300214/?ref_=nv_sr_1""><i style=""font-weight: normal;"">Morvern Callar</i></a></h3> \n<p><iframe frameborder=""0"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/7Z0lNch5qkQ"" height=""315"" width=""560""></iframe></p> \n<p><a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0300214/?ref_=nv_sr_1""><b><i></i></b></a>This is the one if you have absolutely no wish to engage in holiday cheer. A young woman arrives home on Christmas morning to find that her boyfriend has killed himself. She drifts through the rest of the film in a kind of haze that, nevertheless, makes it seem as if she's almost more alive for having been so closely touched by death. This movie isn't for everyone, but Samantha Morton's lead performance is phenomenal, and the subject matter is decidedly not the typical Christmas movie plot.</p> \n<h3><a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0265666/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1""><i style=""font-weight: normal;"">The Royal Tenenbaums</i></a></h3> \n<p><iframe frameborder=""0"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/fYLpm7tEZiY"" height=""315"" width=""560""></iframe></p> \n<p><a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0265666/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1""><b><i></i></b></a>Though the closest this film comes to actually saying it's set during the holidays is one scene featuring <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hajwg6kxpQ4"">""Christmastime Is Here""</a> from <i>A Charlie Brown Christmas</i> on the soundtrack, it's one of the most wintry films out there, thanks to its gray skies and story of a family coming together just when they need to most. Plus, Mark Mothersbaugh's score gives this a decidedly holiday feel, with its frequent sleigh bells and children's choir oohing away.</p> \n<h3><a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0025878/?ref_=nv_sr_1""><i style=""font-weight: normal;"">The Thin Man</i></a></h3> \n<p><iframe width=""560"" height=""315"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/pkgYjeFYQ2c"" frameborder=""0""></iframe></p> \n<p><a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0025878/?ref_=nv_sr_1""><b><i></i></b></a>Maybe what you need this holiday season is a devilishly clever mystery with even more devilishly clever screwball dialogue. In that case, can I suggest the adventures of Nick and Nora Charles, dashingly sophisticated married sleuths? It's easy to forget this film is set at Christmastime, given how fun it is, but much of it takes place in and around a Christmas Eve party the Charleses throw, and it adds just the right mood to a mystery that's as much fun as unwrapping presents.</p>",Business & Finance
McDonald's is dying in the United States. Thank Chipotle.,http://www.vox.com/2014/12/9/7357125/mcdonalds-sales-decline,"Sales fall 4.6 percent thanks to ""strong competitive activity.""","<ol> \n<li>McDonald's reported Monday that November sales declined 2.2 percent around the world for stores that were open in both 2013 and 2014.</li> \n<li>The decline was led by a 4.6 percent decline in the US market.</li> \n<li>Throughout 2014, McDonald's' sales in US stores have fallen 2.3 percent compared to the previous year.</li> \n<li>The company's official release on the matter blamed the decline on ""strong competitive activity.""</li> \n</ol> \n<h3>McDonald's is in big trouble</h3> \n<p>The huge problem for McDonald's right now is that they're flagging in all three of their major geographical segments. In Europe, sales are falling because of the terrible euro zone economy. In the Asia-Pacific region, sales are falling because of scandals that revealed <a href=""http://www.cnn.com/2014/07/29/world/asia/explainer-china-meat-scandal/"">appalling and unsanitary conditions</a> at the plants supplying stores in China and Japan. And in the United States, sales are falling because of increased competition.</p> \n<p>If you look outside the United States, and then ignore Europe's awful economy, and then ignore the China/Japan scandals you can see the company's underlying strength. Sales are growing in Australia. They are also growing in the ""other countries &amp; corporate"" division that oversees Latin America and Canada. Australia is just really small compared to China, and McDonald's does more business in the USA than in the rest of the Western Hemisphere combined.</p> \n<h3>Chipotle is killing McDonald's</h3> \n<p>Even though the Europe/China/Japan news is bad for the company's bottom line, those setbacks are all survivable. Europe's economy will, probably, recover some day. (And if it doesn't, that's equally problematic for all global retail brands, not just McDonald's.) The supply-chain issues in Asia are fixable. But the US situation should be terrifying for the company. Competition is hard to fix. And that competition is led right now by Chipotle, Wall Street's hottest fast food company.</p> \n<p>Through the end of September, <a href=""http://ir.chipotle.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=194775&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=1979465"">Chipotle opened 132 new restaurants</a>. At the same time, sales in their old restaurants grew 17 percent. There is no sign that America's appetite for giant burritos is anywhere near sated.</p> \n<p>And behind Chipotle stand a broad array of other so-called ""fast casual"" restaurants offering a similar value proposition — fast food service with better-tasting food. Five Guys, In-and-Out Burger, and Shake Shack are all privately held so we don't know their financial details, but they seem to be growing rapidly. And why shouldn't they be? For all of Americans' economic struggles, as a society we are both wealthier and busier than we were a generation ago. Under the circumstances, paying more for tastier food in the quick-service format is a compelling idea and not one that it's clear McDonald's can match.</p> \n<h3>The global future</h3> \n<p>McDonald's says it will revive its US operation by ""diligently working to enhance its marketing, simplify the menu, and implement a more locally-driven organizational structure to increase relevance with consumers.""</p> \n<p>Maybe that will work. But it seems unlikely. It's difficult for a company to change what it is, at root. McDonald's has one of the strongest brand identities on earth. People all around the world know exactly what those golden arches stand for. This has been, traditionally, an enormous source of strength for the company. But it becomes a weakness at a time of tougher competition. From the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTSdUOC8Kac"">McDLT</a> to the Arch Deluxe to the Big N' Tasty, McDonald's has always struggled to sell a ""premium"" burger to the public. It's always been their weak spot, it's just never been a problem before.</p> \n<p>The good news for the company is that the problems in Europe (which is poorer than the USA) and Asia (which is much poorer) really will pass, and the Latin American market opportunity will probably continue to grow. The basic McDonald's value proposition that's increasingly unappealing at home continues to be relevant abroad. Upscaling in the United States will be difficult, but continuing to lean in to globalization is perfectly workable. It just means that the long-term future of what is in many ways <em>the</em> iconic American brand doesn't have much to do with the United States.</p>",Business & Finance

Uniqlo has been expanding in the US [and] also pushing prices down.""</span></p> \n<h3>They've turned their attentions to cell phones instead</h3> \n<p>As that above chart shows, one area where teen spending has grown steadily, even while clothing has fallen off, is electronics. Many teens care more about having fashionable electronic accessories now than high-fashion clothing, as Rachel Harris and Elizabeth Abrams <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/28/business/less-prep-more-plugs-teenagers-favor-tech-over-clothes.html?_r=0"">wrote</a> in the New York Times earlier this year.</p> \n<p>""Apparel is very discretionary and younger consumers aren't as fixated on apparel as previous generations were,"" says Perkins. ""They're spending more on data plans, cable, internet, smartphones, tablets, those types of things, and apparel has become somewhat secondary.""</p> \n<p>This saps money away from clothing in two ways. One, it gets teens spending on electronics, and two, they need wifi on which to operate their gadgets, as the Times <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/28/business/less-prep-more-plugs-teenagers-favor-tech-over-clothes.html?_r=0"" target=""_blank"">wrote</a>. Wander around a city and where does wifi exist? Restaurants. That may be one reason why spending on food has spiked — teens hang out at restaurants more in order to be able to use their new Androids.</p> \n<h3>Malls are dying</h3> \n<p>In the last three years alone, foot traffic at malls has fallen by nearly half, according to this data from Shoppertrak and the Wall Street Journal.</p> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2536086/2014_res_disc_1.0.JPG"" alt=""mall traffic"" data-chorus-asset-id=""2536086""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Source: <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.fidelity.com/viewpoints/investing-ideas/mall-shopping"" style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.65;"">Fidelity</a></p> \n<p><span>What's really depressing here is that even while the change in foot traffic (right axis) seems to be increasing, it's still negative.

And, at the same time, SUVs are coming back in style.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""right"">Sales of SUVs and pick-up trucks rose 9.6% last month</q></p> \n<p>The <i>Guardian </i><a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/money/2014/dec/10/with-cheap-oil-americans-buy-gas-guzzlers-again"" target=""_blank"">reports</a> that US sales of new SUVs and pick-up trucks rose 9.6 percent in November (compared with a 1.3 percent rise in overall vehicle sales). At the same time, fewer Americans are buying small cars. Sales of Ford's Navigator SUV were up 91.5 percent over this time last year, <a href=""http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/15007602-7a3a-11e4-9b34-00144feabdc0.html#axzz3LVa8AjLh"">according to</a> the <i>Financial Times</i>. By contrast, sales of Ford's smaller and popular Fusion were down 11.3 percent.</p> \n<p>The same thing is happening in the much larger used-car market, where prices for mid-sized SUVs, large SUVs, and large trucks have all risen 10 percent or more over the last year. ""Low gas prices has increased consumer demand for these utilitarian vehicles,"" note the car analysts at Edmunds.com.</p> \n<p>Now, these new SUVs aren't all the same as the truck-like behemoths that were popular back in the early 2000s. Many modern SUVs and crossovers tend to be more fuel-efficient and handle more like cars — while still having lots of space. US automakers <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2014-12-03/cheap-oil-wont-help-detroit-sell-gas-guzzlers"">are increasingly putting out</a> more efficient vehicles of all types, thanks in part to stricter fuel-economy standards. Over at Bloomberg, Edward Niedermeyer <a href=""http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2014-12-03/cheap-oil-wont-help-detroit-sell-gas-guzzlers"" target=""_blank"">argues</a> that Americans won't necessarily flock to the gas-guzzlers of old.</p> \n<h3>US fuel economy is now stagnating</h3> \n<p>Still, the move away from smaller cars toward SUVs already seems to be having an effect. Fuel economy in the United States <a href=""http://www.umich.edu/~umtriswt/EDI_sales-weighted-mpg.html"">is now starting to stagnate</a> after improving during the years when gasoline was expensive. Here are the numbers for new vehicles:</p> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""2536496"" alt=""EDI_mpg_November-2014.0.png"" src=""https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2536496/EDI_mpg_November-2014.0.png""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">(University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute)</p> \n<p>Historically, this tends to happens whenever gasoline prices make wild swings. One 2012 <a href=""https://blog.gasbuddy.com/posts/Americans-buy-fuel-efficient-cars-when-prices-rise-then-go-backwards-when-prices-fall-study/1715-499732-1076.aspx"">study</a> from the University of Michigan's Transportation Research Institute found that when gas prices spike, consumers quickly go out and buy smaller, more efficient cars. But when prices drop, they start moving back to SUVs — since they can afford bigger, roomier vehicles.</p> \n<p>How big will this effect be? It's hard to say. Over the past few years, oil consumption in the United States <a href=""http://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2014-america-shakes-off-oil-addiction/"" target=""_blank"">has been falling</a> — as people bought more-efficient vehicles and drove less. Some of that was driven by high gas prices, some by efficiency regulations, and some of it driven by cultural changes (more young people are moving to cities, for instance). Now that gas is getting cheaper, it remains to be seen how much consumption will pick back up.</p> \n<h3>Gas prices may not stay low forever</h3> \n<p>Another thing to keep in mind, meanwhile, is that a car can last for 10 years or more, while gas prices aren't guaranteed to stay low that long. And over the past decade, as this video shows, wild swings in oil prices have become pretty commonplace:</p> \n<p><!-- CHORUS_VIDEO_EMBED ChorusVideo:60648 --></p> \n<p>Something similar could happen again this time around. If new conflicts break out in the Middle East, say, or if China and Europe start growing rapidly again, oil prices could easily shoot back up.</p> \n<h3>Will this affect Obama's fuel efficiency rules?</h3> \n<p>If gas prices <i>do </i>stay low for an extended period of time, that could create a conflict over existing fuel-efficiency rules. The Obama administration has put in place <a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/obama-climate-plan/what-are-u-s-fuel-efficiency-standards-for-cars-and-trucks"" target=""_blank"">fuel-economy standards</a> that will require automakers to keep improving the average fuel-efficiency of their fleet between now and 2025 — at which point the standard will reach 54.5 miles per gallon (which translates to around 35 miles per gallon on the road):</p> \n<p><img alt=""Light_duty_vehicle_standards_1978-2025_0"" class=""photo"" src=""http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/assets/4247139/light_duty_vehicle_standards_1978-2025_0.jpg""></p> \n<p style=""text-align: start;"" class=""caption"">Department of Transportation</p> \n<p>These rules help explain why many of the newer SUVs are a lot more efficient than the truck-like SUVs of old.

Here are seven issues on which we do agree — and we think policy experts across the political spectrum could get behind these common-sense reforms.</p> \n<h3>1) Rein in surveillance by the National Security Agency</h3> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2542446/96263974.0.jpg"" alt=""96263974.0.jpg"" data-chorus-asset-id=""2542446""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">NSA Headquarters. (SAUL LOEB/AFP/Getty Images)</p> \n<p>Last summer, Ed Snowden revealed that the National Security Agency was collecting troves of data on both foreigners and U.S. citizens. In the process, they've also been undermining the security of American products and the internet as a whole. Among other things, we know that the NSA may be:</p> \n<ul> \n<li> <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/06/us/nsa-foils-much-internet-encryption.html?_r=0"">secretly weakening</a> essential encryption tools and standards; </li> \n<li>attempting to <a href=""http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/catalog-reveals-nsa-has-back-doors-for-numerous-devices-a-940994.html"">insert back doors</a> into common software and hardware;</li> \n<li> <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/13/us/politics/obama-lets-nsa-exploit-some-internet-flaws-officials-say.html"">stockpiling \tinformation</a> about security flaws in the commercial software we use every day rather than notifying \tthe companies so that the holes can get fixed;</li> \n<li>and even <a href=""http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/ghcq-targets-engineers-with-fake-linkedin-pages-a-932821.html"">impersonating popular sites</a> like Facebook and LinkedIn to inject malware.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>This behavior is bad for online security, and it could lead to <a href=""http://oti.newamerica.net/publications/policy/surveillance_costs_the_nsas_impact_on_the_economy_internet_freedom_cybersecurity"">billions of dollars</a> in losses because domestic and foreign customers are increasingly concerned about whether they’re more vulnerable to NSA surveillance if they use American products.</p> \n<p>So the NSA's actions have not only eroded our civil liberties and harmed U.S. credibility around the world; they are also damaging America's technology sector. As a result, there's growing support for reforms that would rein in the power of the NSA.</p> \n<p>The leading NSA reform proposal is the USA FREEDOM Act, which limits bulk collection of Americans' calling and internet records under the Patriot Act. The legislation enjoys support from <a href=""http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Freformgs.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F102821955852%2Fopen-letter-to-the-us-senate&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNGQL_o683Ck0Wp8x4hdwvLo78gNGw"">technology companies</a> and <a href=""http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Foti.newamerica.net%2Fsites%2Fnewamerica.net%2Ffiles%2Fprogram_pages%2Fattachments%2FCoalition%2520Letter%2520Supporting%2520USA%2520FREEDOM-%2520Opposing%2520Data%2520Retention_CISA_9%25204%252014.pdf&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNHNNXkY-HgkvN5KWIu4e6gmP5WNgQ"">privacy advocates</a>, but unfortunately, the effort to get a Senate vote on the bill during the lame duck session <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/11/18/7241987/usa-freedom-senate-vote"">failed</a>. So Congress won't pass meaningful surveillance reform this year.</p> \n<p>The issue will come up again next year because key provisions of the Patriot Act are scheduled to expire next summer — including the provision the government cites to justify bulk surveillance of Americans' phone and internet records. But reforming that provision wouldn't be enough on its own. The NSA relies on other legal authorities, including the 2008 FISA Amendments Act and a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_12333"">controversial executive order</a> to justify spying on Americans. Stricter limits on all of these legal powers will be needed to rebuild the trust of individuals, companies, and governments around the world.</p> \n<h3>2) Get rid of bad software patents</h3> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""2542520"" alt=""3293465641_b6c5081e87_b.0.jpg"" src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2542520/3293465641_b6c5081e87_b.0.jpg""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">(<a href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/60588258@N00/3293465641/in/photolist-622SAn-8Cp6in-nx85fR-63UDyk-zTq7f-63UDAr-bkUna-4yab3n-dvMZm5-63UDLR-68qMei-e6yiVM-5RTLRR-L2QQD-7UToH-JM6wH-e4wRz6-52Zvuz-iR9Qu-JFdeS-7u8DRu-5RTQnV-9U4rk9-5RTFQR-HWypm-5RYbLJ-5RYbhG-4izZg2-9U4rkf-7u8E5L-AuHb5-5RYccQ-5RTQSc-5RY2fw-5RY5fU-5RTJbv-5RY52U-45YPB-5RTHvB-5RYcpQ-5RXZBs-5RTPmD-5RY3BQ-5RXWFY-5RTRU2-diemDY-cxdsZm-hSgKH-nyeBRi-m9ZwmU"" target=""_blank"">Brian Turner</a>)</p> \n<p><span>Patent trolling — when patent holders exploit flaws in the legal system to extort meritless settlements — is a </span><a href=""http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2012/07/new-study-same-authors-patent-trolls-cost-economy-29-billion-yearly/"" style=""font-size: 1.15em; line-height: 1.65; background-color: #ffffff;"">multi-billion-dollar problem</a><span>.

The deeper problem is that patents are being granted for inventions that are broad, vague, obvious, or difficult to definitively classify. This problem is especially acute for patents on software and business methods. If it is too easy to inadvertently infringe on a patent, or if it is too difficult to know when you are infringing on a patent, that is going to lead to a lot of pointless lawsuits.</p> \n<p>Recent Supreme Court <a href=""http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.vox.com%2F2014%2F9%2F12%2F6138483%2Fsoftware-patents-are-crumbling-thanks-to-the-supreme-court&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFBoNJjJmojWe1kh5CIq_-bC5-v0w"">decisions</a> have begun disallowing some patents for software algorithms or methods of doing business on the grounds that they are too abstract. But Congress could go further, changing the law to prevent low-quality software and business method patents from being granted in the first place.</p> \n<h3>3) Reduce excessive copyright protections</h3> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""2542488"" alt=""102909703.0.jpg"" src=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2542488/102909703.0.jpg""></p> \n<p class=""caption""><span>Due to copyright extensions, decades-old works like the 1939 film </span><i style=""color: #6f96a8; font-size: 0.8em; text-align: inherit; line-height: 1.65; background-color: initial;"">Gone with the Wind</i><span> have not fallen into the public domain. (Silver Screen Collection/Archive Photos/Getty Images)</span></p> \n<p>Copyright is supposed to reward creativity so we end up with more creative works for everyone to enjoy. But over time, copyright holders have lobbied for more and more protection, eating into the public's ability to enjoy and build upon the fruit of that creativity.</p> \n<p>Copyright terms have expanded — typically to the life of the author plus 70 years — beyond the point where they could plausibly be offering additional incentives for creators. These term extensions, awarded retroactively, provide a nice payout to those copyright holders who happen to own blockbuster content.</p> \n<p>As a result of a 20-year term extension in 1998, no new works are slated to enter the public domain until 2019. These changes hurt the public by limiting access to our cultural heritage, and there's little evidence they've caused more works to be created. We should be debating whether to shorten terms, rather than lengthening them further.</p> \n<p>Copyright law is also coming into conflict with 21st-century technology. For example, anti-circumvention laws intended to prevent piracy may have made it illegal to unlock a cell phone. Although Congress <a href=""http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cnet.com%2Fnews%2Fpresident-signs-cell-phone-unlocking-bill-into-law%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNGv81z4NdDzaaHm1-ndNlgincmPug"">passed a law</a> this year narrowly (and <a href=""https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.publicknowledge.org%2Fnews-blog%2Fblogs%2Fpublic-knowledge-consumers-petition-copyright-office-for-right-to-unlock-ac&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFiPTvX9889C8wgeRxhXcz1v4Wo6Q"">temporarily</a>) addressing cell phone unlocking, companies continue to use these anti-circumvention provisions in ways that have more to do with stifling competition than preventing piracy. For example, circumventing access controls is necessary if you want to use a third-party printer cartridge, garage door opener, or auto mechanic. Copyright law should be used to reward creative works, not to lock down devices so they can only be used in one particular way.</p> \n<h3>4) Don't weaken smartphone encryption</h3> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""2542494"" alt=""181281527__1_.0.jpg"" src=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2542494/181281527__1_.0.jpg""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">(Lintao Zhang/Getty Images)</p> \n<p><span>This fall, both </span><a style=""font-size: 1.15em; line-height: 1.65; background-color: #ffffff;"" href=""https://www.apple.com/privacy/"">Apple</a><span> and </span><a style=""font-size: 1.15em; line-height: 1.65; background-color: #ffffff;"" href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2014/09/18/newest-androids-will-join-iphones-in-offering-default-encryption-blocking-police/?wpisrc=nl-swbd&amp;wpmm=1"">Google</a><span> announced that they plan to move toward full smartphone encryption by default, meaning that all user data stored on iPhones or Android devices will be protected from the prying eyes of the government, not to mention criminals and the companies themselves.

Comey and other law enforcement advocates suggest that if the trend continues, Congress should require companies to build ""back doors"" into their products to so that police officers can — after getting a warrant — access user data.</p> \n<p>But that's a bad idea. Strong encryption is good for free speech, personal privacy, and the security of the internet as a whole. By contrast, mandating insecurity to preserve wiretap capabilities is a risky proposition, because even if the intent is to provide only law enforcement with access, it's possible that criminals or foreign intelligence agencies may also discover and exploit these vulnerabilities. Beyond the cybersecurity concerns, backdoors also threaten our information economy, as customers in foreign markets like China have long been wary of American products that may contain government-mandated vulnerabilities.</p> \n<h2>5) Free up more electromagnetic frequencies to speed up mobile networks</h2> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""2542512"" alt=""13089721895_0b48140d00_h__1_.0.jpg"" src=""https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2542512/13089721895_0b48140d00_h__1_.0.jpg""></p> \n<p class=""caption""><span>(</span><a href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/chiropractic/13089721895/in/photolist-c9jgUU-oNiyAf-ckM3BA-ggFQBX-a51XSe-pLd7WV-4a1m7o-rqLXC-rqLWq-bmLht9-nWTM9w-kWGfhg-yJgPq-6bcrEw-owrpfv-9kUyso-n1vBFC-cZcvu7-cZcB7b-cZcBRh"" target=""_blank"">Michael Dorausch</a><span>)</span></p> \n<p>As mobile data traffic grows every year, demand for wireless spectrum grows too. This spectrum is incredibly valuable. Federal officials are currently auctioning a 65 MHz slice of spectrum that is expected to yield over $40 billion — twice the amount originally anticipated.</p> \n<p>There's a lot of room for improvement in the way the US manages spectrum resources. Large swaths of spectrum are underutilized. That's particularly true of the 1500 Mhz or so that the U.S. government currently uses. Government spectrum could be worth as much as a trillion dollars.</p> \n<p>Repurposing some of this spectrum for mobile connectivity or other high-value uses is a no-brainer. If parts of this spectrum were sold, it would raise billions of dollars for the government. Other spectrum should be earmarked as ""unlicensed"" spectrum — a classification that enables free wireless technologies like wifi. We expect technology companies will use this free spectrum to produce innovative new wireless technologies.</p> \n<h3>6) Remove government oversight of internet names and addresses</h3> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""2542498"" alt=""474661545.0.jpg"" src=""https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2542498/474661545.0.jpg""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Commerce Secretary Penny Pritzker (Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)</p> \n<p><span>This March, the Commerce Department's National Telecommunications and Information Association (NTIA) made a quiet but important announcement about the future of the internet’s naming and numbering system: possibly as soon as in 2015, it intends to end its oversight over the allocation of domain names and internet addresses.</span></p> \n<p>The U.S. has been responsible for coordinating these activities since the internet's inception, primarily because the internet originated as a U.S. military experiment. But it's increasingly difficult to defend the Commerce Department exercising unilateral authority over a global resource that is relied upon by billions of non-Americans. The process of deciding what organization or coalition will take over from NTIA is currently underway, with input from the public and key stakeholders being considered.</p> \n<p>Some members of Congress have overreacted to the announcement and seem ready to oppose anything that relinquishes U.S. ""<a href=""http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2014/03/control-of-the-internet-104830.html"">control</a>"" over the internet. But coordinating the internet's naming and numbering system is a largely technical and uncontroversial function that can easily be handled without government involvement.</p> \n<p>The NTIA has laid out a set of criteria that must be met before the transition will occur, and has repeatedly said there is no firm deadline — the oversight contract can be extended temporarily if the multistakeholder community isn't quite ready in October 2015, when the current contract runs out. There’s little reason to worry since one of NTIA’s clear red lines is opposing any proposal that would give this oversight authority to foreign governments.</p> \n<p>By contrast, interfering with the process could actually create the negative backlash that members of Congress seem so concerned about. A good-faith effort by the United States to responsibly transition oversight to the global community will help rebuild U.S. credibility — and an attempt to go back on our word will lend credence and momentum to advocates of sharing this authority with other national governments. The real risk to the free and open internet will come if we never go through with the transition at all. Speaking of which…</p> \n<h3>7) Don't let the United Nations expand its role in internet governance</h3> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""2542506"" alt=""102667822.0.jpg"" src=""https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2542506/102667822.0.jpg""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">(Chris Jackson/Getty Images)</p> \n<p><span>If you've heard rumors about a possible ""UN takeover of the internet"" in the past few years, chances are they're referring to the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), a little-known UN agency which is responsible for the interoperability of global telecommunications networks. Concerns about efforts to broaden the ITU's role in internet governance have been growing since 2012, when a stark division emerged at the ITU's </span><a style=""font-size: 1.15em; line-height: 1.65; background-color: #ffffff;"" href=""http://www.itu.int/en/wcit-12/Pages/default.aspx"">World Conference on International Telecommunications</a><span> (WCIT) about whether to include references to the internet in a treaty revision.</span></p> \n<p>A number of countries, including the United States and many European allies, argued that the ITU is not the right place to discuss internet public policy — and that broadening its mandate could harm the open and free internet. These critics ultimately walked out of the WCIT without signing the revised treaty because of the inclusion of references to internet-related issues. Similar concerns <a href=""http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.washingtonpost.com%2Fblogs%2Fthe-switch%2Fwp%2F2014%2F10%2F20%2Fheres-how-the-u-s-plans-to-avoid-a-u-n-vote-on-the-future-of-the-internet%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFI5gMgtS7x5FBezVv3qxgl15C6EA"">resurfaced earlier this fall</a> prior to an ITU meeting in Busan, South Korea, where some governments tried to push proposals that could <a href=""http://www.cfr.org/internet-policy/itu-unbundling-internet-governance/p33656"">fundamentally change</a> the way the internet works on a technical level or impose international regulation on global peering and interconnection.</p> \n<p>There are numerous problems with expanding the ITU's role in internet governance. For starters, despite taking some positive steps in the past few years, the ITU remains one of the most closed institutions involved in the internet governance arena. Moreover, because the ITU is a UN agency, governments are the primary stakeholders.</p> \n<p>That's a stark contrast to most internet governance organizations, where companies, non-profit organizations, and academia participate on an equal footing with governments and can advocate for policies that protect the interests of internet users. Countries like Russia, China, and Saudi Arabia want to expand the ITU's role in internet governance, probably because they believe they'll get a more sympathetic hearing from a secretive body that prioritizes the views of governments over other organizations.</p> \n<p>The negotiations in Korea <a href=""http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Ftechnology%2F2014%2Fnov%2F07%2Fhow-will-internet-governance-change-after-the-itu-conference&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNH2A7wqVJwvmwuijRmWpRtMe8BYgA"">went much more smoothly</a> than they did at the WCIT two years ago, which has prompted some to declare victory and proclaim this a turning point for the ITU. But it's far too early to really gauge the impact of the 2014 meeting or to predict with real confidence that the proposals that were struck down in Busan will not rear their heads again in the next few years. Making sure that public policy debates about interconnection, cybersecurity, and resource allocation stay out of the ITU is still an important goal for protecting the internet we know and love.</p> \n<p><em>Eli Dourado is the director of the Technology Policy Program at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University.

Uber's Sydney fiasco: the problem with surge pricing is everyone hates it,http://www.vox.com/2014/12/15/7394323/uber-surge-pricing-psychology,"From the hostage crisis to Saturday night restaurant reservations, people like flat prices.","<p>Taxi cabs often become scarce during bad weather or other scenarios that lead to a surge in demand. Uber has developed an economist-friendly solution to the problem — raise prices when demand spikes. But it's a solution that keeps getting the company into trouble, most recently when Uber Sydney tweeted that surge pricing would be in effect in the wake of the hostage crisis that unfolded over the past twelve hours.</p> \n<blockquote lang=""en"" class=""twitter-tweet""> \n<p>We are all concerned with events in CBD. Fares have increased to encourage more drivers to come online &amp; pick up passengers in the area.</p> \n— Uber Sydney (@Uber_Sydney) <a href=""https://twitter.com/Uber_Sydney/status/544319760809222144"">December 15, 2014</a>\n</blockquote> \n<p><span>The backlash was </span><a style=""font-size: 1.15em; line-height: 1.65; background-color: #ffffff;"" href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2014/12/15/uber-backtracks-after-jacking-up-prices-during-syndey-hostage-crisis/"">fast and furious</a><span> and the company immediately backed down.</span></p> \n<h3>People hate variable pricing</h3> \n<p>The basic economic logic of raising prices when demand surges is hard to argue with. If you got a job offer at 2:00 PM, and then immediately got a second job offer at 2:05 PM you would negotiate with both potential employers (and your current boss) for the best overall job — not feel compelled to take the offer that happens to have come in first.</p> \n<p>Cold hearted rationalists like me have often wondered why this logic is not more broadly applied in business life.</p> \n<p>Why do concerts and sports events regularly sell out leaving thousands of fans out in the cold, rather than featuring prices high enough to roughly balance supply and demand? Why don't popular restaurants charge more for a 7:30 PM reservation on a Saturday night than for a 9:00 PM reservation on a Wednesday? Why does the hardware store run out of salt during snowstorms rather than hiking prices?</p> \n<p>The endless cycle of backlashes provoked by Uber's efforts to apply variable pricing to a consumer good help us understand these puzzling economic questions — <em>people really hate it and it hurts your brand. </em>People would rather see inefficient allocations of scarce goods, lower overall supply, less total employment and job creation, and perennial shortages than let prices float up and down according to demand.</p> \n<h3>Can Uber make this work?</h3> \n<p>Uber's stubborn refusal to conform in this regard is, in a way, admirable since it gives us all something to talk and think about. Can they make it work?</p> \n<p>One possible solution would be to copy the major consumer-facing industries that <em>do</em> impose variable pricing — hotels and airlines. The way these companies generally manage to get away with it is through a massive lack of transparency. You can't look up ""the price"" of a United flight from Newark to Chicago, and then see whether the price at any particular time reflects a surge multiple of the base or not. You need to go online, try to book a flight, and then just see what they want to charge. Hotels operate the same way.</p> \n<p>In both cases, the actual price-determining formulae are much more complicated than Uber's surge multiples. Consumers don't exactly love these industries, but by making it unclear when prices have spiked, airlines manage to get away without storms of social media outrage over spiking prices.</p> \n<p>Many retailers accomplish something similar by making the ""official"" price ridiculously high, and then offering various discounts. At JC Penny, the question is whether your shirt will be 25 percent off or just 15 percent off, a non-transparent framing of surge pricing that people seem to like better.</p> \n<h3>A windfall for drivers?</h3> \n<p>Another idea would be to give all the surge revenue to drivers.</p> \n<p>Right now, an Uber fare is an 80:20 split between the driver and the company. So when fares rocket up to 3X, Uber gets much more revenue per rider. Uber could structure it's surge pricing so that the company's revenue per rider does not rise when surge pricing is in effect, instead directing <em>all</em> the surplus to the driver of the car. Since more drivers will drive when their wages are higher, this would still lead Uber with more revenue at high-demand periods than at low-demand periods. But riders might be more sympathetic to the idea of a windfall landing in the pocket of a driver than of a well-financed tech company.</p> \n<p>I am a little skeptical this will work. The fact that restaurants and bands don't attempt surge pricing suggests that public resentment of variable prices is fundamentally about public resentment of variable prices and not about resentment of rich technology companies.</p> \n<h3>A huge public policy challenge</h3> \n<p>Popular hatred of demand-responsive pricing is in many ways a huge challenge for transportation policy. That's because most wonky analysts think <em>the government</em> should be acting more like Uber, while most people seem to want the government to force Uber to stop acting like Uber.</p> \n<p>Rather than under-pricing street parking and leading to constant shortages and fights, <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/6/27/5849280/why-free-parking-is-bad-for-everyone"">cities should be charging market rates for scarce space</a>. This would both make it easier to find parking, and generate a big new stream of revenue that could be used to boost incomes (through lower sales taxes) or increase public service levels. Similarly, traffic jams could be made a thing of the past through congestion pricing on roads. Here, again, demand-responsive pricing would not only help address a specific problem, but unleash a gusher of useful revenue.</p> \n<p>These are good ideas and well-known in the policy community, but they're rarely implemented. That's presumably for the same reason it's hard, but not necessarily expensive, to get a table at a popular restaurant on the weekend — politicians fear the public backlash.</p>",Business & Finance
Why we shouldn't be surprised hackers could get into Sony's network,http://www.vox.com/2014/12/16/7401331/why-we-shouldnt-be-surprised-hackers-could-get-into-sonys-network,A security expert argues that most corporate networks are vulnerable to hacking.,"<p>Testifying before Congress last week, the FBI's Joseph Demarest <a href=""http://arstechnica.com/security/2014/12/sony-hackers-could-have-slipped-past-90-of-defenses-fbi-director-says/"">played up</a> the sophistication of the hackers who <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/12/14/7387945/sony-hack-explained"">broke into the network of Sony Pictures.</a> ""The malware that was used would have slipped or probably gotten past 90 percent of Net defenses that are out there,"" he said.</p> \n<p>But this doesn't impress security expert Robert Graham, who argues you don't have to be very sophisticated to break into a corporate network. He <a href=""http://blog.erratasec.com/2014/12/all-malware-defeats-90-of-defenses.html#.VI9wnlfF_6J"">describes one case</a> where his firm was hired for ""penetration testing"" — attempting to break into the company's network to test its security.</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>We had some USB drives made with the logo of the corporation we were pen-testing. We grabbed a flash game off the Internet, changed the graphics so that they were punching the logo of their main competitor, and put text in the Final Score screen suggesting ""email this to your friends and see what they get"". We then added some malware components to it. We then dropped the USB drives in the parking lot.</p> \n<p>This gave us everything in the company as people passed the game around. The CEO and many high-level executives ran it on their machines. Sysadmins ran it. Once we got control of the central domain controller, we got access to everything: all files, all emails, ... <em>everything</em>.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>This story illustrates a couple of lessons about corporate security. First, one of the biggest challenges in corporate security is employee training. A company can have the strongest possible defenses against external enemies, but there's no getting around the need for the company's own employees to access sensitive information. If a hacker can trick a few of those employees into doing something dumb, like running a program found on a USB drive or typing a password into a hacker-owned website, then the attacker can get the same permissions as the trusted employee.</p> \n<p>There are precautions network administrators can take against this kind of attack, but they tend to make it harder for employees to do their jobs. It might have been possible for the company Graham attacked to ban employees from putting USB drives in their computers, but that would have created headaches when they actually needed to get information off of a USB drive. So there's constant pressure for security measures to be relaxed in the name of efficiency, leaving a lot of vulnerabilities for the first group to make a serious effort to exploit them.</p>",Business & Finance

It's bringing back cheap gasoline to the United States while wreaking havoc on oil-producing countries like Russia and Venezuela.</p> \n<p>But <i>why</i> does the price of oil keep falling? Back in June 2014, the price of Brent crude was up around $115 per barrel. As of January 23, 2015, it had fallen by more than half, down to <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.nasdaq.com/markets/crude-oil-brent.aspx?timeframe=10y"">$49 per barrel</a>:</p> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3332718/oilprice_jan23.0.png"" alt=""oilprice_jan23.0.png"" data-chorus-asset-id=""3332718""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Spot price of Brent Crude, updated on January 23, 2015 (Joss Fong/Vox)</p> \n<p>The short version of the story goes like this: For much of the past decade, oil prices have been high — bouncing around $100 per barrel since 2010 — because of soaring oil consumption in countries like China and conflicts in key oil nations like Iraq. Oil production in conventional fields couldn't keep up with demand, so prices spiked.</p> \n<p><q class=""right"" aria-hidden=""true"">By 2014, oil supply was much higher than demand</q></p> \n<p>But beneath the surface, many of those dynamics were rapidly shifting. High prices spurred companies in the US and Canada <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/10/2/6892781/how-the-oil-and-gas-boom-is-changing-america"" target=""_blank"">to start drilling for new, hard-to-extract crude</a> in North Dakota's shale formations and Alberta's oil sands. Then, over the last year, demand for oil in places like Europe, Asia, and the US began tapering off, thanks to weakening economies and new efficiency measures.</p> \n<p>By late 2014, world oil supply was on track to rise much higher than actual demand, as the chart below <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.iea.org/oilmarketreport/omrpublic/"">from the International Energy Agency</a> shows. A lot of unused oil was simply being stockpiled away for later. So, in September, prices started falling sharply.</p> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2559242/supply_vs_demand.0.png"" alt=""supply_vs_demand.0.png"" data-chorus-asset-id=""2559242""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">(<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.iea.org/oilmarketreport/omrpublic/"">International Energy Agency</a>)</p> \n<p>As prices slid, many observers waited to see whether OPEC, the world's largest oil cartel, would cut back on production to push prices back up.

But at its big meeting last November, <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/11/28/7302827/oil-prices-opec"">OPEC did nothing</a>. Saudi Arabia didn't want to give up market share and refused to cut production — in the hopes that lower prices would help throttle the US shale boom. That was a surprise.

Low prices are excellent news for oil consumers in places like Japan or the US, where gasoline is the cheapest it's been in years. But it's a different story for nations reliant on oil sales.

Oil prices were rising sharply because global demand was surging — especially in China — and there simply wasn't enough oil production to keep up. That led to large price spikes, and oil hovered around $100 per barrel between 2011 and 2014.</p> \n<p>Yet as oil prices increased, many energy companies found it profitable to begin extracting oil from difficult-to-drill places. In the United States, companies began using techniques like fracking and horizontal drilling <a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/fracking/how-has-fracking-boosted-u-s-oil-and-gas-production"">to extract oil from shale formations</a> in North Dakota and Texas. In Canada, companies were heating Alberta's gooey oil sands with steam to extract usable crude.</p> \n<p>This led to a boom in ""unconventional"" oil production. The US alone <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.vox.com/xpress/2014/11/17/7236379/the-united-states-hasnt-produced-this-much-oil-since-1986"">has added</a> 4 million extra barrels of crude oil per day to the global market since 2008.

The result was that prices <i>kept</i> declining anyway and Saudi Arabia simply lost market share. What's more, the Saudis <a style=""font-size: 17px; line-height: 28.4624996185303px; background-color: #ffffff;"" target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/10/13/us-oil-saudi-policy-idUSKCN0I201Y20141013"">have signaled </a>that they can live with lower prices in the short term.

""We will produce 30 million barrels a day for the next 6 months, and we will watch to see how the market behaves,"" said OPEC Secretary-General Abdalla El-Badri after the meeting.</p> \n<p>That caused the price of oil <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/11/28/7302827/oil-prices-opec"">to start crashing even further</a>. The price of Brent crude went from $80 per barrel to $70 per barrel in just a few days.

What that means is that it's relatively cheap to pump oil out of places like Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. But it's more expensive to extract oil from shale formations in places like Texas and North Dakota.

At least that's what OPEC members hope.</p> \n<h3>A big question: Will low oil prices kill the US shale boom?</h3> \n<p>By January 2015, it was clear that low prices were starting to pinch producers in the United States and Canada.

Others may try to cut their costs and grit it out. It really varies from company to company. What's more, the situation is different up in Canada: oil sands projects have huge upfront costs, but once those are paid off, they can keep producing oil cheaply for many decades.</p> \n<p><span>That all makes it hard to predict how this all shakes out — or where global oil prices will bottom out. </span>The US Energy Information Administration <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.cfm?id=19171&amp;src=email"">still expects</a> that overall US oil production will grow another 700,000 barrels per day in 2015 — though that's slightly lower than the prediction when prices were high.

(Maxim Shipenkov/AFP/Getty Images)</p> \n<p>The plunge in oil prices is having significant economic consequences around the world. A few examples:</p> \n<p><b>Russia:</b> Russia's situation is getting the most attention these days. The country's is hugely dependent on oil and gas production — with oil revenues making up 45 percent of the government budget — and the sharp fall on prices has been ruinous.</p> \n<p><q class=""right"" aria-hidden=""true"">Russia's economy is expected to shrink 4.5% next year if oil stays at $60 per barrel</q></p> \n<p>Economists now estimate that Russia's GDP <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-12-15/russia-sees-economy-shrinking-at-least-4-5-in-2015-with-60-oil.html"">will shrink at least 4.5 percent</a> in 2015 if oil says below $60 per barrel. The plunging price of oil has also caused the ruble's value to collapse — which is leading to panic inside Russia and a rise in inflation, as imports become drastically more expensive. Many Russians, worried that their savings may vanish, <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/17/business/russia-ruble-interest-rates.html"">have been rushing out</a> to buy cars and washing machines — anything that has more lasting value than currency.</p> \n<p>So far, Russia's central bank has been struggling to deal with this crisis. On December 15, 2014, the country <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/12/16/7401401/ruble-collapse-interest-rates"">suddenly hiked interest rates from 10.5 percent to 17 percent</a> in an attempt to stop people from selling off rubles. But those rate hikes are likely to slow the country's economy down even further.</p> \n<p><b>Iran: </b>Iran's economy had recently started to rebound after years of recession. The International Monetary Fund <a href=""http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-10-11/iran-central-bank-s-seif-says-sanction-won-t-stop-growth.html"">had been projecting</a> that the country was on track to grow 2.3 percent next year. But that was all before oil prices started to plunge — a potentially precarious situation for the country.</p> \n<p>One big problem for Iran is that it also needs oil prices well north of $100 per barrel to balance its budget, especially since Western sanctions have made it much harder to export crude. If oil prices keep falling, the Iranian government may need to make up revenues elsewhere — say, by paring back domestic fuel subsidies (always an unpopular move, at least in the short term).</p> \n<p><b>Venezuela:</b> There's <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/aaa13660-795e-11e4-a57d-00144feabdc0.html"">growing concern</a> that the oil crash could cause Venezuela, another major oil producer, to default.

Bitcoin has become too powerful for regulators to shut it down,http://www.vox.com/2014/12/16/7403507/bitcoin-has-become-too-powerful-for-regulators-to-shut-it-down,"If the feds wanted to shut down the Bitcoin network, they should have done so in 2013.","<p>I'm a Bitcoin optimist. Henry Farrell isn't. In an <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2014/12/16/bitcoins-financial-network-is-doomed/"">astute post</a>, he argues that the big threat to Bitcoin's long-term viability comes from government regulation. Governments are used to being able to control how the financial system works, and the Bitcoin network's decentralized structure threatens that control. So, Farrell argues, if Bitcoin ever really takes off, regulators will try to destroy it.</p> \n<p>This is a smart argument. Indeed, <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/05/15/the-coming-political-battle-over-bitcoin/"">I believed it</a> a couple of years ago. The problem is that it's a couple of years out of date. If regulators were going to try to shut down the Bitcoin network, they needed to do it in 2012 or 2013, not 2015.</p> \n<p>In early 2013, Bitcoin was best known as the payment system used by the drug marketplace Silk Road. It wouldn't have been surprising if federal officials had taken a hostile stance toward the system. But a <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2013/11/21/heres-how-bitcoin-charmed-washington/"">savvy lobbying campaign</a> from Bitcoin supporters convinced the feds that the smart play was to make peace with Bitcoin rather than to fight it.</p> \n<p>Advocates' argument was simple: Bitcoin was so decentralized and globalized that it would be impossible to drive it out of existence. Even if it was suppressed in the US, the network would continue operating overseas. Americans could use anonymizing technologies like Tor to access it. But if US officials tried to stamp it out, they'd destroy legitimate Bitcoin businesses and with them any influence over how the Bitcoin economy evolved. In particular, they'd lose the ability to subpoena the records of Bitcoin companies to help them trace Bitcoin transactions.</p> \n<p>Regulators seem to have bought this argument. When the Senate held hearings on Bitcoin in November 2013, <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2013/11/18/this-senate-hearing-is-a-bitcoin-lovefest/"">they were lovefests</a>, with key regulators emphasizing the need to accommodate legitimate Bitcoin applications, even as they cracked down on illegal uses. Sen. Tom Carper, who chaired one of the hearings, drew an explicit parallel to the early internet. ""Innovation is a very important part of our economy,"" said Jennifer Calvery, the woman who enforces the nation's money laundering laws. Mythili Raman of the Justice Department talked about Bitcoin's ""many legitimate uses.""</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""right""><span>Bitcoin has more powerful allies than it did two years ago</span></q></p> \n<p>And remember, this hearing happened after federal officials <a href=""http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/05/feds-seize-money-from-top-bitcoin-exchange-mt-gox/"">seized assets</a> belonging to Mt. Gox, which was then the leading Bitcoin exchange and would later declare bankruptcy. It was mere weeks after the feds <a href=""http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/10/feds-shut-down-silk-road-arrest-alleged-admin-dread-pirate-roberts/"">shut down</a> the Bitcoin-based drug marketplace Silk Road. In short, the feds at that point were under no illusions that the technology would only be used for legitimate purposes.</p> \n<p>Farrell argues that the government's attitude will change if Bitcoin ever becomes popular enough to pose a real threat to conventional, regulated financial networks. But I think that gets things  backwards. Bitcoin will only grow enough to be economically significant if a lot of legitimate businesses start to rely on it. But the more legitimate users the network has, the more politically difficult it will become to shut it down.</p> \n<p>Bitcoin already has more powerful allies than it did two years ago. In 2014 alone, <a href=""http://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-venture-capital/"">dozens of Bitcoin startups</a> have raised money. Their backers aren't going to stand idly by while the government destroys their investments. For example, influential pro-Bitcoin venture capitalists, including Marc Andreessen and Fred Wilson, have pooled their resources to create a new Bitcoin advocacy organization called the <a href=""http://www.coindesk.com/coin-center-bitcoin-advocacy-launch/"">Coin Center</a>.</p> \n<p>And of course the arguments that persuaded regulators in 2013 are still true. The Bitcoin network probably can't be shut down; it can only be driven underground. Doing so won't prevent serious criminals from using it, but it will make it harder for law enforcement to track down people using the network. And Bitcoin has good applications as well as bad ones. After going before Congress and endorsing these arguments last year, it would be awkward for regulators to do an about-face and declare war on the technology.</p> \n<p>In short, if the regulators were going to try to shut down Bitcoin, they would have done it two years ago when it was still a fringe technology with no real support among elites. Now it's too late.</p>",Business & Finance

But while we cheer the cheaper driving, there's another trend to cheer: the growing economy just doesn't need gasoline quite like it once did.</p> \n<p>Total miles driven per dollar of GDP have fallen off dramatically in the last 20 years. The number of gallons of gas consumed per dollar of GDP has been falling for even longer. That's according to a new report from Michael Sivak, a research professor at the University of Michigan's Transportation Research Institute.</p> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2647024/Screen_Shot_2014-12-17_at_9.42.02_AM.0.png"" alt=""GDP gasoline"" data-chorus-asset-id=""2647024""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Source: Michael Sivak</p> \n<p><span>Lots of factors contribute to this. The declining number of gallons consumed is in part a function of more efficient cars. And more public transit ridership has probably also helped to keep the number of miles driven in check. The recession may have also caused people to cut back on their driving.</span></p> \n<p>But part of what's happening is that economic health has grown increasingly decoupled from how much we drive. Sivak points out that not only has everyday driving fallen off, but truck-driving's contribution to GDP has also declined. Meanwhile, areas of the economy that are not transportation-intensive — internet publishing and data processing, for example — have seen explosive growth. Likewise, e-commerce has grown while shopping at actual, physical stores has been flat.</p> \n<p>It's not that low gas prices aren't great for some people's personal finances — as the Wall Street Journal's <a href=""http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2014/12/01/lower-gas-prices-how-big-a-boost-for-the-economy/"" target=""_blank"">Nick Timiraos</a> writes, lower prices ""could be a particularly progressive tax cut because lower-income households are particularly sensitive to increases in energy prices."" So low prices could create an economic boost in the sense of boosting some consumer spending and maybe even driving. But economic growth and driving aren't as tightly linked as they once were.</p>",Business & Finance

A single word — patient — sent the stock market on a two-day rally that's the best since 2011.</p> \n<p>So here's the most important line in the statement and why it matters:</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>Based on its current assessment, the Committee judges that it can be patient in beginning to normalize the stance of monetary policy.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Boring, right? But it's a big deal because for quite a while now, Fed statements have said that even after the end of Quantitative Easing, there would be no interest rate hikes ""for a considerable period."" Since time passes between each statement, pressure was building for a change in phrase that would take the passage of time into account. At the same time, the economy has been getting stronger — we've had three good jobs reports in a row. So the question was building as to whether the ""considerable period of time"" language would change in a way that indicates Yellen is thinking of raising rates sooner than seemed appropriate back in the October meeting.</p> \n<p>The meaning of this patient business is supposed to reassure people that the language is changing, but the policy is not. Later, the statement says that ""the Committee sees this guidance as consistent with its previous statement that it likely will be appropriate to maintain the 0 to 1/4 percent target range for the federal funds rate for a considerable time.""</p> \n<p>Long story short, time has passed, and so the statement has changed. But the policy remains the same. Interest rates will stay low.</p>",Business & Finance
"Why it doesn't matter if net neutrality opponents ""won"" the FCC comment war",http://www.vox.com/2014/12/18/7417421/why-it-doesnt-matter-if-net-neutrality-opponents-won-the-fcc-comment,Comments to regulatory agencies were never intended to be a popularity contest.,"<p>The big argument in the tech policy world right now is focused on comments submitted earlier this year to the Federal Communications Commission. As Nancy Scola <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2014/12/18/dirty-data-why-the-4-million-public-comments-on-net-neutrality-might-not-be-what-they-seem/?postshare=2771418927400818"">notes</a>, President Obama recently asked the FCC to ""answer the call of almost 4 million public comments, and implement the strongest possible rules to protect net neutrality.""</p> \n<p>But it turns out that many of those comments — perhaps even a majority — were actually <em>opposed</em> to stronger network neutrality rules. A <a href=""http://sunlightfoundation.com/blog/2014/12/16/one-group-dominates-the-second-round-of-net-neutrality-comments/"">Sunlight Foundation analysis on the topic</a> has generated <a href=""http://tumblr.fightforthefuture.org/post/105452007918/fcc-and-sunlight-foundation-drastically"">angry responses</a> from left-leaning groups who say that their own submissions were under-counted. It looks like a big part of the problem is that the FCC's system for submitting comments is so old and rickety that some submitted comments didn't make it into the data set the agency released.</p> \n<p><q class=""right"" aria-hidden=""true""><span>The agency comment process was never supposed to be a popularity contest</span></q></p> \n<p>Yet it's a mistake to get too hung up on the specific numbers. The vast majority of the comments — Sunlight says 88 percent in the latest batch — were form letters created with help from a handful of activist groups on either side of the fight. So the ratio of pro- and anti-net neutrality comments may tell us less about what voters think than about how well-funded each side's activist groups are.</p> \n<p>More importantly, the agency comment process was never supposed to be a popularity contest. In most proceedings, agencies get a modest number of in-depth submissions from experts and interest groups who are expressing opinions about the nuances of proposed regulations. The ratio of comments on each side has never been an important factor in agency decision-making. One submission that raises an issue the agency hadn't considered before can be more valuable than a thousand from people who simply filled out a form on an activist group's website.</p> \n<p>Of course, the network neutrality debate has become far more political than others the FCC decides on. More ordinary people have an opinion on it than they do about almost any other issue on the FCC's docket, which is why the issue has generated millions of submissions.</p> \n<p>But that's precisely why this decision shouldn't be left to the FCC. Congress set up regulatory agencies like the FCC to work out the details of regulatory decisions. But big-picture policy decisions — especially those that are hotly contested by voters — should be made by Congress itself.</p> \n<p>Congress is specifically organized to resolve political issues like this. It has hundreds of elected officials whose job is to represent the interests of their constituents. Congress, not the FCC, should be deciding what network neutrality rules, if any, should govern the internet.</p> \n<p>Unfortunately, polarization and gridlock has made it almost impossible for Congress to do its job. Congress hasn't updated the laws governing the internet since 1996, a time before Google, Facebook, and the iPhone existed. The concept of network neutrality didn't even exist back then. Congress ought to update the law to reflect 20 years of technological change. But because it's not likely to do so, the FCC is forced to do a job it was never designed for.</p>",Business & Finance

A few reasons:</p> \n<p><strong>1) Taxes: </strong>The biggest factor is taxes — different states (and localities) <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/7/9/5883879/map-new-york-has-the-highest-gas-taxes-in-the-country-alaska-the"">tax gasoline at different rates</a>, depending on how much they want to raise for highways, roads, and bridges. (This is in addition to the 18.4-cent-per-gallon federal gas tax.) In Missouri, the gas tax is just 35.7 cents per gallon. In California, it's 68.18 cents:</p> \n<p><img alt=""Gasoline_taxes_state"" class=""photo"" src=""http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/assets/4729236/gasoline_taxes_state.png"" style=""line-height: 28.4624996185303px;""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">(American Petroleum Institute)</p> \n<p><strong>2) Environmental laws: </strong>On top of that, a few states, like California, have laws that require cleaner-burning fuels for cars — that can make gasoline even pricier.</p> \n<p><q class=""right"" aria-hidden=""true"">Gas prices are typically lower along the Gulf Coast, which is near large refineries</q></p> \n<p><strong>3) Distance to refineries: </strong>Gas prices are often lower in places like Mississippi, Alabama, Texas and Louisiana because they're close to the large refineries on the Gulf Coast — so the transportation costs of bringing gasoline to retailers is lower. By contrast, Hawaii and Alaska are far away from supply, so gas is much more expensive there.</p> \n<p><strong>4) Type of oil used: </strong>There are also more subtle factors. Refineries on the East and West coasts tend to use a more expensive type of oil — which is based on the price of Brent North Sea crude and currently trades at around $59 per barrel.</p> \n<p>Refineries in the Gulf Coast, by contrast, use more oil that's benchmarked to West Texas Intermediate, which currently trades for around $54  per barrel. The oil boom in Canada, Montana, and North Dakota, along with pipeline bottlenecks, accounts for some of that difference between Brent and WTI — although the gap <a href=""https://ycharts.com/indicators/brent_wti_spread"" target=""_blank"">is now much, much narrower</a> than it was a few years ago.</p> \n<p><span>Keep in mind things can also change over time: In the past, gas prices have spiked a bit on the East Coast when a number of large refineries had to close down for maintenance, for instance.</span></p> \n<h3>Gasoline gets cheaper in the winter, pricier in the summer</h3> \n<p>There's another twist here, too. Every year, gasoline prices rise in the summer and fall in the winter.</p> \n<p>The reason? People take more vacations when the weather's nice, which puts upward pressure on prices. But refiners also have to put out <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://auto.howstuffworks.com/fuel-efficiency/fuel-consumption/summer-fuel.htm"">a pricier ""summer blend""</a> of gasoline that's less likely to evaporate in the heat and less likely to create smog. Once the summer's over, they can switch back to the winter blend (made with cheaper ingredients like butane) and gas prices typically fall again.</p> \n<p>That all said, when the price of oil plummets, gasoline tends to be much cheaper for everyone in all seasons — even if there are variations here and there. According to the US Energy Information Administration, if oil prices stay at their current low level, the average US household <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.cfm?id=19211"">will pay about $550 less</a> for gas in 2015 than they did in 2014.</p> \n<p><span>Further reading</span></p> \n<p><a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/12/16/7401705/oil-prices-falling"" style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.65;"">Why oil prices keep falling</a> — and throwing the world into turmoil</p> \n<p>What <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/12/2/7319307/gas-prices-falling"">the huge drop in gasoline prices</a> means for America</p>",Business & Finance

The government just redefined what it means to be an employer. It's a huge deal.,http://www.vox.com/2014/12/19/7420729/nlrb-browning-ferris-employer,Workers everywhere from McDonald's to Walmart could be affected.,"<p>On Thursday, the National Labor Relations Board issued what observers are already calling its <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/28/business/labor-board-says-franchise-workers-can-bargain-with-parent-company.html"" target=""_blank"">most significant ruling in 35 years</a>. It <a href=""http://apps.nlrb.gov/link/document.aspx/09031d4581d99106"" target=""_blank"">ruled</a> that the company Browning-Ferris Industries of California is a ""joint employer"" of workers it hired through a temp agency. The company had contended that the fact that the workers were directly employed by the temp agency, a contractor, meant that it could not be considered their employer for the purpose of unionization. NLRB rejected that reasoning.</p> \n<p>Browning-Ferris is not super important as a company. But the NLRB's reasoning opens the door for labor organizing in industries that had previously been resistant. Big franchisers like McDonald's could be targeted. So could big non-unionized government contractors like Booz Allen Hamilton. It's too early to say what the ruling's precise implications will be, but if the ruling holds, they could be massive.</p> \n<h3>The Browning-Ferris decision redefines who technically ""employs"" many US workers</h3> \n<p>First, some background: <a href=""http://www.nlrb.gov/case/32-RC-109684"" target=""_blank"">waste management firm Browning-Ferris used Leadpoint</a>, a staffing agency, as a subcontractor at a California recycling plant. The Teamsters union organizing the workers argued that Browning-Ferris and Leadpoint were joint employers. Browning-Ferris disagreed, saying they were not the direct employer. The regional NLRB director sided with Browning-Ferris, ruling that its involvement in the lives of these workers was only <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/litigation/briefs/browning.html"">""routine in nature""</a> and that therefore it was not a joint employer. The national board overruled that judgment.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""center"">The Browning decision could be ""cataclysmic,"" according to one attorney</q></p> \n<p>The key question in the case was what makes an employer an employer. The current standard is that a secondary company can be judged a ""joint employer"" if it has <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://blog.ogletreedeakins.com/rare-insight-into-nlrb-gcs-thinking-on-joint-employer-standard/"">""direct and immediate impact""</a> on the worker's terms and conditions — say, if that second company is involved in hiring and determining pay levels.</p> \n<p>In an <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://mynlrb.nlrb.gov/link/document.aspx/09031d45817b1e83"">amicus brief</a>, Meghan Phillips, the counsel for the NLRB general counsel (which is something like a prosecutor's office, and operates separately from the board itself) argued that this should be changed to a much broader definition: ""if one of the entities wields sufficient influence over the working conditions of the other entity's employees such that meaningful bargaining could not occur in its absence,"" then the two entities are joint employers, she says. If you need to be at the table in a labor negotiation, then you're an employer.</p> \n<p>While Browning did not directly hire, fire, or set pay levels for the Leadpoint employees, it did determine the facility's hours and when overtime would happen, and it also ""closely monitor[ed]"" the work that was done in the plant, the <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://mynlrb.nlrb.gov/link/document.aspx/09031d45817b0be3"">AFL-CIO</a> argues in its amicus brief.</p> \n<p>""What the union says in Browning-Ferris is, 'Look, we want everybody who controls our terms and conditions of employment at the table,'"" says Craig Becker, general counsel at the AFL-CIO and a former NLRB board member.</p> \n<p>That standard could mean that many contracting companies and franchisers find themselves designated as joint employers of their contractors' and franchisees' employees.</p> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""2493524"" alt=""Walmart"" src=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2493524/156887583.0.jpg""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Could this NLRB decision change life for Walmart workers? (Getty Images)</p> \n<h3><span>That could change how corporations interact with workers</span></h3> \n<p><span>""The general counsel is trying to say that e</span><span>ven if, as employer one, I don't directly tell employees what to do, but in effect I am, through employer two, controlling employees, that makes me joint employer,"" Barbara Fick, associate professor at Notre Dame Law School and a former NLRB field attorney, told us in December.</span></p> \n<p>Now that the NLRB has agreed with that reasoning, big corporations might start to interact with their subcontractors' or franchisees' workers differently, either fully stepping in and becoming more of a hands-on employer or backing off and trying not to fall under the definition of ""joint employer.""</p> \n<p><q class=""right"" aria-hidden=""true"">labor groups argue that these sorts of working relationships lead to worse conditions and pay</q></p> \n<p><span>Businesses, of course, are worried about the repercussions of a decision. In a </span><a target=""_blank"" href=""http://apps.nlrb.gov/link/document.aspx/09031d45817a8d9e"">2014 letter</a><span> to the NLRB, the International Franchise Association writes that franchises provide ""jobs, opportunities, and extraordinarily positive economic results"" for the US, and that a decision that extends to franchises would threaten that.</span></p> \n<p>But labor (and the NLRB general counsel) argues that businesses have increasingly used contractors, temp workers, and franchises as means to escape unionization. As Philips writes in the NLRB general counsel's brief:</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p><i>Some scholars have posited that franchisors consider avoidance of unionization and the collective-bargaining process to be the ""prime advantage of franchising,"" and ""[i]n some cases, the driving force behind the conversion of fully integrated, employee-operated businesses to franchised operations is an attempt to prevent or remove the supposedly harmful effects of unionization and thereby increase profits.""</i></p> \n<p> </p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>The buffer that these sorts of relationships put between larger companies and workers, labor groups also argue, enable worse working conditions, less transparency, and lower pay.</p> \n<p>All of this could eventually trickle down to consumers. As Fisk told the <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/31/business/labor-ruling-bewilders-franchisers.html"" target=""_blank"">New York Times</a> last year, ""if labor costs for franchisees go up, then the price of a Big Mac will go up."" And it's not just labor prices that might go up — if businesses are now legally liable for what goes on at their franchises, that means insurance will cost more, which could also bump up prices for consumers.</p> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""633558"" alt=""McDonald"" src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/assets/4238183/479472975.jpg""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Workers protest at McDonald's in favor of higher wages. (Getty Images)</p> \n<h3>The ruling could impact a huge segment of the economy</h3> \n<p>It's hard to know exactly how many workers could be affected by this decision.  But it <span>could be ""cataclysmic,"" according to </span><span>Michael Lotito, cochair of the Workplace Policy Institute at Littler Mendelson</span><span>.</span></p> \n<p>""It has a way of upsetting these business relationships and employers thinking they were separate suddenly finding they are combined,"" says Lotito. ""That has just enormous implications for business relationships.""</p> \n<p><span>For example, the NLRB general counsel notes that fast-food chains often provide their franchisees with high-tech scheduling software (sometimes called ""just-in-time"" software) that uses data and algorithms to determine when workers need to come in and for how long. Though restaurants aren't directly telling workers when to work by using that software, the argument goes that it is indirectly directing scheduling by giving franchisees the software, making it a joint employer of those franchises' employees.</span></p> \n<p><span>Browning could also affect supply-chain relationships, Lotito says, as some companies create contracts with their suppliers that are restrictive enough that they wind up indirectly dictating the terms of employment at the suppliers' workplaces.</span></p> \n<p>Fick uses Walmart as a hypothetical example: ""They're so big they can pretty much control how the people they deal with make their stuff. They wield a lot of influence on the people who are actually doing the business,"" she says. Walmart's terms in its contracts with its suppliers, she says, can heavily influence pay and benefit levels.</p> \n<p>""If Walmart is saying, 'We want 20 gazillion shirts, and we're going to pay you X dollars for it,' well what's the effect of that?""</p> \n<p>At the very least, the numbers available suggest that the number of people potentially affected by this decision is growing. <span>The number of franchise employees in the US is growing at 2.3 percent per year, and is currently at around 8.5 million, according to the </span><a href=""http://franchiseeconomy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Franchise_Business_Outlook_January_2014-1-13-13.pdf"" target=""_blank"">International Franchise Association</a><span>. Not only that, but as of November, the number of employees in the temporary help industry was growing at an annual rate of </span><a href=""http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/graph/?g=V0A"" target=""_blank"">8.5 percent</a><span>.</span></p> \n<h3><span>The NLRB has leaned toward labor recently</span></h3> \n<p>The <i>Browning</i> ruling is the latest in a spate of recent NLRB decisions that have fallen in favor of labor. In 2014, the board made the union election process much <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/nlrb-issues-quickie-election-rules-28951/"">speedier</a> (opponents call the new standards the ""ambush election"" rules) and in a separate case said that employees <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://fortune.com/2014/12/11/unions-email-nlrb-ruling/"">can organize</a> on workplace email systems. In <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/22/technology/employers-social-media-policies-come-under-regulatory-scrutiny.html?pagewanted=all"">January 2013</a>, the board ruled that speech on social media is protected speech — in other words, your employer can't ban you from complaining about your working conditions on Twitter.</p> \n<p><span>These actions have angered the business community, causing </span><a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.insidecounsel.com/2014/07/01/prepare-for-nlrbs-new-joint-employer-standard-the"">some</a><span> to see the Obama-era NLRB as activist.</span></p> \n<p>However, Fick sees a different kind of coherence to these decisions. It's not so much that they're pro-labor as that they're adapting old labor rules to a new world — one in which employees have public conversations about their jobs on Twitter, and also one in which huge corporations increasingly rely on subcontracted or franchise workers.  <span>""A</span><span>s industrial relations change, we have to figure out how to apply the old rules to the new situation,"" she says.</span></p> \n<h3>The NLRB doesn't have the final word</h3> \n<p>The board's ruling won't necessarily hold. The case could still be challenged in appeals court, and the pro-business DC Circuit Court of Appeals especially has displayed a <a href=""http://www.jacksonlewis.com/resources-publication/dc-circuit-court-appeals-strikes-down-nlrb-posting-rule"" target=""_blank"">willingness to overturn NLRB judgments</a>.</p>",Business & Finance

In addition to oil and gas, one of the big things that Russia exports is grain. And, as the <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/12/16/7401401/ruble-collapse-interest-rates"">ruble gets cheaper</a> — thanks to falling oil prices — Russian grain looks more attractive to foreign buyers. That's good news for Russian farmers, but it means that the ruble-denominated price of bread in Russia is likely to rise sharply. And Vladimir Putin's administration doesn't want that to happen, so on Friday the Russian government announced that it would <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://itar-tass.com/en/economy/768430"" style=""font-size: 1.15em; line-height: 1.65; background-color: #ffffff;"">tax grain exports</a>. That keeps the domestic price relatively restrained, but it's pushing up prices globally.</p> \n<h3>Russia is big in wheat, huge in barley</h3> \n<p>Two charts from Javier Blas, an Africa editor at the Financial Times who used to run commodities coverage, show why Russian farming matters to the global economy.</p> \n<p>First, Russia is a really big exporter of wheat:</p> \n<blockquote lang=""en"" class=""twitter-tweet""> \n<p>The <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/grain?src=hash"">#grain</a> export restrictions announced by <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/Russia?src=hash"">#Russia</a> are a big deal - look at its importance in global <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/wheat?src=hash"">#wheat</a> exports <a href=""http://t.co/LkZiXYWOoD"">pic.twitter.com/LkZiXYWOoD</a></p> \n— Javier Blas (@JavierBlas2) <a href=""https://twitter.com/JavierBlas2/status/547002778695266304"">December 22, 2014</a>\n</blockquote> \n<p>Second, Russia is an absolutely gigantic exporter of barley:</p> \n<blockquote lang=""en"" data-conversation=""none"" class=""twitter-tweet""> \n<p>And even a bigger impact in <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/barley?src=hash"">#barley</a> - Russia is world's top-2 exporter. European barley prices up 25% in 3 months <a href=""http://t.co/QbZUOedTsb"">pic.twitter.com/QbZUOedTsb</a></p> \n— Javier Blas (@JavierBlas2) <a href=""https://twitter.com/JavierBlas2/status/547004312304754689"">December 22, 2014</a>\n</blockquote> \n<p>Now unless you're a huge weirdo you probably don't eat much barley, so who cares? One answer is that barley is a key ingredient in the malt used to make beer and Scotch whisky. The other is that in colder areas where you can't grow corn, barley is a widely used animal feed. So expensive barley could raise the price of meat and alcoholic beverages, even as wheat impacts food consumption more directly.</p> \n<h3>Grain price dynamics are really complicated</h3> \n<p>Higher prices for wheat, barley, and products that take barley as an input are the likely consequence of Russia's efforts to curb exports. But it should be said that linkages between the prices of global agricultural products are extremely complicated due to partial substitutability of one grain for another. Most empirical research, for example, agrees with Harry de Gorter's conclusion that growing use of biofuels has <a href=""http://appliedecon.oregonstate.edu/sites/default/files/faculty/perry/degorter.pdf"" target=""_blank"">contributed to higher rice prices</a> even though rice itself is not used to manufacture biofuels.</p> \n<p>The diversion of corn into the biofuels market and out of the animal feed market is enough to trigger a chain of events that leads to expensive rice. By the same token, the ultimate impact of reduced Russian barley exports could be felt quite remotely from the barley industry. Conversely, to the extent that cheaper oil leads to reduced biofuel use, grain prices could actually fall.</p> \n<h3>Russia's dilemma</h3> \n<p>The Russian government's inclination to reduce grain exports does tell us something pretty clear about the Russian economy. The desire to shelter ordinary Russians from higher food prices is completely understandable. But a cheaper currency leading to more robust exports is one of <i>the</i> major channels through which a country is supposed to bounce back from an adverse shock in the global economy.</p> \n<p>If the dollar value of Russian oil exports is going to fall, then Russia desperately needs exports of something else to come in and fill the gap. If that ""something else"" isn't going to be grain, then what's it going to be? The world is not exactly clamoring to get its hands on Russian manufactured goods or to sign up for <a href=""https://vk.com"" target=""_blank"">VKontakte</a> accounts. Curbing wheat exports is a fine idea if the oil price decline is just a passing storm that ends in the near future. But if oil goes into a multi-year period of relative abundance, these kind of measures will only make it harder for the Russian economy to adjust.</p>",Business & Finance
Christmas is the greatest economic stimulus,http://www.vox.com/2014/12/24/7433715/christmas-economic-miracle,Millions of jobs are created every year by the holiday. We should have a second Christmas.,"<p>Christmas is a miraculous season. In terms of cold, hard numbers — cash, jobs, and economic output — it's the happiest time of the year. A period when prosperity surges and all are filled with cheer.</p> \n<p>But this fundamental reality is typically obscured from view by a tacit conspiracy between government statisticians, academics, and financial reporters who insist on using seasonally adjusted data to wipe the Christmas Miracle off the face of the economy. This is helpful when assessing public policy, because it lets you distinguish the impact of new policy ideas from the normal ups and downs of the calendar. But the tyranny of seasonally adjusted data does obscure some things that are quite important and have potentially useful lessons for the future. If the economy can boom each year at Christmastime, why can't we keep it in a Christmas-like state all the time? As great as Christmas is, we could all be living in a richer happier country if we added a second one.</p> \n<h3>The economic miracle of Christmas</h3> \n<p>Here is a standard seasonally adjusted chart of employment growth in the United States during the years 2011, 2012, and 2013:</p> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""2870420"" alt=""seasonally_adjusted.0.png"" src=""https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2870420/seasonally_adjusted.0.png""></p> \n<p>Pretty boring stuff. But what if instead of using the standard seasonally adjusted data, I were to show you the actual data (red line)? It's much more dramatic:</p> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""2870762"" alt=""unadjusted.0.png"" src=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2870762/unadjusted.0.png""></p> \n<p>What you are seeing here is a striking fact about the economy that you never see reported in the newspaper — every January, 2 million to 3 million Americans lose their jobs. The Bureau of Labor Statistics uses its algorithmic magic to make this annual depression go away. If ""only"" 2 million people are laid off this January, the seasonally adjusted statistics — the ones reporters write up — will say there was an employment boom, with hundreds of thousands of jobs created. It then typically takes until April or May for the economy to re-obtain the level of employment it enjoyed during the previous November and December.</p> \n<p>Merry Christmas!</p> \n<h3>Gift-giving is amazing</h3> \n<p>I was raised in a Jewish household, and I'm a bit of a cold-hearted rationalist, so I am absolutely the jerk who was very impressed with Joel Waldfogel's article on the <a href=""https://www.amherst.edu/media/view/104699/original/christmas.pdf"" target=""_blank"">""Deadweight Loss of Christmas""</a> when it first came out. His idea is pretty simple. If I buy you a $100 gift and you buy me a $100 gift, the odds are very good that we will end up worse off than we would have been had we each kept our $100 and just made our own purchasing decisions. The inefficiency introduced when people try to guess what other people want is the deadweight loss of his title.</p> \n<p>Of course in the real world, nobody finds this persuasive because feelings blah blah blah.</p> \n<p>But there's no reason to be fuzzy about it. The economic data shows clearly that the seasonal surge in demand — for presents, for travel to see family, for stuff to serve at holiday parties — is an unmitigated boon for the economy. It is true that the Christmas boom entails a certain amount of waste, but waste amidst a surge of prosperity is clearly preferable to the bleak austerity of January and February.</p> \n<p>Now what is true is that this seasonal boom-and-bust cycle <a href=""http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2013/12/are-seasonal-business-cycles-inefficient.html"" target=""_blank"">is highly inefficient</a>, as George Mason University's Tyler Cowen has argued. But as the great British economist John Maynard Keynes argued decades ago, ""the right remedy from the trade cycle is not to be found in abolishing booms and thus keeping us permanently in a semi-slump; but in abolishing slumps and thus keeping us permanently in a quasi-boom."" Keynes was talking about monetary policy rather than Christmas presents, but the same principle applies. We ought to add a second Christmas sometime in the spring  to keep us permanently in a quasi-boom.</p> \n<h3>Second Christmas is affordable</h3> \n<p>The biggest skeptical reaction I get about my plan for a holiday-induced permanent boom is that people simply imagine themselves spending more cash on presents, and in exchange receiving more gifts. This conjures up a world of lower savings, higher credit card debt, and (whether they use the term or not) more deadweight loss.</p> \n<p>This reaction ignores the <i>systematic</i> impact of Christmas. Every dollar you spend is a dollar of income for someone else. This is most obvious in the case of the millions of people disemployed by the annual January bust, or for service workers who enjoy holiday tips. Those incomes, when earned, would be spent on buying goods and services from other people, increasing the overall level of prosperity.</p> \n<p>Indeed, even industries that don't exhibit an obvious seasonal character are influenced by the Economic Miracle of Christmas. Here in the Content Game, for example, we normally experience holidays as a lull in the news cycle and web readership. But advertising revenue inevitably peaks in the fourth quarter (as brands try to capture holiday shoppers' eyes) and craters in the first. A Second Christmas would stabilize ad revenue and allow higher editorial budgets all year round. Airlines and hotels would invest to add capacity to meet this higher level of year-round demand. The overall national <i>rate</i> of consumption needn't rise, just its <i>level,</i> with incomes rising in tandem.</p> \n<h3>Yes, I am serious</h3> \n<p>It's important to recognize that for tens of millions of observant Christians around the world, the day is first and foremost a religious holiday that can't be replicated. Christmas-wise, we are talking pretty strictly about the gifts-and-family aspects of the holiday, and this can all sound a bit silly. So let's return to something very serious. In November, the (seasonally adjusted) unemployment rate was 5.8 percent. Everyone can agree, I think, that if the unemployment rate were to spike to 6.3 percent that it would be a bad sign for the American economy. People would complain — loudly — that something had gone wrong. And yet the seasonal adjustment algorithm expects a 0.5 percentage points increase in the unemployment rate each and every January.</p> \n<p>The only reason people don't freak out is that the algorithm makes this rise vanish in a puff of smoke. But simply pointing at the calendar and calling it ""seasonal"" doesn't change the fact that this is a tragic loss of human potential and possible prosperity. If it were just too cold in January for people to work (or something) then we might just have to accept it as another unpleasant fact of winter. But it's not the weather that drives this seasonal downturn (it's also cold in December), it's <i>Christmas</i>. And if human ingenuity was capable of devising one economy-boosting celebration, surely we have it within us to create a second.</p>",Business & Finance

For people who consume a lot of gasoline — most of the United States, basically — the price plunge is a major boon. Estimates of the average household benefit range from <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.cfm?id=19211"">$550 per year</a> to <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/12/2/7319307/gas-prices-falling"">$1,100 per year</a> or more.

The extent of the [negative] effects depends on the prominence of oil in the state's energy mix and the lack of diversity in the state's economy.""

Assuming oil stays well below $80 per barrel, as futures markets currently predict, Brown offers some back-of-the-envelope calculations:</p> \n<blockquote style=""margin: 0 0 0 40px; border: none; padding: 0px;""> \n<p>Taking into account the income losses for US oil companies, the net gain in US income will amount to $920 per year for each household. The average propensity to consume is around 90 percent, so the average US household could spend around an additional $825 per year.</p> \n<p>Because low-income households spend a greater percentage of their income on energy consumption, and are less likely to own stocks in oil companies, such households will see larger gains and spend more. High-income households will spend less. The overall effect should amount to a one-time increase in US GDP of about 0.7-1.0 percent.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Obviously there are a lot of potential complications here. Oil prices might not stay low. The US shale boom might be more resilient (or more vulnerable) than expected. And so on. This just gives a very rough ballpark of the effect here.</p> \n<p>There's a lot more in Brown's <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.rff.org/RFF/Documents/RFF-IB-14-06.pdf"">policy brief</a>, written for Resources for the Future, about the various implications of falling oil prices — it's worth checking out.</p> \n<p><b>Further reading: </b></p> \n<p><b></b>-- Why <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/12/16/7401705/oil-prices-falling"">oil prices keep falling</a> — and throwing the world into turmoil.</p> \n<p>-- What <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/12/2/7319307/gas-prices-falling"">the huge drop</a> in gasoline prices means for America.</p> \n<p>-- My colleague Libby Nelson <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/12/11/7328019/north-dakota-fracking-money"">took a look at North Dakota's efforts</a> to prepare for the inevitable oil price crash.

Did North Korea really hack Sony?,http://www.vox.com/2014/12/23/7442763/sony-north-korea-hack,"The FBI's evidence for a North Korean connection is weak, but the US government might be holding back its strongest material.","<p>Did North Korea really hack Sony? Not everyone is convinced by the <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/12/19/7421505/fbi-north-korea-sony"" target=""_blank"">FBI's claim</a> that the country is responsible for <a href=""http://vox.com/cards/sony-hack-north-korea/"" target=""_blank"">last month's devastating cyberattack</a>on Sony Pictures. And the skeptics are right that none of the evidence the US government has released so far definitively ties the Pyongyang regime to the attacks.</p> \n<p>Yet there are still reasons to suspect that North Korea played a role in the attacks. One possibility: North Korea may have worked with an independent group to pull it off.</p> \n<p>Here's how the evidence stacks up so far.</p> \n<h3>The FBI's evidence is weak, but the US might not share its strongest evidence</h3> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""2875764"" alt=""490318647.0.jpg"" src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2875764/490318647.0.jpg""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">(KAZUHIRO NOGI/AFP/Getty Images)</p> \n<p>The FBI <a href=""http://www.fbi.gov/news/pressrel/press-releases/update-on-sony-investigation"">released a statement</a> last week blaming North Korea for the attack on Sony, and President Obama underscored the FBI's accusations at a <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/12/19/7423129/obama-says-sony-made-a-mistake-to-pull-the-interview"">Friday press conference</a>.</p> \n<p>But as a number of computer security experts have <a href=""http://blog.erratasec.com/2014/12/the-fbis-north-korea-evidence-is.html#.VJmJ1cAAA"">pointed out</a>, the FBI's evidence is far from conclusive. The agency points to two main pieces of evidence linking North Korea to the attacks:</p> \n<ul> \n<li>Malware used in the attack is similar to malware North Korea has used in previous attacks, and</li> \n<li>North Korean computers communicated with some of the same servers the Sony malware communicated with.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>But neither of these is conclusive proof of North Korea's involvement. A lot of sharing goes on in the hacking underground. It's possible that North Korea, for its earlier attacks, had simply adopted malware that was already being used by other hackers. Or maybe North Korea developed the malware, but someone else has since gotten a copy of it and customized it for their own use.</p> \n<p><q class=""right"" aria-hidden=""true"">the government may have stronger evidence than it's willing to share publicly</q></p> \n<p>A similar point applies to those shared IP addresses. One explanation for this is that North Korean hackers were using those computers for command-and-control purposes. But another possibility is that those machines provide some kind of <a href=""http://krypt3ia.wordpress.com/"">shared infrastructure</a> used by many different hackers. North Korea may have been communicating with them for reasons that have nothing to do with the Sony attacks.</p> \n<p>Maybe the FBI is presenting weak evidence because that's all it has. But another possibility is that the government has stronger evidence that it's not willing to share publicly.</p> \n<p>For example, suppose that the National Security Agency had managed to hack into North Korean systems and was able to monitor everything they did. That wouldn't be surprising — the NSA is  <a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/nsa-and-ed-snowden/does-the-nsa-engage-in-offensive-hacking-operations"">good at hacking</a> and North Korea would be one of the agency's top targets. That would help the US government to conclusively determine whether or not the North Koreans were responsible for the attack.</p> \n<p>But if the US government publicly revealed such a capability, they'd lose an extremely valuable source of information about future activities of the North Korean regime. So in this situation you'd expect the US government to do exactly what it did last week: publicly release vague and inconclusive evidence, while holding the best evidence back. That would be enough to convince most people that North Korea was responsible without damaging future intelligence operations.</p> \n<p>So, to some extent, whether you believe the US government's charges depends on how competent you think its intelligence agencies are. Hopefully, they wouldn't publicly blame the North without strong evidence, even if they couldn't share it all publicly. On the other hand, intelligence agencies have <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq_and_weapons_of_mass_destruction"">made big mistakes</a> before, so it's not surprising that people are skeptical.</p> \n<h3>The hackers haven't acted like a normal nation-state, but North Korea isn't a normal nation-state</h3> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2875780/175467745.0.jpg"" alt=""175467745.0.jpg"" data-chorus-asset-id=""2875780""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">(Ed Jones/AFP/Getty Images)</p> \n<p>Wired's Kim Zetter, a leading skeptic of the ""blame North Korea"" position, <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.wired.com/2014/12/evidence-of-north-korea-hack-is-thin/"">argues</a> that ""nation-state attacks aren’t generally as noisy, or announce themselves with an image of a blazing skeleton posted to infected computers, as occurred in the Sony hack."" This is true. Governments generally have specific goals — interfering with Iran's nuclear program, say, or gathering intelligence — that are easiest to achieve if the targets don't know they're being attacked. So they generally try to fly below the radar for as long as possible. And the tone of the hackers' messages and postings did not exactly scream ""highly professionalized government operation.""</p> \n<p>The problem with this argument is that there's nothing normal about North Korea. The country has repeatedly <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/12/19/7421535/the-real-reason-north-korea-would-hack-sony-its-not-the-interview"">gone out of its way</a> to antagonize other countries. It has test-fired missiles over Japan, shelled a South Korean island, and probably sank the South Korean naval ship <em>Cheonan</em>. North Korea denied responsibility for the <em>Cheonan</em> attack just as it has denied responsibility for hacking Sony, but few people believed the denials.</p> \n<p><q class=""right"" aria-hidden=""true""><span>The answer to the question ""did North Korea do it"" might turn out to be ""it's complicated""</span></q></p> \n<p><span>North Korea isn't like other countries. It has different goals and pursues them in different ways than almost any other country on the planet. So it wouldn't be surprising if they carried out their attacks in different ways than other countries have.</span></p> \n<p>And there's one big reason to think North Korea played some role in the attacks. If they didn't, then why were the hackers so obsessed with getting Sony to shelve <em>The Interview?</em> The hackers' campaign against the movie included a <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/12/16/7403437/sony-hacks-threats"">thinly veiled threat</a> to blow up movie theaters that showed it. Then, after Sony announced they'd be canceling the scheduled December 25 release of The Interview, the hackers reportedly <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/12/19/7422261/hackers-warn-sony-not-to-make-further-trouble"">emailed Sony executives</a> and told them that the leaks would stop unless Sony causes ""additional trouble"" by releasing the movie in the future.</p> \n<p>While plenty of people think the movie is in bad taste, it's hard to imagine anyone outside of Pyongyang being so angry about the film that they'd launch a major cyberattack to stop its release.</p> \n<h3>Did North Korea have outside help?</h3> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2875840/162913476.0.jpg"" alt=""162913476.0.jpg"" data-chorus-asset-id=""2875840""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">(AFP)</p> \n<p>Of course, critics of the North Korea theory have pointed out that the hackers' focus on <em>The Interview</em> didn't start until a week after hackers went public in late November.</p> \n<p>One possible explanation is that North Korea only got involved in the attacks after the initial attack. Perhaps someone totally unconnected to Pyongyang compromised Sony's network and then sold control and data to the North Korean government. Or perhaps the attack was carried out by a hacker group that sometimes does work for the North Korean government, but North Korea only became directly involved after the initial announcement. That would explain why they seemed to use some of the same tools and infrastructure.</p> \n<p>This would also help to explain the skillful way the hackers manipulated the media into embarrassing Sony, increasing hackers' leverage in the process. As Vox's Todd VanDerWerff has <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/12/22/7433243/sony-hack-gossip-information"">written</a>, the attackers doled out leaked documents in batches to strategically-chosen journalists, making it more likely that reporters from various media outlets would comb through the files looking for scoops.</p> \n<p>That ensured that the media would publish a lot of damaging scoops about the company before the hackers pivoted to its Interview-related demands. Todd notes that if the hackers had focused on <em>The Interview</em> from the outset, media organizations would have been squeamish about participating in what amounted to a blackmail campaign against Sony.</p> \n<p>It's hard to imagine that North Korea, working alone, would have had sufficient understanding of American media habits and organizations to pull this off. But if North Korea were working with an outside group with ties to the West, they could outsource the details of the media campaign to them.</p> \n<p>Ultimately, there might not even be a clear line between a North Korean operation and an independent one. In the internet's shadowy underworld, hackers can be affiliated with multiple groups, and groups can do work for multiple customers. Hackers often share code and computing resources with each other without knowing exactly how they'll be used.  So the answer to the question ""did North Korea do it"" might turn out to be ""it's complicated.""</p>",Business & Finance

You may have been getting a raise for years. It's just not going to your bank account.,http://www.vox.com/2014/12/27/7449275/stagnant-wages-expensive-benefits,Employers have been spending more and more on workers...but it's not going to wages and salaries.,"<p>Everyone knows <a href=""http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/10/09/for-most-workers-real-wages-have-barely-budged-for-decades/"" target=""_blank"">wages are stagnant</a>. That's been one of the dominant (and most frustrating) economic stories of recent years. And now as the job market is limping its way back to health, we're all waiting for wages to pick up, which should be a sign that labor market slack is tightening.</p> \n<p>But many workers really have been getting more from their bosses without realizing it. Data released <a href=""http://www.bls.gov/ncs/ect/sp/ececqrtn.pdf"" target=""_blank"">earlier this month</a> from the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that while wages have been flat, benefits have grown quickly over the last decade.</p> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""2882894"" alt=""Wages benefits"" src=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2882894/Screen_Shot_2014-12-26_at_10.25.57_AM.0.png""></p> \n<p>Over the last 10 years, employer spending on inflation-adjusted wages and salaries has held steady, slipping slightly from $22.45 per hour in 2004 to $22.13 in 2014.

But wages and salaries as a percentage of the total compensation that employees earn has slowly slid as benefits have taken up a bigger and bigger share. Today, wages and salaries make up 68.7 percent of workers' total compensation, compared to 70.8 a decade ago, as benefits have taken up an ever-growing share.</p> \n<p>Of course, it's not that employers are deciding to buy more or better plans for their workers.

Driving in the US has been declining for years. Will cheap gas change that?,http://www.vox.com/2014/12/27/7451011/gas-prices-driving,Maybe not.

So forecasters don't expect a surge of driving in 2015, even if gas prices stay low.</p> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2882856/main__3_.0.png"" alt=""main__3_.0.png"" data-chorus-asset-id=""2882856""></p> \n<p style=""text-align: start;"" class=""caption"">(Energy Information Administration)</p> \n<h3>Demand for gasoline in the US is inelastic — for now</h3> \n<p><span>One key concept here is </span><span><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_elasticity_of_demand"" target=""_blank"">price elasticity</a><i> </i></span><span>— how much the demand for gasoline changes in response to changes in price. The EIA estimates that, in the very short run, Americans' demand for gasoline is fairly inelastic. The price of gas would have to fall 25 to 50 percent for US driving to rise by just 1 percent. (That is, the elasticity is -0.02 to -0.04.) </span></p> \n<p><q class=""right"" aria-hidden=""true"">In many cities, there aren't good alternatives to cars</q></p> \n<p>This makes some intuitive sense.

Only <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2012/07/11/why-most-americans-cant-take-mass-transit-to-work/"" target=""_blank"">about one-quarter of jobs</a> in the 100 biggest US metropolitan areas are easily accessible to their workers by public transit, for example.</p> \n<p>So people have to make these trips. And when gas prices rise, Americans keep driving in the short term — though they do often go out and buy <a href=""https://blog.gasbuddy.com/posts/Americans-buy-fuel-efficient-cars-when-prices-rise-then-go-backwards-when-prices-fall-study/1715-499732-1076.aspx"" target=""_blank"">smaller, more fuel-efficient cars</a>. By the same token, when prices fall, driving habits don't change immediately. People just have extra money in their pockets all of the sudden. (Spending on gasoline makes up <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.cfm?id=19211"">around 5 percent</a> of US household budgets.)</p> \n<p>Either way, it takes a really big swing in prices to change driving habits in the short term.</p> \n<h3>And US driving has been in long-term decline</h3> \n<p>On top of that, overall driving in the United States has been declining steadily since 2005 <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/04/22/why-arent-younger-americans-driving-anymore/"" target=""_blank"">for a variety of structural reasons</a> that won't all go away just because gas is getting cheaper:</p> \n<p><img style=""line-height: 28.4624996185303px;"" data-chorus-asset-id=""2883712"" alt=""Vehicle_Miles_Traveled_3.0.png"" src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2883712/Vehicle_Miles_Traveled_3.0.png""></p> \n<p>Driving is on the downswing <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/04/22/why-arent-younger-americans-driving-anymore/"" target=""_blank"">for a few reasons</a>: <b>1)</b> The US population is getting older, and retirees tend to drive less. <b>2)</b> More and more young people are moving to cities, where there are better transit options. <b>3)</b> It's become much harder for teenagers to acquire drivers' licenses. <b>4)</b> Young people may be driving less for cultural reasons (possibly they prefer to hang out with their friends on Facebook than piling into a car and driving around aimlessly).</p> \n<p>That may explain why American driving habits today seem to be less responsive to changes in gas prices than they were in the 1990s. Back then, the EIA estimates, it only took a 12 percent drop in gas prices to boost driving by 1 percent (elasticity was -0.08). Nowadays it takes a 25 to 50 percent drop.</p> \n<p>(Note that these numbers <i>only </i>apply to driving. Air travel, by contrast, is much more sensitive to changes in price — which, again, makes sense, since a bigger fraction of air travel is for vacation and relatively optional. According to the EIA's figures, a 10 percent increase in plane ticket prices causes air travel to fall by more than 10 percent.)</p> \n<h3>But will driving habits change in the long term?</h3> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2883740/97962867__1_.0.0.0.jpg"" alt=""97962867__1_.0.0.0.jpg"" data-chorus-asset-id=""2883740""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">(Miguel Villagran/Getty Images)</p> \n<p><span>So what does that mean for next year? </span>EIA currently projects US gasoline prices to be 23 percent lower in 2015. If that pans out — and assuming that the agency's elasticity numbers are correct — US driving would only rise by around 1 percent or less.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""right"">It's harder to predict the impact of low oil prices on driving in China and India</q></p> \n<p>At the same time, US cars and light trucks are getting steadily more efficient thanks to <a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/obama-climate-plan/what-are-u-s-fuel-efficiency-standards-for-cars-and-trucks#E7083348"" target=""_blank"">nationwide fuel-economy standards</a> that are ratcheting up. Add those together, and the EIA doesn't expect overall US gasoline consumption to change much in 2015 (compared with 2014).</p> \n<p>Given that transportation accounts for <a href=""http://www.epa.gov/otaq/climate/documents/420f13033a.pdf"" target=""_blank"">about 28 percent</a> of US greenhouse-gas emissions, that's a relief for those worried about global warming. Instead, the main impact will be economic — the average US household <a href=""http://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.cfm?id=19211"" target=""_blank"">is expected to save about $550</a> on gasoline next year (assuming oil prices stay low).</p> \n<p>But there's a caveat here: This is only a projection for 2015. If gasoline stays cheap for a long time — several years or a decade — then the price elasticity could change in the future and driving habits could start to shift more dramatically. Maybe more people will decide to move to the suburbs, say. Or more young people will decide to start driving again. The future, as always, is hard to predict.</p> \n<h3>And what about China and India?</h3> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2883742/15128094290_1552547b11_o__1_.0.jpg"" alt=""15128094290_1552547b11_o__1_.0.jpg"" data-chorus-asset-id=""2883742""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Beijing Traffic, evening rush hour.

And many Lyft drivers don't make much more than minimum wage.,"<p>Last month, I <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/12/17/7402311/lyft-driver-pay"">spent a week</a> working as a Lyft driver. Here are 5 things that surprised me about the experience.</p> \n<h3>1) In DC, many Lyft drivers don't make much more than minimum wage</h3> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""2882914"" alt=""lyft_pic3.0.0.0.jpg"" src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2882914/lyft_pic3.0.0.0.jpg""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Me, driving for Lyft.</p> \n<p>I got lucky. I drove at a time when Lyft was guaranteeing new drivers that they'd make at least $30 per hour if they drove 50 hours in one week. But if that guarantee wasn't in effect, I <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/12/17/7402311/lyft-driver-pay"">would have made less than $12 an hour</a>. Once you factor in gas and other expenses, my earnings would have been around Washington DC's minimum wage, $9.50 per hour.</p> \n<p>My low earnings were partly due to my own inexperience. But my reporting suggests that — at least in the Washington DC area — my earnings weren't too far out of the ordinary. Drivers told me they made $12 to $15 per hour — and more like $9 to $12 per hour once you factor expenses in.</p> \n<p>Driving for Lyft is great if you care a lot about flexibility. But it's not a way to make a lot of money.</p> \n<h3>2) Real Lyft customers ride in the front</h3> \n<div class=""align-right""> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""2882922"" alt=""Liz-Temkin-SoCal-e1406654221853.0.jpg"" src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2882922/Liz-Temkin-SoCal-e1406654221853.0.jpg""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">(Lyft)</p> \n</div> \n<p>Before I spent a week as a Lyft driver, I'd never given much thought to the difference between the different ride-sharing companies. Uber and Lyft seemed as different to me as Coke and Pepsi. But some of the Lyft regulars I met had strong feelings about the companies — and the differences between them.</p> \n<p>It was easy to figure out who the committed Lyfters were because they sat in the front without me suggesting it. Some told me they didn't like the way Uber passengers, like traditional taxicab passengers, sit in the back. They preferred Lyft's egalitarian vibe.</p> \n<p>Many Lyft regulars were also turned off by what they saw as the arrogant attitude of Uber management. Some cited a recent controversy over Uber's recruitment practices: Uber representatives had hailed Lyft drivers in order to pitch them on switching to Uber, which rubbed many people the wrong way. (For what it's worth, this <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/8/27/6074919/the-uber-recruitment-scandal-isnt-scandalous"">didn't seem like much of a scandal</a> to me.)</p> \n<h3>3) Lyft riders hate Uber's surge pricing</h3> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2883104/surge_pricing.0.png"" alt=""surge_pricing.0.png"" data-chorus-asset-id=""2883104""></p> \n<p>The thing Lyft customers seem to hate the most about Uber is surge pricing. That's when Uber automatically raises prices during periods of high demand.</p> \n<p>People have been complaining about surge pricing for as long as Uber has used it. Still, talking to a bunch of Lyft customers helped me appreciate how strong anti-surge-pricing feelings are. My passengers mentioned it more than any other Uber complaint, when I asked them about the two companies.</p> \n<p>That's a bit surprising because Lyft actually does something similar. But Lyft's version of surge pricing, known as prime-time bonuses, seems designed to enrage customers less. Uber has been known to jack up the price of a ride as much as eightfold. In contrast, Lyft almost never raises prices by more than 200 percent. And customers told me that they see elevated prices less frequently on Lyft than on Uber.</p> \n<p>The economic argument for surge pricing is impeccable: varying prices helps to balance supply and demand, ensuring that people who really need a ride can always get one. But businesses have to take customer preferences into account whether or not they're rational. So it might make sense for Uber to adopt Lyft's softer approach to demand-based pricing.</p> \n<h3>4) Some parts of Lyft are surprisingly low-tech</h3> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2883106/174293520.0.jpg"" alt=""174293520.0.jpg"" data-chorus-asset-id=""2883106""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">(Essdras M Suarez/The Boston Globe)</p> \n<p>To become a Lyft driver, you have to fill out an application using the Lyft app. Then, within a matter of hours, the app connected me with a ""mentor"" — an experienced Lyft driver who checked out my vehicle and answered my questions. These early steps were so streamlined that I expected the rest of the process to go smoothly too.</p> \n<p>But that's not how it turned out. A week after I submitted my application, I got an email asking me to drop by Lyft's DC office to complete my application. I thought I already <em>had</em> completed my application, so I ignored the email. Then I got another email the next week.</p> \n<p>Lyft's DC office consisted of a couple of guys at a co-working office. One of them figured out the problem with my application: because I had lived in DC less than a year, I needed to submit my driver's license number from Pennsylvania, where I had lived previously. But the Lyft app hadn't asked me for that information originally, and there was no way to submit it electronically. I had to visit the office a second time with my Pennsylvania license in hand.</p> \n<p>In short, behind the scenes, Lyft looks a lot like any other bureaucratic company with confusing processes.</p> \n<h3>5) The Lyft app has some frustrating bugs</h3> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2883122/Lyft_Illustration1.0.0.png"" alt=""Lyft_Illustration1.0.0.png"" data-chorus-asset-id=""2883122""></p> \n<p>Lyft offers a ""power driver bonus"" that pays drivers up to 25 percent extra if you drive at least 50 hours/week. But to qualify for this bonus (or the $30/hour guarantee in effect at the time I drove), drivers must accept at least 90 percent of the hails they receive.</p> \n<p>That turned out to be stressful, because sometimes I'd miss hails due to no fault of my own. On three separate occasions, I'd pull out my smartphone and have the Lyft app scold me for failing to accept a ride request. It advised me to turn the app off if I wasn't available to pick up passengers. But I <em>was</em> available to pick up passengers and I had my phone with me the whole time. It just didn't make any noise.</p> \n<p>This bug was stressful because I didn't have a very big margin for error. I would only have 54 passengers, so I couldn't afford to miss more than 5 hails. And in practice, this meant I couldn't deliberately decline any hails because I couldn't predict how often the app would malfunction later in the week.</p> \n<p>In the end, everything worked out. I ""missed"" three hails for a total acceptance rate of 95 percent. But for much of the week, I worried that connectivity problems would push me below 90 percent.</p> \n<p>Another annoying bug: at the end of a ride, the driver is supposed to tap the ""drop-off"" button to indicate that the ride is completed. A couple of times I forgot to do this until later. But the Lyft app doesn't have any way for the driver to report this kind of mistake. I was forced to just tap the drop-off button late, generating a $44 bill for a ride that should have cost about $7.</p> \n<p>Eventually, I got this charge corrected by emailing Lyft customer support. But in the process, it created needless confusion for the customer, who thought she was going to get charged the full $44.</p> \n<p><b>Update:</b> Shortly after writing that Lyft never raises prices by more than a factor of two, I saw that Lyft had temporarily increased the maximum prime time rate to 400 percent (meaning passengers can pay up to five times the normal rate) for New Year's Eve. I've updated the article accordingly.</p> \n<h3><a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/12/17/7402311/lyft-driver-pay"">Read more about my week on Lyft here</a></h3> \n<p><!-- CHORUS_VIDEO_EMBED ChorusVideo:61504 --></p>",Business & Finance

The <a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/fracking"" target=""_blank"">US fracking boom</a> has created a glut of cheap natural gas — and New England has been using more and more gas for electricity in recent years, per <a href=""http://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.cfm?id=12851"" target=""_blank"">the Energy Information Administration</a>:</p> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""2889148"" alt=""natgas.0.png"" src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2889148/natgas.0.png""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">(<a href=""http://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.cfm?id=12851"" target=""_blank"">Energy Information Administration</a>)</p> \n<p>That posed a problem for Entergy.

Companies will have to build new pipelines to accommodate higher gas demand.

One problem? Natural gas prices have a tendency to spike in New England during the winter, leading to higher electricity bills.</p> \n<p>Another complication: Natural gas is still a fossil fuel — and produces carbon-dioxide emissions when burned (less than coal, but more than nuclear). And Vermont has set a goal of <a href=""http://www.burlingtonfreepress.com/story/news/local/vermont/2014/12/18/officials-consider-vermont-yankee-replacement/20596573/"" target=""_blank"">getting just 10 percent</a> of its energy from fossil fuels by 2050 to help address climate change. Replacing a nuclear plant isn't always so easy.</p> \n<h3>Dismantling a nuclear plant is a complicated process</h3> \n<p>In the meantime, Vermont has to deal with the shuttered plant. Vermont Yankee employed about 600 people, and <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/dec/29/vermont-shutters-nuclear-power-plant-yankee"" target=""_blank"">half of that workforce will be cut</a> starting on January 19, 2015.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""right"">Dismantling the plant will cost $1.24 billion and has to wait until the 2030s or 2040s</q></p> \n<p>Entergy, for its part, is turning in its operating license and beginning the long, slow process of decommissioning the plant. That means <a href=""http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21328551.400-how-to-dismantle-a-nuclear-reactor.html?"" target=""_blank"">dealing with tons of radioactive material</a>: not just the plant's spent fuel rods, but also various materials that have picked up lower levels of radioactivity — including, potentially, the reactor vessel, the fuel-rod casings, various bits of scrap metal and even old clothing. That waste can’t just be dumped in regular landfills; it all needs to be disposed of properly. (<a href=""http://www.newscientist.com/data/images/archive/2855/28551401.jpg"">Here’s</a> a graphic breaking down the various types of waste.)</p> \n<p>Decommissioning Vermont Yankee <a href=""http://www.pressherald.com/2014/10/17/vermont-yankee-to-cost-1-24-billion/"" target=""_blank"">is expected to cost some $1.24 billion</a> in all, though it won't happen immediately.

(New reactors are mainly being built in regulated states where utilities can recover their costs through rate hikes.) Some operators have gotten permission to ramp up the amount of electricity their nuclear plants produce — <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2012/07/18/how-to-increase-nuclear-power-without-attracting-attention/"">known as ""uprating""</a> — but, for the most part, the economics have become tough.</p> \n<p>And that's potentially bad news for climate change. Some of the shuttered reactors are being replaced, at least in part, by natural gas. If even more nuclear reactors have to close in the years ahead, it will be far more difficult for the US to <a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/obama-climate-plan/why-have-u-s-carbon-dioxide-emissions-fallen-since-2005"">keep cutting its carbon-dioxide emissions</a>. A separate <a href=""http://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.cfm?id=16031"">recent report</a> by the EIA found that US emissions could rise an additional 4 percent in the years ahead if existing reactors continued to face tailwinds:</p> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""2889204"" alt=""lower_coal_scenarios_2.0.png"" src=""https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2889204/lower_coal_scenarios_2.0.png""></p> \n<p>In his paper, Vine notes that the electricity that comes from all of the nation's existing nuclear reactors is currently undervalued — it's a large source of carbon-free electricity, but that doesn't count when it has to go up against cheaper fossil fuels like natural gas. A carbon tax or price on carbon, which <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/05/23/seven-thrilling-facts-about-carbon-taxes-from-the-cbo/"">many economists recommend</a> as a way to deal with climate change, would put many of these plants on a firmer footing.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""right"">A carbon price might slow the closure of existing nuclear plants</q></p> \n<p>A carbon price wouldn't necessarily make it more economical to build <em>new </em>nuclear power plants.

"The dark web: what it is, how it works, and why it's not going away",http://www.vox.com/2014/12/31/7470965/dark-web-explained,The internet's underworld allows people to buy drugs and download child pornography.,"<p>2014 saw the continued growth of the dark web, a collection of underground websites that allow people to engage in often-illegal activities beyond the reach of law enforcement. Here's what the dark web is, how it works, and why it's not going away any time soon.</p> \n<h3>What is the dark web?</h3> \n<p>T<span>he dark web is a general term for the seedier corners of the web, where people can interact online without worrying about the watchful eye of the authorities. Usually, these sites are guarded by encryption mechanisms such as Tor that allow users to visit them anonymously. But there are also sites that don't rely on Tor, such as password-protected forums where hackers trade secrets and stolen credit card numbers, that can also be considered part of the dark web.</span></p> \n<p>People use the dark web for a variety of purposes: buying and selling drugs, discussing hacking techniques and selling hacking services, trading child pornography, and so forth.</p> \n<p>It's important to remember that the technologies used to facilitate ""dark web"" activities aren't inherently good or bad. The same technologies used by drug dealers and child pornographers to hide their identity can also be used by whistleblowers and dissidents in repressive regimes.</p> \n<h3>What's Tor? Why is it important for the dark web?</h3> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2890218/onion.0.png"" alt=""onion.0.png"" data-chorus-asset-id=""2890218""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">(<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/monojussi/4983200776/in/photolist-nTxKR-e3Jjtq-qKiHT-87KL94-2tqGQG-dTnYK1-7JSZ8o-8AmcYL-8Mtxfc-pWmE2D-dNwEhv-oED8SW-6bwDM6-c9LoJw-c9LoEh-7ApLoP-86S7E7-7Hq5bs-emuF9R-c4TbVq-8FZ3Q6-4Xku5L-6Qzym5-eMMUzo-57D9Vp-9EW4Zb-sRwPa-5b5YFE-9AstBy-9aLNZM-eanGo8-nFK18p-4eNvK-eaQrU6-e5RVdy-m6g2Ei-oJ2TSd-6u7Q9U-6WJSLw-8fpy78-dNV1Dh-8mx9UY-pkp5N2-fNNpMv-8f8D2r-9aqMdY-o5qNDw-5V7bxW-gSWq61-eH2v"">Jussi Mononen</a>)</p> \n<p>Tor, which stands for ""the onion router,"" is a technology that allows people to browse the web and access online services without revealing their identities. The Tor network consists of thousands of servers located all over the world. They're run by volunteers seeking to bolster privacy rights.</p> \n<p>When you browse the web using a <a href=""https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en"" target=""_blank"">Tor-based browser</a>, your communications are automatically bounced off of several Tor servers before they reach their destination. The process makes it almost impossible for anyone to trace the traffic back to you. According to documents released by Ed Snowden, <a href=""http://www.theverge.com/2014/12/28/7458159/encryption-standards-the-nsa-cant-crack-pgp-tor-otr-snowden"">even the NSA</a> has struggled to unmask Tor users.</p> \n<p>Tor allows the creation of hidden services, websites that use the Tor network to hide their physical location. This technology has allowed the creation of  websites devoted to illegal activities that are difficult for the authorities to trace and shut down.</p> \n<p>Surprisingly, Tor was created with financial support from the US government, which wanted to promote the free flow of information. Government support for Tor <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2013/10/05/the-nsa-is-trying-to-crack-tor-the-state-department-is-helping-pay-for-it/"">has continued</a> in recent years as part of the State Department's internet freedom agenda, which seeks to help people in repressive regimes gain access to information censored by their governments.</p> \n<p>While Tor has many illicit uses, it also has a lot of legitimate ones. For example, Facebook <a href=""http://www.wired.com/2014/10/facebook-tor-dark-site/"">recently announced</a> a version of its website that can be accessed over the Tor network, which will make it easier to access the site from countries that restrict the service, such as China and Iran.</p> \n<h3>What kind of information can you find on the dark web?</h3> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2890234/2941549171_684d1f55ed_b.0.jpg"" alt=""2941549171_684d1f55ed_b.0.jpg"" data-chorus-asset-id=""2890234""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">(<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/photophilde/2941549171"">photophilde</a>)</p> \n<p>Almost any type of illegal and legally questionable products and services can be found somewhere in the internet's underground.</p> \n<p>One of the best examples is the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silk_Road_(marketplace)"">Silk Road</a>, a now-defunct website that, for more than two years, operated as a kind of illicit eBay. The Silk Road was most famous for offering a wide variety of illegal drugs, but it offered other illicit products as well. You could buy fake IDs, pirated DVDs, fireworks, and stolen credit-card numbers.</p> \n<p>The Silk Road website was a Tor hidden service, which made it difficult for the authorities to shut the site down. All transactions were conducted using <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/bitcoin/what-is-bitcoin"">Bitcoin</a>, meaning they couldn't be traced the way credit-card transactions can be. But eventually, law enforcement was able to identify the site's alleged operator, who was <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2013/10/02/feds-arrest-the-alleged-founder-of-bitcoins-largest-drug-market/"">arrested</a> in 2013.</p> \n<p>Almost immediately, copycat sites <a href=""http://arstechnica.com/business/2013/11/just-a-month-after-shutdown-silk-road-2-0-emerges/"">sprang up</a>. A successor site called Silk Road 2 was founded in 2013, but it was infiltrated by law enforcement and <a href=""http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2014/11/fbi-arrests-blake-defcon-benthall-alleged-operator-of-silk-road-2-0/"">shut down</a> in 2014. Currently, one of the largest Silk Road successors is a site called Evolution. Ars Technica recently <a href=""http://arstechnica.com/business/2014/12/after-two-silk-road-takedowns-dark-web-drug-sites-still-thriving/"">reported</a> that it had 26,000 product listings.</p> \n<p>Even these sites had some lines they weren't willing to cross. For example, all three sites barred child pornography listings. But other dark web sites exist to help users find and distribute this kind of material. A recent study by computer scientist Gareth Owen suggested that sites related to child abuse and child pornography could account for as much as <a href=""http://www.wired.com/2014/12/80-percent-dark-web-visits-relate-pedophilia-study-finds/"">80 percent of traffic</a> to Tor hidden services (though hidden services account for a small fraction of Tor traffic overall).</p> \n<h3>Why has Bitcoin become popular on dark web sites?</h3> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2890244/10867282386_0cb2dbbc84_k__2_.0.jpg"" alt=""10867282386_0cb2dbbc84_k__2_.0.jpg"" data-chorus-asset-id=""2890244""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">(<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/105644709@N08/10867282386/in/photolist-e9LG7B-c7TeVY-e9SmUj-a1DE33-mqZ21z-frS34B-hCJgPw-e9SmRY-e9LGa4-ekuPT3-pZdEC7-gGGQdP-i2xJE1-dPcqJ1-hyiErG-i2yuN8-gGQr2d-gGQRbT-fs7uhY-hBKvvp-djtQAv-gGQUSJ-idijdK-it3guk-j1XXSa-gGmEFd-gGQNJb-gGHFex-gGQDZA-gGQFTe-gGQT8b-hgM7NV-fNpNJY-gGPxXE-hgLc1q-mw6pcM-gGQmUe-gGQiTV-hgL66m-fD4SZs-hgM48i-hgL6pL-mryNFK-gGQLQD-hWQeQb-gGQU3V-gaRCV5-gGQPhA-nTZFTr-gAtcyN"">Antana</a>)</p> \n<p>If you tried to set up an illicit drug marketplace that used conventional credit cards, it wouldn't last very long. For one thing, Visa and Mastercard rules would likely bar you from getting a merchant account. And customers would be wary of using a credit card linked to their real identity to make illicit purchases. You'd also have to worry about customers reversing charges after the goods had been delivered, since you can't exactly go to the authorities if your customers rip you off.</p> \n<p>In short, a digital black market needs the digital equivalent of cash. And that's exactly what Bitcoin is. Bitcoin, like cash, allows transactions to be made anonymously. And with no one in charge of the Bitcoin network, there's no one with the authority to block illicit transactions.</p> \n<p>But we shouldn't overstate Bitcoin's anonymity. You don't need to prove your identity before using the Bitcoin network the way you do with credit cards. But that doesn't necessarily mean the authorities won't be able to trace buyers and sellers. Indeed, information about every Bitcoin transaction is publicly available; by examining the pattern of transactions, the authorities may be able to tie a Bitcoin transaction to a real-world identity.</p> \n<p>For example, the authorities were allegedly able to prove that the founder of Silk Road 2 <a href=""http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2014/11/silk-road-2-0-infiltrated-from-the-start-sold-8m-per-month-in-drugs/"">cashed out $273,626.60 worth of bitcoins</a>, then used some of the cash to buy a brand new Tesla Model S. We don't know exactly how the authorities made this connection, but they may have subpoenaed the exchange that converted the bitcoins into dollars. Disguising bitcoin earnings is a complex and difficult task; one slip-up can reveal your real identity.</p> \n<p>As with Tor, it's important to note that not all, or even most, uses of the Bitcoin network are for illicit purposes. There are <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://techcrunch.com/2014/08/13/fresh-off-of-raising-30m-bitpay-staffs-up-in-san-francisco-with-visa-paypal-alums/"">tens of thousands of legitimate businesses</a> that accept Bitcoin. But criminals have been attracted to Bitcoin for the same reasons they've been attracted to conventional cash.</p> \n<h3>Is the dark web the same thing as the deep web?</h3> \n<p>No, the deep web is a broader concept. It refers to all online content that's not accessible to search engines. That includes the internet's underground economy, but it also includes mainstream websites that simply aren't set up for Google's and Bing's web crawlers. For example, most of Facebook is part of the deep web: most Facebook content is only available to the poster's friends, not the general public. Similarly, many searchable databases won't come up in Google results even though anyone can access them.</p> \n<h3>Can the authorities ever stamp out the dark web?</h3> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2890232/15591146326_e07f289d18_o.0.jpg"" alt=""15591146326_e07f289d18_o.0.jpg"" data-chorus-asset-id=""2890232""></p> \n<p class=""caption"" style=""text-align: start;"">(<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/99370417@N08/15591146326"">Daniel 'Bucko' Buxton</a>)</p> \n<p>The government is unlikely to ever fully suppress the dark web for the same reason that law enforcement has never been able to eliminate conventional black markets: there's a lot of demand for the information and products offered on these sites, and there's always going to be someone willing to take the risks involved in meeting that demand.</p> \n<p>And these sites can earn a lot of money. Silk Road 2, for example, reportedly <a href=""http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2014/11/silk-road-2-0-infiltrated-from-the-start-sold-8m-per-month-in-drugs/"">earned $8 million</a> in a single month before it was shut down. That kind of money will always attract copycats who believe they can succeed where their predecessors had failed.</p> \n<p>Moreover, the government probably can't — and shouldn't — shut down the underlying technologies that make the dark web possible. Tor provides crucial protection to dissidents and whistleblowers around the world. Bitcoin has the potential to <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/3/31/5557170/bitcoin-bad-currency-good-network"">produce significant innovations</a> in the payments business. And shutting down these technologies won't stop people from using the internet for illicit purposes. Most likely, these activities will simply shift overseas, where they will be even harder for American authorities to police.</p>",Business & Finance

Software patents are a disaster. The courts finally did something about it in 2014.,http://www.vox.com/2014/12/31/7475317/software-patents-2014-review,A landmark Supreme Court ruling could mark the beginning of the end for patenting software.,"<p>For two decades, people in Silicon Valley have been <a href=""http://progfree.org/Patents/testimony/statements/oracle.statement.html"">complaining about software patents</a>. People would get patents on broad concepts like <a href=""http://arstechnica.com/uncategorized/2006/03/6314-2/"">checking email wirelessly</a> or <a href=""http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2014/01/notorious-scan-to-email-patents-go-big-sue-coca-cola-and-dillards/"">scanning documents to an email account</a>, and then sue anyone who happened to stumble across the same concept. Thanks to this kind of frivolous  litigation, patents in the software industry may actually be <a href=""http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2012/07/new-study-same-authors-patent-trolls-cost-economy-29-billion-yearly/"">discouraging innovation</a> instead of encouraging it.</p> \n<p>But until recently, complaints about excessive patenting of software mostly fell on deaf ears. The patent office issued tens of thousands of new software patents every year, and the courts upheld most of them. Congress showed little interest in addressing the issue.</p> \n<p>But in June 2014, everything changed. A <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/6/19/5824130/7-thoughts-on-the-supreme-courts-software-patent-ruling"">landmark Supreme Court ruling</a> placed stricter limits on software patents for the first time in more than 30 years. Lower courts followed suit, nixing <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/11/17/7222807/software-patent-invalid-record"">at least 17 software patents</a> in the second half of 2014. And the patent office has begun to look at patents on software with a more skeptical eye.</p> \n<p>There's likely to be more good news ahead for software patent skeptics. This year's court rulings are a reflection of growing public concern about excessive patenting in the software industry. That skepticism is likely to drive further restrictions in the years ahead.</p> \n<h3>Software patents: an experiment gone bad</h3> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""2893580"" alt=""98476687.0.jpg"" src=""https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2893580/98476687.0.jpg""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Justice Clarence Thomas wrote the <i>CLS v. Alice</i> decision for a unanimous court. (Alex Wong/Getty Images)</p> \n<p>In a sense, there was little that was new about the Supreme Court's June decision. When the high court first considered the patentability of software in the 1970s, it issued two rulings limiting patents on software. At the time, many people interpreted these opinions as holding that software could not be patented at all.</p> \n<p>But the courts became more friendly to patenting in the 1980s and 1990s, and by the end of the century, all meaningful limits on patenting software had been removed. As a result, the patent office issued tens of thousands of software patents per year in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Before long, the technology sector suffered from a surge of often-frivolous patent litigation.</p> \n<p>In the last decade, the pendulum has begun to swing in the other direction. Beginning in 2005, a series of Supreme Court rulings made patents harder to get and harder to enforce. Those rulings prompted lower courts and the patent office to place new limits on patents and patent enforcement.</p> \n<p>This year, in a case called <em>CLS Bank v. Alice</em>, the Supreme Court rejected a patent that claimed the concept of using a computer to hedge against counterparty risk — the risk that one party to a contract will fail to pay up. The high court ruled that abstract concepts like hedging weren't eligible for patent protection, and merely implementing an abstract idea on a computer wasn't enough to turn it into a patentable invention.</p> \n<h3>Why the <i>Alice</i> ruling could have broad implications</h3> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""2893590"" alt=""144948917__1_.0.jpg"" src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2893590/144948917__1_.0.jpg""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Google CEO Larry Page. (Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)</p> \n<p>The $64 billion question in the patent world is — what counts as an abstract invention? The Supreme Court was vague about this — it said that hedging against counterparty risk was too abstract a concept to merit patent protection, but it didn't say which software concepts, if any, were concrete enough to qualify for a patent.</p> \n<p>That's a worrying sign for software patent defenders because in a sense <em>all</em> software is abstract. At its most basic level, a computer program is a collection of mathematical algorithms. All computer programs take abstract data and manipulate it to produce other abstract data. If abstract patents can't be patented, that could exclude most or even all software from patent protection.</p> \n<p>Indeed, patent scholar — and software patent supporter — Robert Merges is worried about precisely that outcome. In a <a href=""http://www.scotusblog.com/2014/06/symposium-go-ask-alice-what-can-you-patent-after-alice-v-cls-bank/"">June blog post</a>, he used the famous PageRank patent, issued to Google founder Larry Page, as an example:</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>The Page patent claims what is known as the page rank algorithm: a way of weighting web pages by the density of links to them. The idea is that when a web search turns up various web pages that include the search term, the more important pages will be those that show a density of links to and from them. This idea was key to the early success of Google in gaining a reputation for superior search results, and the rest (as they say) is history. It is conceivable that the claims in this patent could be characterized as too abstract under <i>Alice</i>. If a court were to become convinced that the Page patent claimed the abstract idea of ""weighting,"" it might be invalid.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Another prominent patent scholar, Mark Lemley, <a href=""http://www.ipwatchdog.com/2014/09/04/the-ramifications-of-alice-a-conversation-with-mark-lemley/id=51023/"">predicted in September</a> that ""a majority of the software patents being litigated right now, I think, are invalid under <i>Alice</i>.""</p> \n<p>It's too early to know how far the courts will go in striking down software patents, but so far the <i>Alice</i> ruling seems to be having a big impact. Within three months of the Supreme Court's June ruling, lower courts had <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/9/12/6138483/software-patents-are-crumbling-thanks-to-the-supreme-court"">issued almost a dozen rulings</a> rejecting software patents. By November, the courts had <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/11/17/7222807/software-patent-invalid-record"">rejected at least 17 software patents</a>, more than in any previous year.</p> \n<p>The patent office, too, has <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/10/11/6958701/the-patent-office-is-rejecting-a-lot-more-business-method-patents"">made it dramatically harder</a> to get software patents. A study found that the division of the patent office that focuses on business methods — the type of software patent at issue in the <em>Alice</em> case — went from rejecting 24 percent of applications in January 2014 to rejecting 78 percent in July.</p> \n<p>There are still hundreds of thousands of software patents out there. But recent court rulings will have a big impact on the value of these patents even if most of them are never tested in court. That's because negotiations between patent holders and potential defendants are driven by each side's estimate of his or her chances of winning in court. As the courts become more skeptical of software patents, software patent holders will be less able to drive a hard bargain in licensing negotiations. Patent trolling will become less profitable and litigation less common. Greater judicial skepticism of software patents will depress the value of all software patents, not just those that ultimately wind up in court.</p> \n<p>In short, 2014 represented a turning point in the software patent debate. The Supreme Court ruled on whether you can patent software for the first time in a generation. And the results have been very bad for anyone who owns a software patent.</p>",Business & Finance

Snapchat's distinctive feature is that messages disappear a few seconds after they're opened. This ephemeral quality encourages people to send pictures on a whim. It's also made the app a popular way to send sexually explicit messages.</p> \n<p>Last year, Snapchat faced federal scrutiny over charges that its messages were <a href=""http://www.theverge.com/2014/5/8/5695530/snapchat-settles-with-ftc"">not as fleeting</a> as the company had claimed. And the company has been plagued with other privacy problems as well.

Comcast's rental cable modems are a rip-off. It's much cheaper to buy your own.,http://www.vox.com/2015/1/2/7481639/comcast-modem-rental-ripoff,Comcast has recently begun raising cable modem rental fees from $8 to $10 per month. Yet I was able to buy my own for less than $40.,"<p>One of Comcast's most ludicrously profitable businesses is renting out cable modems. These devices, which allow users to access the internet over cable networks, can cost as little as $30 if you buy them used. And until recently, Comcast was renting them out to people for around $8 per month. In other words, as little as six months of modem rental fees cost more than buying a device outright.</p> \n<p>Now <a href=""http://arstechnica.com/business/2014/12/comcast-just-upped-its-cable-modem-rental-fee-from-8-to-10-per-month/"">Ars Technica reports</a> that Comcast is raising its cable modem rental fee in many parts of the country to $10 per month. It might be time for you to buy your own cable modem and stop paying Comcast's inflated rental fees.</p> \n<p>I did this back in May. It was easy, and I've already saved more than the cost of the modem. You can do it too.</p> \n<h3>My cable modem cost just $37.94</h3> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""2897744"" alt=""20140913_141739_resized.0.0.0.jpg"" src=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2897744/20140913_141739_resized.0.0.0.jpg""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">The scene when I visited my local Comcast office in Washington, DC, to return my modem on September 13, 2014. (Timothy B. Lee/Vox)</p> \n<p>Getting my own cable modem was surprisingly easy. Here's how I did it. I looked at the cable modem Comcast had provided me and found the model number. A quick web search revealed that the exact same model was available on Amazon — refurbished and with a six-month warranty — for $30.95 plus $6.99 shipping and handling.</p> \n<p>Once I got the modem, setup wasn't too difficult. I called Comcast and told them I bought a new modem. They walked me through the setup process and then made arrangements to return the old device.</p> \n<p>Returning the old modem was the most frustrating step. The Comcast representative promised to send me a shipping box, but the box never arrived. So after waiting for two months I decided to go to the local Comcast office. The <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/9/17/6225869/comcast-this-is-what-a-monopoly-looks-like"">place was mobbed</a>, and I wound up waiting in line for more than 30 minutes to return my device.</p> \n<p>Still, the whole process — ordering the modem, installing it, and returning the old one — only took a couple of hours. I've already saved more in modem rental fees than I paid for the modem, and I may be able to use this same modem for years to come.</p> \n<h3>You can avoid modem rental fees too</h3> \n<p>I got a good deal. The modem I purchased <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/ARRIS-Touchstone-Cable-Modem-DOCSIS/dp/B008GG78FU/ref=cm_cr_pr_product_top"">retails for $69.95</a> on Amazon. The refurbished price has risen to $55 from the $30.95 I paid last year. And you might need to pay more if you need a modem that supports features such as voice calling.</p> \n<p><q class=""right"" aria-hidden=""true""><span>Getting my own cable modem was surprisingly easy</span></q></p> \n<p>Still, most of the devices on <a href=""http://mydeviceinfo.comcast.net/"">Comcast's list of approved modems</a> are available for less than $60 if you buy them used or refurbished. Some Comcast-approved modems are available used for <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Arris-TM602G-ARRIS-Telephony-Modem/dp/B0039UWW54"">less than $20.</a></p> \n<p>A foolproof way to make sure you get the right modem is to search Amazon for the exact same model of modem you currently have. Mine, for example, was an Arris CM820. That minimizes the risk of getting one that's not compatible with your current service.</p> \n<p>Getting your own modem does cost money up front, and it's a bit of a hassle. But with Comcast's modem fee rising to $10 per month in many parts of the country, you'll make that cash back in a few months.</p> \n<p>And the same advice likely applies for other cable companies. Vox's Todd VanDerWerff, for example, is a Charter customer, but he also saved money by buying his own modem.</p> \n<h3>Potential pitfalls to buying your own modem</h3> \n<p><span>After I published this story, a former Comcast tech wrote in to note that buying a used cable modem can be a hassle. That's because if a modem was previously registered to another Comcast customer, then Comcast will have to contact the previous customer to get the modem de-registered before registering the modem with a new customer.</span></p> \n<p>That's not the end of the world, and it might not be a problem at all (I bought a refurbished modem with no problems). But you could save yourself some hassle if you buy a new modem — and this is still likely to be a cheaper option than a year's worth of modem rental fees.</p> \n<p>The other potential pitfall is that tech support issues might be harder to deal with if you own your own modem. With a rented modem, your cable company will replace a defective modem free of charge. In contrast, if you own your own modem, the cable company might blame your modem for the problem and ask you to buy a new modem yourself. On the other hand, I've talked to a number of people who have purchased their own modems and haven't encountered this problem.</p>",Business & Finance

Schwartz dismisses this too quickly with the observation that ""less than 10 percent of retail sales take place online.""

Why oil prices are dropping down to $50 per barrel,http://www.vox.com/2015/1/5/7493799/oil-prices-chart,"It's all about supply and demand.

The supply of oil keeps growing — thanks in large part to the US shale boom. Yet demand for oil keeps sagging, due to weak growth in Asia and Europe.</p> \n<p><span>Basically, there's a lot more oil getting pumped out right now than anyone needs, and a lot is just getting stockpiled away for later. That's causing the price to drop:</span></p> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""2559242"" alt=""supply_vs_demand.0.png"" src=""https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2559242/supply_vs_demand.0.png""></p> \n<p class=""caption"" style=""text-align: start;"">(<a href=""https://www.iea.org/oilmarketreport/omrpublic/"" target=""_blank"">International Energy Agency</a>)</p> \n<p>This wasn't always the case. Between 2010 and 2014, oil consumption was rising steadily, but global oil production was struggling to keep up. Stockpiles were getting drawn down. That led to higher oil prices — around $100 per barrel — which spurred drillers in the US to <a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/fracking"" target=""_blank"">extract more oil</a> from shale formations in places like North Dakota and Texas. But that boom was partly offset by conflicts in oil nations like Libya and Iraq.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""right"">The supply of oil keeps rising more than expected — and demand isn't keeping up</q></p> \n<p>Since mid-2014, however, things have shifted. US oil production <a href=""http://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.cfm?id=19171"" target=""_blank"">is still rising upward</a>. Russia, Iraq, and Canada keep producing more oil too. Just as important, global oil demand <a href=""http://blog-imfdirect.imf.org/2014/12/22/seven-questions-about-the-recent-oil-price-slump/"" target=""_blank"">has weakened unexpectedly</a>, especially as economic growth in China and Europe have been slowing down. OPEC also played a role: at one point in November, onlookers thought that Saudi Arabia might cut back on its production to prop up prices. But the Saudis <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/12/16/7401705/oil-prices-falling"" target=""_blank"">don't want to lose market share</a> and have signaled that they won't make any cuts for the time being.</p> \n<p>End result? Oil traders expect that the supply of oil will remain plentiful for the foreseeable future, while demand will remain weak — which is exactly what that IEA chart shows. And, since the price of oil is determined <a href=""http://www.investopedia.com/articles/economics/08/determining-oil-prices.asp"" target=""_blank"">by contracts for future delivery</a>, these expectations for the future matter a lot. That's why oil prices keep falling.</p> \n<p>A lot of day-to-day price movements are related to this basic dynamic. On January 5, prices started falling yet again. Why? Because new data <a href=""http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2015-01-05/oil-extends-decline-from-5-1-2-year-low-as-supply-glut-lingers.html"" target=""_blank"">indicated</a> that oil exports from Russia and Iraq were hitting record highs. And, even though lower prices may eventually kill some costly shale-drilling projects in the United States, overall US oil production <a href=""http://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.cfm?id=19171"" target=""_blank"">is still expected to increase</a> in 2015. That expected increase in production has been enough to offset the news of fresh conflict in Libya (which is taking a smaller amount of oil off the market).</p> \n<p>In the meantime, few analysts expect growth to pick up in Europe or China or Japan anytime soon. So global demand is expected to remain sluggish in the near future.</p> \n<p><span>That's the short version. Whenever new data shows an unexpected boost in oil production or an unexpected drop in oil demand, prices go down. For oil prices to go up, we'd need to see either an unexpected drop in supply — say, new fighting flares up in Iraq, or US shale projects start going offline faster than expected, or Saudi Arabia switches its stance and decides to cut back on output to prop up prices.

"Sling TV, the new way to stream ESPN over the internet, explained",http://www.vox.com/2015/1/5/7496223/sling-tv-explained-espn,"A new service from Dish will let you watch ESPN, CNN, and other channels over the internet â€” without a cable subscription.","<p>We're getting closer to the point where you can cancel your cable subscription and still continue to enjoy all your favorite cable TV shows. Today at the Consumer Electronic Show, the satellite TV company Dish announced the next step in that direction. Sling TV is a service that lets you watch cable TV channels over the internet.</p> \n<p>Crucially, the Sling TV lineup includes ESPN, the nation's most popular cable channel and a must-have for sports fans. And unlike some other streaming services, you can sign up for it <em>without</em> getting a conventional cable subscription.</p> \n<p>Read on for all the details on Dish's new internet streaming service.</p> \n<h3>What's Sling TV?</h3> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""2906190"" alt=""television.0.jpg"" src=""https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2906190/television.0.jpg""></p> \n<p>Sling TV is a new video streaming service from Dish. In the past, Dish has focused on delivering video content via satellite dishes, but the new service streams video over the internet instead.</p> \n<p>Obviously, video streaming isn't a new concept. Companies like Netflix and YouTube have been doing it for years. What makes Sling different is that it's the first streaming service that feels like a cable television subscription.</p> \n<p>You can use it to stream traditional cable channels like ESPN and CNN to your TV without signing up for a traditional cable subscription.</p> \n<p>It's also dramatically cheaper than traditional cable. The service costs just $20 per month, with no contract. Dish says it will be available in the first quarter of 2015.</p> \n<h3>Do I need a Slingbox to watch Sling TV channels?</h3> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""2906194"" alt=""DSC05486-800.0.jpg"" src=""https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2906194/DSC05486-800.0.jpg""></p> \n<p> </p> \n<p class=""caption"">You can watch Sling TV with a Roku player. (The Verge)</p> \n<p> </p> \n<p>Dish is a corporate cousin of Sling Media, the company behind the Slingbox, a set-top box that enables personal streaming of television content. But according to the <a href=""http://about.dish.com/press-release/products-and-services/sling-tv-launch-live-over-top-service-20-month-watch-tvs-tablets"">Dish press release</a>, the two services are ""completely independent.""</p> \n<p>So you don't need a Slingbox to sign up for Sling TV. The service supports a wide range of streaming devices: Amazon Fire TV, Amazon Fire TV Stick, Google’s Nexus Player, select LG Smart TVs, Roku players, Roku TV models, select Samsung Smart TVs, Xbox One from Microsoft, iOS, Android, Mac, and PC. Notably, a <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00GDQ0RMG?tag=googhydr-20&amp;hvadid=62029585720&amp;hvpos=1t1&amp;hvexid=&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvrand=16936181658077330122&amp;hvpone=&amp;hvptwo=&amp;hvqmt=e&amp;hvdev=c&amp;ref=pd_sl_2yqprhk23r_e"">Fire TV Stick</a> costs just $40, so this service should be affordable to almost anyone.</p> \n<h3>Which channels can I get?</h3> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""2906236"" alt=""108744200.0.jpg"" src=""https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2906236/108744200.0.jpg""></p> \n<p> </p> \n<p class=""caption"">ESPN is among the channels available on Sling TV. (Jeff Siner/Charlotte Observer/MCT via Getty Images)</p> \n<p> </p> \n<p>Sling TV is the closest thing you can get to traditional cable service delivered over the internet, but the lineup is still pretty limited. The lineup <a href=""http://about.dish.com/press-release/products-and-services/sling-tv-launch-live-over-top-service-20-month-watch-tvs-tablets"">will include</a> TNT, TBS, CNN, Food Network, HGTV, Cartoon Network, Adult Swim, the Disney Channel, ESPN, and ESPN2. For many sports fans who don't otherwise want to subscribe to cable, ESPN and ESPN2 might be enough of a draw all on their own.</p> \n<p>However, you won't be able to get AMC, FX, or Comedy Central. Nor will you be able to get content from major broadcast TV networks like NBC or Fox. The companies behind these channels have prospered under the conventional cable industry structure, and so these companies are reluctant to rock the boat and potentially undermine their own business model.</p> \n<p>And notably, you won't be able to pick and choose which channels you want to subscribe to. You get a bundle of basic channels for $20 per month, plus the option of adding additional bundles for an added fee. But you won't have the option to just sign up for ESPN.</p> \n<h3>Why is this service being offered by a satellite TV company?</h3> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""2906250"" alt=""111771623.0.jpg"" src=""https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2906250/111771623.0.jpg""></p> \n<p> </p> \n<p class=""caption"">(Scott Olson/Getty Images)</p> \n<p> </p> \n<p>You might have expected a service like Sling TV to be offered by a Silicon Valley company like Google or Netflix, but Dish has a couple of advantages that makes it well-positioned to offer a compelling package of cable channels.</p> \n<p>For one thing, unlike most Silicon Valley firms, Dish has years of experience negotiating with content providers for the rights to cable channels. Channels like CNN and ESPN have been broadcast on Dish's satellite network for years, and experience negotiating those deals probably helped Dish talk those companies into joining the Sling TV lineup.</p> \n<p>At the same time, Sling TV is a blow against Dish's traditional rivals in the cable industry. Dish only holds around <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2013/03/28/how-we-size-up-dish-networks-pay-tv-outlook/"">13 percent</a> of the pay TV market, small enough that it doesn't have too much reason to worry about cannibalizing its core satellite TV business. Most of the customers they attract will come from the local cable company, not Dish.</p> \n<p>Dish also believes that Sling TV targets a different market than traditional satellite service. Sling TV is targeted at younger, more internet-savvy, and more cost-conscious consumers in their 20s and 30s. Dish is designed for older viewers who consume a lot of television content. Dish hopes to grow a big, new market in internet streaming without undermining demand for its satellite television service.</p> \n<h3>How scared should cable companies be?</h3> \n<p>So far, the cable industry has occupied an enviable position in the media ecosystem. While other 20th century distributors — record labels, newspapers, book stores, and so forth — have imploded, the cable industry has continued to generate handsome profits.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""right""><span>Sling TV isn't a full replacement for a conventional cable subscription</span></q></p> \n<p>That's partly because, until now, no one has been able to offer heavy TV viewers a compelling alternative to a traditional cable subscription. You can get individual channels from HBO Go, and you can stream an impressive amount of content from Netflix and Amazon Prime. But if you wanted to see new TV shows when they came out or watch live sports, none of the internet-based services provided a serious alternative.</p> \n<p>Sling TV isn't a full replacement for a conventional cable subscription, but it comes closer than any service that came before. The inclusion of ESPN will make the service particularly attractive to sports fans. So expect Sling TV to accelerate ""cord cutting,"" the process where households cancel their cable TV subscriptions in favor of internet content from services like Netflix and (now) Sling TV.</p> \n<p>However, the cable industry doesn't need to worry too much. Even after customers cancel their cable TV subscriptions, most of them are still getting their broadband service from their cable companies. So while cord-cutting isn't good for the cable industry's bottom line, it's not an existential threat, either. Even if internet-based streaming services totally destroy the traditional cable-television business, cable companies might get along just fine selling the bandwidth customers need to access online content.</p> \n",Business & Finance

How Hollywood could use trade law to create an internet blacklist,http://www.vox.com/2015/1/6/7503315/hollywood-internet-blacklist-trade-law,A document leaked by the Sony hackers reveals that Hollywood is working on a plan to convince an obscure trade agency to order broadband providers to blacklist pirate sites.,"<p>In 2012, online activists <a href=""http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/01/how-the-internet-killed-the-stop-online-piracy-act/"">decisively defeated</a> the Stop Online Piracy Act, legislation that would have created a government-backed internet blacklist. The idea became so toxic that content companies haven't made any serious effort to resurrect it in Congress</p> \n<p>Yet a <a href=""http://www.scribd.com/doc/250191712/Use-of-the-ITC-to-Block-Foreign-Pirate-Websites"">document</a> leaked in the Sony hack reveals that the Motion Picture Association of America, one of SOPA's most powerful backers, hasn't given up on the site-blocking concept. The memo was drafted in August by the law firm of Jenner and Block on behalf of the MPAA. It outlines a legal strategy to use a little-known agency called the International Trade Commission to force internet service providers to block access to sites found guilty of distributing pirated content — an idea strikingly similar to the one internet activists defeated three years ago.</p> \n<h3>Do trade laws apply to the internet?</h3> \n<p>The ITC is an agency that enforces the nation's trade laws, and one of its functions is to issue orders barring the importation of pirated and counterfeit goods. Traditionally, this meant physical goods like bootleg DVDs or knock-off pharmaceuticals. But in an April ruling, the ITC ruled that same law could be used to bar the importation of certain digital files.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""right""><span>The ITC sided with Align, ruling that digital models for retainers were 'articles' under trade law</span></q></p> \n<p>The case focused on a patent, held by Align Technology, that covered the concept of creating a series of plastic retainers that gradually shifted a patient's teeth into a new position. A company called ClearCorrect was designing retainers in Pakistan and then transmitting digital models of these retainers to the United States for fabrication. Since Align's patents covered the part of the process that occurred in Pakistan, ClearCorrect argued that US patent law didn't apply.</p> \n<p>But the ITC has the power to block the importation of goods (the law calls them ""articles"") that infringe patents. Align argued that the digital files ClearConnect transmitted over the internet from Pakistan to the United States qualified as an import goods. And this argument won the endorsement of the MPAA, which argued in a <a href=""https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2909538/digital-models-mpaa-comments.0.pdf"" target=""_blank"">pair</a> of <a href=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2909546/digital-models-mpaa-reply.0.pdf"" target=""_blank"">February briefs</a> that expanding the ITC's authority to cover over electronic transmissions would help the fight against piracy.</p> \n<p>In its <a href=""https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2909550/digital-models-opinion.0.pdf"" target=""_blank"">April ruling</a>, the ITC sided with Align, ruling that digital models for retainers were ""articles"" under trade law, and that the ITC could therefore bar ClearCorrect from ""importing"" them over the internet.</p> \n<h3>The MPAA's new anti-piracy plan</h3> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""2909248"" alt=""457654902.0.jpg"" src=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2909248/457654902.0.jpg""></p> \n<p> </p> \n<p class=""caption"">MPAA Chairman and CEO Chris Dodd. (Selin Alemdar/WireImage)</p> \n<p> </p> \n<p>Of course, Hollywood doesn't care how trade law applies to orthodontics. The MPAA is interested in combatting movie piracy. And a legal brief leaked by the Sony hackers lays out a roadmap showing how Hollywood might leverage that April ITC ruling to create a SOPA-style internet blacklist.</p> \n<p>If a digital model of a retainer is an ""article"" under trade law, then it seems logical that a pirated movie file could be an ""article"" too. And when the file is transmitted into the United States over the internet, that could amount to ""importing"" the file.</p> \n<p>The ITC stops the importation of counterfeit and pirated goods by issuing exclusion orders barring shippers, retailers, and other intermediaries from importing or distributing them. In its memo to the MPAA, the law firm of Jenner &amp; Block examines whether the ITC could order broadband providers like Comcast or Verizon to block the ""import"" of pirated movie files from overseas websites. The memo argues that the ITC might be persuaded to issue this kind of order.</p> \n<p>This argument would be something of a long shot. The ITC has the power to regulate two types of activities: importation and sale after importation. But it might be hard to convince the courts that US ISP are involved in either activity.</p> \n<p>A file will often pass through several networks as it travels from a foreign country to the United States. So the customer's ISP won't necessarily be the ""importer"" — the company that carried the file across the border. That could make it difficult to convince the ITC and the courts that broadband ISPs are importers under trade law.</p> \n<p>And ISPs don't exactly sell digital files, though they do sell the bandwidth customers need to download the files.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""right""><span>If a digital model of a retainer is an ""article,"" a pirated movie file could be an ""article"" too</span></q></p> \n<p><span>On the other hand, the ITC has taken a fairly broad view of its power to issue exclusion orders. And the law firm was optimistic it could bring the courts around. ""We may be able to develop a case that the network access ISPs, by virtue of the integral role that they play in the process of accessing and delivering infringing content from the foreign site to the end user, should be treated as an importer,"" the memo says.</span></p> \n<p><span></span><span>Similarly while ISPs aren't selling digital files, the memo suggests that ""we can argue that the term 'sale' should be read expansively to include the distribution of articles on the Internet as part of a network access ISP’s commercial service.""</span></p> \n<h3>A backdoor internet blacklist</h3> \n<p>The memo references two previous memos on the same topic dating back to 2012. That suggests that the MPAA has been considering this legal strategy for several years. Still, the industry hasn't made any of these arguments in court, and it's not clear if they will do so. I sent two emails to the MPAA seeking comment but didn't get a response.</p> \n<p>But if the MPAA does pursue this legal strategy, it could have huge implications for the future of the internet. ""This is basically a strategy to effectuate one of the most heavily criticized part of SOPA through a trade court,"" says Charles Duan, a legal expert at Public Knowledge.</p> \n<p>Duan argues that fighting online piracy is ""far afield"" from the job the ITC was created to do. He argues that if the government is going to get more aggressive about regulating online content, the  rules should be established by Congress through the legislative process.</p> \n<p>Also, treating digital transmissions as imports could create a lot of unnecessary headaches for internet users. ""If I'm communicating with someone in a foreign country, I don't normally think about whether my data is going through customs,"" Duan says. The internet is a single, global network that doesn't draw distinctions between domestic and foreign servers. In Duan's view, it would be a huge power grab for the ITC to assert jurisdiction over information that flows across international borders.</p>",Business & Finance
Twitter's CEO resigned. Here are four options for his successor.,http://www.vox.com/2015/6/11/8768323/turning-twitter-around,Twitter needs a new strategy to put an end to years of losses.,"<p>Twitter CEO Dick Costolo <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/6/11/8761731/twitter-trouble-facebook-twtr"" target=""_blank"">announced today</a> that he will step down. His replacement, not yet announced, will face some difficult choices, since user growth is slowing and the company lost $578 million in 2014.</p> \n<p>Here are four strategies Costolo's successor could pursue to turn Twitter around.</p> \n<h3>1) Focus on being more accessible to ordinary users</h3> \n<p>A lot of ordinary users find today's Twitter confusing and overwhelming. Under this strategy, Twitter would look for ways to make its wealth of information more accessible to casual users. For example, investor Chris Sacca has <a sl-processed=""1"" href=""http://lowercasecapital.com/2015/06/03/what-twitter-can-be-2/"">urged</a> Twitter to build a series of channels that allow people to quickly find information about particular topics, like a sports team, TV show, or election. These channels would display tweets related to the topic that have been carefully curated by Twitter staffers.</p> \n<p>Right now, Twitter displays tweets in strict reverse chronological order, but Sacca encourages Twitter to relax this assumption. Instead, when a user logs in, the platform should show a selection of the most interesting and insightful tweets that would have appeared on the user's timeline since the last check-in.</p> \n<p>The counterargument here is that a more accessible version of Twitter already exists. It's called Facebook, and it's wildly popular. The danger is that aping Facebook might alienate existing users more quickly than it attracts new ones.</p> \n<h3><span>2) Refocus on third-party apps</span></h3> \n<p><span></span>Another option, <a sl-processed=""1"" href=""https://stratechery.com/2015/twitter-might/"">promoted by analyst Ben Thompson</a>, would be to build lots of different apps that allow people to interact with the Twitter platform in different ways. Different apps could target different types of users, with some offering advanced features to power users, while others provide casual users with simplified ways to extract value from Twitter's firehose of information.</p> \n<p>The best way to do this would be to encourage third parties to build Twitter apps. But that's tricky because Twitter has burned a lot of bridges with developers since 2012, when it <a href=""https://blog.twitter.com/2012/changes-coming-to-twitter-api"" target=""_blank"">effectively killed off</a> many third-party Twitter apps.</p> \n<p>This is one reason Thompson called for <a sl-processed=""1"" href=""https://stratechery.com/2015/twitter-needs-new-leadership/"">called for Costolo to step down</a> back in April. Now that Costolo is out, Twitter's new CEO might have a better shot at convincing third-party developers to give Twitter's platform another shot.</p> \n<h3>3) Sell to Google</h3> \n<p>One of Twitter's most valuable assets is an unrivaled view into what's happening at this very instant. That knowledge could prove very useful to Google, whose mission is to ""organize the world's information."" Earlier this year Google and Twitter <a sl-processed=""1"" href=""http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-02-05/twitter-said-to-reach-deal-for-tweets-in-google-search-results"">signed a deal</a> to make it easier for Google to index tweets in real time. But if Twitter were a Google subsidiary, the search giant might find even more ways to extract value from this data — without requiring significant changes to the primary Twitter app.</p> \n<p>The big problem here is that Twitter is probably too expensive. Twitter is currently worth $23 billion, which is a lot of money even for a behemoth like Google. And Google may be able to accomplish many of the same goals at a small fraction of the price with the kind of strategic partnership the company signed earlier this year.</p> \n<h3><span>4) Focus on power users</span></h3> \n<p>A final option, <a sl-processed=""1"" href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/5/1/5672102/twitter-is-no-facebook-and-thats-fine"">advocated</a> by Vox's Matt Yglesias, is to simply accept that Twitter is never going to be a mass-market product on the scale of Facebook, and focus on serving the 300 million passionate users it has now as well as possible. This option would entail cutting back dramatically on research and marketing spending so that Twitter could earn a profit with limited revenue. The company might also focus more on selling premium ads targeted at its highly influential user base.</p> \n<p>The problem with this option is that Wall Street would hate it. The company's current valuation of $23 billion is based on an assumption that the company will be dramatically larger. Admitting that this won't happen could precipitate a crisis and lead to pressure for the current leadership team to step down.</p>",Business & Finance
Why Twitter hasn't grown as huge as Facebook,http://www.vox.com/2015/6/14/8777899/facebook-twitter-reddit-complicated,Twitter provides powerful sharing tools that ordinary users find confusing.,"<p>This past week was a bad one for both Twitter and Reddit. Reddit became embroiled in controversy after it <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/6/11/8767035/fatpeoplehate-reddit-ban"">banned a particularly vicious</a> subreddit called Fat People Hate. On Thursday, <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/6/11/8768323/turning-twitter-around"">Twitter CEO Dick Costolo resigned</a> after years of huge losses.</p> \n<p>Behind the problems of these two very different sites is a common struggle: most internet users don't particularly understand or like Twitter or Reddit. The average user finds both sites confusing and intimidating. Some — particularly women — find them downright hostile.</p> \n<p>Twitter and Reddit retained a do-it-yourself ethos of the early internet that gives users powerful sharing tools, but leaves it up to them to decide what to do with those tools. This ethos made them great, attracted power users, and helped them scale — but only up to a point. It's also become a big part of the reason the sites have struggled to appeal to the average internet user.</p> \n<h3>Popular technologies demand less of their users</h3> \n<p>If you walk by the desks of software developers here at Vox — or at virtually any other company — there's a good chance you'll see them using a Unix command-line interface that dates back to the 1970s. Geeks continue to use the Unix command line because —once you know how to use it — it's a powerful way to perform complex computing tasks.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""right""><span>Most users don't want to sift through large volumes of information</span></q></p> \n<p>But most users don't need the power, complexity, or hassles of using a Unix command line, which is why it never caught on with ordinary users. Until recently, most people used Windows PCs or Macs with a more user-friendly graphical user interface. More recently, people have been shifting toward even simpler computing technologies: smartphones and tablets. These mobile platforms provide fewer capabilities than a conventional PC — it's hard to write a blog post or manage a complex spreadsheet on an iPhone — but they're also easy to learn and demand little of users.</p> \n<p>The older, more complex computing platforms didn't die. Programmers still use Unix-based operating systems. Many white-collar professionals still use PCs. But for the average person, the complexity of a PC is more trouble than it's worth. So smartphones are becoming the most popular category of computer.</p> \n<h3>Facebook demands less of its users than Twitter does</h3> \n<p>A similar principle applies to social media technologies: the most popular services tend to be the ones that demand the least from their users. And Twitter demands a lot more of users than Facebook does.</p> \n<p>To make Twitter manageable, you have to carefully curate the list of people you follow to avoid being overwhelmed. The rules for Twitter conversations — for example, the fact that starting a tweet with someone's username will hide it from anyone not already following that user — are not intuitive to someone dropping by the site for the first, or even the 10th, time. And many users find it intimidating to write tweets that anyone in the world could read.</p> \n<p>Twitter helps users sift through a lot of information efficiently, which makes it invaluable for a media professional like me. But most people don't want to sift through large volumes of information. They just want to look at pictures of their friends' weddings, vacations, and babies with a minimum of hassle. And Facebook makes this really easy.</p> \n<p>Everything I've said about Twitter also applies to Reddit. For people who have mastered the site's complex rules, it's a fabulous place to find and share interesting content. But Reddit has a lot of arcane bylaws and an insular culture that's not always welcoming to newcomers. So while it has millions of users, it's not anywhere near as big as Facebook, nor is it growing as quickly as Instagram or Tumblr.</p> \n<h3>The openness of Twitter and Reddit makes them prone to harassment</h3> \n<p>Facebook is like a suburban shopping mall — it's a tightly controlled environment that tries to guarantee customers will never have a bad experience. Photos containing nudity are forbidden, for example, and users are required to use their real names. And because most Facebook interaction happens in private, there are few opportunities for strangers to harass one another.</p> \n<p>Twitter is more like a busy urban street. Users shout, and almost anyone can hear them. The service is designed to foster open-ended conversations among strangers, and some people have taken this as an invitation to harass others on the service.</p> \n<p><span>Reddit, meanwhile, is an urban street that happens to contain an open-air drug market and a red-light district.</span></p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""right""><span>Reddit and Twitter are designed to foster open-ended conversations among strangers</span></q></p> \n<p>In recent months, both sites have <a href=""http://techcrunch.com/2014/12/02/twitter-releases-new-suite-of-anti-harassment-tools-promises-faster-response-times/"" target=""_blank"">devoted more resources</a> to fighting this kind of abuse. But ridding the sites of abuse won't be easy, because the versatility of the tools Twitter and Reddit provide to their users means they are more prone to being used for malicious purposes as well as valuable ones.</p> \n<p>Regardless, the prevalence of online harassment represents another demand that these sites effectively place on their users. For certain users — especially women — spending time on Twitter or Reddit means you're more likely to have your day ruined by threats or crude insults. Which makes them less appealing than other sites that are designed to discourage this kind of abuse.</p> \n<h3>Why Twitter shouldn't try to become Facebook</h3> \n<p>Twitter is under immense pressure to expand its audience so it can generate the kind of revenues and profits Facebook does. But there are good reasons to think this won't work — and that trying to make it work might destroy the site in the process.</p> \n<p>Microsoft's struggles to adapt to the mobile revolution provide an instructive analogy. For years, Microsoft has been struggling to produce a version of its Windows operating system that works well on tablets. The result has often been products that occupy an awkward middle ground — neither as powerful as full-scale Windows PC nor as user-friendly as an iPad. It's hard to reduce the complexity of a Windows PC without simultaneously eliminating features that make it useful. After several flops, Microsoft has finally achieved <a href=""http://www.engadget.com/2015/01/26/microsoft-fiscal-q2-2015-earnings/"">modest success</a> with the Surface Pro 3, but Windows-based tablets are still a lot less popular than iPads and Android tablets.</p> \n<p>A similar point applies to social networks. Twitter's complexity isn't just a problem the company needs to eliminate, it's an essential part of what makes the site useful right now. Twitter facilitates a type of rich, open conversation that's much harder to have on a more restrictive platform like Facebook or Instagram. It's why its most committed users are so incredibly committed, and why they create so much valuable, free content for the service.</p> \n<p>While more complex products tend to be less popular in relative terms, they can still be huge markets in absolute terms. Microsoft is a hugely profitable company because it can continue selling its products to businesses that need the power of a full-scale PC. Similarly, the rapid growth of Facebook and Instagram doesn't mean that Twitter or Reddit is doomed; there will continue to be tens or even hundreds of millions of people who want to use these sites.</p> \n<p>Twitter's problem is that it hasn't found a way to monetize its relatively small but highly engaged and influential audience. Microsoft makes a lot of money from every Windows license it sells, so it doesn't matter that people buy fewer PCs than mobile devices. But advertisers don't seem willing to pay more to advertise to a Twitter user than a Facebook user. So Twitter's smaller audience has translated to a lot less money in the bank.</p>",Business & Finance
How to save Twitter,http://www.vox.com/2015/6/15/8782515/how-to-save-twitter,Worry less about Wall Street and more about users.,"<p>Twitter is in trouble again, leading to the <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/6/11/8761731/twitter-trouble-facebook-twtr"">resignation of CEO Dick Costolo</a> and an uncertain future with company founder and current Square CEO Jack Dorsey serving as ""interim"" CEO. Since media types love Twitter, even if Wall Street doesn't, the web is suddenly full of schemes to save the company. Except most of these proposals seem to take for granted that the core problem with Twitter is that shareholders are sad its stock price hasn't gone up since the company's IPO.</p> \n<p>But while this is certainly a problem of some sort, it's not a very <em>serious</em> one. Twitter is, after all, mostly owned by very rich people. If you want to know what multimillionaires think Twitter ought to do in order to make them even richer multimillionaires, <a href=""http://lowercasecapital.com/2015/06/03/what-twitter-can-be-2/"">you should probably listen to Chris Sacca</a>, who is very rich and owns tons of Twitter stock. Alternatively, Twitter could just try to bluff Apple and Google and maybe Facebook or Microsoft into some kind of bidding war to buy the company.</p> \n<p>But the actually <em>sad</em> thing about Twitter flailing isn't that it might make some rich people slightly less rich; it's that a service from which tens of millions of people around the world derive enormous value might collapse, vanish, or be ruined.</p> \n<p>Here's how to do what matters — save Twitter the service, not Twitter the wealth-maximization vehicle.</p> \n<h3>Have some self-respect</h3> \n<p>This is really the most important one. The big problem with Twitter, allegedly, is that it's a lot less popular than Facebook. And so it is.</p> \n<p>That said, Twitter has about 300 million monthly active users. By contrast, 114.4 million people <a href=""http://deadline.com/2015/02/super-bowl-ratings-patriots-seahawks-2015-superbowl-xlix-1201364688/"">watched the last Super Bowl</a>. Toyota sells about 10 million cars per year. There are 250 million people living in Indonesia. But professional football is not a failure, Toyota is the world's largest car company, and Indonesia is not a small country.</p> \n<p>This is the most important point to remember amid all the Twitter worrying: Twitter is <em>extremely</em> popular, it's extremely valuable to its heaviest users, and it's a service that's legitimately changed the world.</p> \n<p>If every product that couldn't meet the ""as popular as Facebook"" test spent its days wallowing in misery, flailing around in search of growth, then the entire business world would be in a constant state of chaos and upheaval. Twitter needs to do what grownup companies do — focus on what it's good at and get better and better at executing on it.</p> \n<h3>Forget about advertising</h3> \n<p>Yes that's totally insane. Advertising is how modern internet companies make money.</p> \n<p>And yet advertising on Twitter is a fundamentally dumb idea. In part, that's because so much of Twitter is free advertising — half of what you see on the service is celebrities, media personalities, politicians, small businesses, and national brands tweeting out little nuggets of this or that to promote themselves.</p> \n<p>This idea of self-promotion without advertising is at the core of what makes Twitter great. On Twitter, the way you deliver your message to people isn't to pay a centralized distributor or targeting algorithm. It's to craft a Twitter feed that is entertaining and relevant to the people you're trying to reach. When one of my favorite bands announced their next album in June, they didn't need an ad to get me to preorder it.</p> \n<p> </p> \n<blockquote class=""twitter-tweet"" lang=""en""> \n<p lang=""en"" dir=""ltr"">People of Tomorrow, here it is! ""Cascades"", the pounding heart of our new album, 'Pagans in Vegas' <a href=""https://t.co/JTXpEk3k4F"">https://t.co/JTXpEk3k4F</a></p> \n— Metric (@Metric) <a href=""https://twitter.com/Metric/status/605811980704751618"">June 2, 2015</a>\n</blockquote> \n<p> </p> \n<p> \n<script src=""//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"" charset=""utf-8""></script> \n</p> \n<p>I found it on Twitter because not only do I love Metric, I also love their Twitter account, with its <a href=""https://twitter.com/Metric/status/605784879926640641"">jokes</a> and <a href=""https://twitter.com/Metric/status/609028983619854336"">cool photos</a> and all the rest.</p> \n<h3>Charge users money</h3> \n<p>How much money? I'm not sure exactly. But the basic idea would be to combine a free tier, suitable to the needs of the majority of Twitter users, with one or more paid tiers for accounts that want to be able to amass large quantities of followers.</p> \n<p>Most people, in other words, would be able to use Twitter for free and follow all their favorite celebrities, sports stars, writers, etc. But a celebrity, sports star, writer, corporate brand, or small business that wanted to use Twitter as a publicity and promotional vehicle would need to pay. Maybe the free tier would be limited to 100 followers, and then you could have a cheap tier for power users and small businesses and an expensive tier for folks who wanted access to six- or seven-figure follower counts.</p> \n<p>If you wanted to square this business model with the current vogue for free, ad-supported services, you would say it's a free service (that's the tier most people use) that's financially supported by charging brands money for access to the platform so they can conduct native advertising campaigns.</p> \n<p>But call it whatever you want. The point is that you can make Twitter free for readers, and not-free for people looking to reach readers.</p> \n<h3>Improve the experience</h3> \n<p>Saving Twitter by radically changing it would be beside the point. Accepting that it shouldn't change too much would help stabilize the problem by reducing the need for R&amp;D expenditures. But without chasing the fantasy of dramatic transformation, the company should work on iteratively improving its core product:</p> \n<ul> \n<li> <b>Tackle harassment:</b> This is the number-one complaint about Twitter from actual heavy Twitter users. The level of Twitter harassment I experience is borderline unacceptable, and women and people of color I know get it 10 to 100 times worse. From a non–Wall Street perspective, this is the only aspect of Twitter that's genuinely broken. </li> \n<li> <b>Welcome back third-party developers:</b> Twitter began to go astray when it began limiting third-party developers' access to the Twitter API in order to more fully dominate the advertising experience. People will like Twitter better if they can choose from a competitive set of Twitter clients. Make this credible by demanding that third-party client developers share some of their revenue in exchange for API access.</li> \n<li> <b>Make @-replying work properly:</b> The art of holding a conversation on Twitter by placing @SoAndSo at the start of the message was originally a user hack rather than a feature of the platform. And even today, it works too much like a hack — displaying the username (rather than actual name) of the person you're replying to and counting the user name against the 140-character limit. </li> \n<li> <b>Verify people:</b><em> </em>Twitter's current approach to verification is snobbish and bizarre. The service should find a way to allow anyone who wants to be ""verified"" to link their Twitter account to a ""real world"" identity, rather than limiting that option to a somewhat arbitrarily defined group of public figures. </li> \n</ul> \n<h3>Let Twitter be Twitter</h3> \n<p>Twitter is a widely popular service that has fundamentally transformed the way people communicate and the way news and culture is experienced. It also happens to be pretty great. But like everything else in life, it could benefit from hard work and continued improvement. The great risk is that unrealistic Wall Street expectations, investor greed, executive panic, and a curious lack of self-confidence will destroy something truly useful and leave nothing of note behind.</p>",Business & Finance
Today's worst tech idea: the Wall Street Journal says Apple should kill the Mac,http://www.vox.com/2015/6/15/8784191/apple-kill-mac-nope,"Macs are great, and Apple should keep making them.","<p>I have no doubt that Chris Mims's <a href=""http://www.wsj.com/articles/why-apple-should-kill-off-the-mac-1434321848"">Wall Street Journal article</a> making the case against the Mac will attract clicks from throngs of angry Apple fans. But however brilliant the piece might be as an exercise in trolling, Mims's arguments for Apple to cancel its most venerable product line don't really hold water.</p> \n<p>The Mac is a popular, profitable, and prestigious product. It's usually a bad idea for a company to cancel a product like that, and this case is no exception.</p> \n<h3>1) Lots of companies make more than 3 great products</h3> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""3792864"" alt=""GettyImages-181938607.0.jpg"" src=""https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3792864/GettyImages-181938607.0.jpg""></p> \n<p> </p> \n<p class=""caption"">Larry Page, CEO of Google, a company with more than three successful products. (Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)</p> \n<p> </p> \n<p>""The world’s best tech companies can be the best at two things at once, maybe three,"" Mims writes. He then chooses the worst possible example to illustrate his point: ""Google Inc. is search, Android and ad platforms, plus a long tail of commitments that sometimes feel like someone’s pet project.""</p> \n<p>Those ""pet projects"" include the <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.youtube.com/"">world's most popular video-sharing service</a>, the <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.google.com/chrome/"">world's most popular web browser</a>, and an <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://mail.google.com/"">extremely popular email service</a>. They also include Google Docs, Google Maps, and Google Calendar. Google Maps isn't as profitable as Google's search engine, but it would be insane for Google to shut it down because it's only Google's fifth most successful product and Larry Page needs to focus more on the top three.</p> \n<h3>2) Maintaining old product lines is relatively easy</h3> \n<p><span>If Apple didn't have a PC business, it probably wouldn't make sense for the company to try to create one from scratch. </span><span>But the Mac is highly profitable, and it should continue generating profits for the foreseeable future with minimal oversight from Apple CEO Tim Cook.</span></p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""right""><span>It's a mistake to conclude that the Mac platform is unimportant</span></q></p> \n<p><span>Indeed, while Apple hasn't killed off the Mac, it has taken Mims's advice to a limited extent: the pace of Mac innovation slowed noticeably around 2007, when Apple introduced the iPhone. That's because Apple pulled many of its best engineers off of Mac projects to work on iPhone-related ones instead.</span></p> \n<p>So there's no reason to think that continuing to sell Macs is particularly distracting. A company might only be able to <i>focus</i> on a few products at a time, but it can easily have others that are running on autopilot.</p> \n<h3>3) PCs aren't obsolete</h3> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""3792900"" alt=""GettyImages-457316496.0.jpg"" src=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3792900/GettyImages-457316496.0.jpg""></p> \n<p> </p> \n<p class=""caption"">(Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)</p> \n<p> </p> \n<p>Mims dismissively describes Macs as ""a last-century technology."" Because mobile OSes are newer and there's more activity around them right now, a lot of people have made the mistake of thinking this means desktop and laptop computers are obsolete products. But that's a misunderstanding of what's going on.</p> \n<p>The best way to see this is to observe that most of the world's internet servers run on Unix-based operating systems such as Linux. Unix dates back to the early 1970s, and in some ways it seems horribly antiquated. Yet that doesn't mean people are going to start hosting websites on iPads soon. Rather, Linux works well for certain specialized tasks like running a web server, and it will continue to be used for that task for the foreseeable future.</p> \n<p>The same point applies to Macs. They're extremely well-suited to certain kinds of computing tasks — creating a spreadsheet, editing an image or video, writing a computer program, playing a complex computer game, and so forth — that you can't easily do with an iPhone or iPad. There's no reason to think iPhones or iPads are going to become good ways to perform these relatively more complex tasks anytime soon. So people are going to continue to want to buy PCs (from Apple and other companies) for the foreseeable future.</p> \n<p>Moreover, if Apple didn't have Macs in its lineup, the company would be more tempted to add PC-like features to the iPad in an effort to appeal to more demanding users. That would be bad for iPad users, who value the product's simplicity and don't really need the capabilities of a full-blown PC.</p> \n<h3>4) The Mac is a strategic asset for Apple</h3> \n<p>Apple sells a lot fewer Macs than it does iPhones, but it's a mistake to conclude from that that the Mac platform is unimportant. That's because Mac users are disproportionately important to Apple's broader business strategy.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""right""><span>Apple loves to create products that work seamlessly together</span></q></p> \n<p>The most obvious example of this is that people use Macs to create iPhone apps. Controlling the Mac platform makes it easier for Apple to ensure that the process of developing iPhone apps is as good as possible, which will mean more iPhone apps get made.</p> \n<p>Apple loves to create products that work seamlessly together. A recent innovation called Handoff, for example, allows users to continue a task such as a phone call from an iPhone to a Mac or vice versa. This kind of cross-platform innovation is a lot easier to do when a company owns both platforms.</p>",Business & Finance
Obama's trade agenda is in trouble. Here's why.,http://www.vox.com/2015/6/16/8786547/tpp-tpa-obama-filibuster,"The filibuster, labor groups, conservative money, and other factors are endangering the Trans-Pacific Partnership.","<p>President Obama suffered <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/6/12/8773145/democrat-tpp-obama-fail"">one of the most stinging defeats</a> of his presidency last week, as members of his own party in the House of Representatives overwhelmingly rejected a trade package he had championed. Supporters of Obama's trade agenda are now <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/16/us/politics/house-republicans-seek-way-to-revive-trade-bill.html?_r=0"" target=""_blank"">looking for a way</a> to revive the package, but the odds of success look grim.</p> \n<p>Last week's vote was over Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA), a set of programs that help workers who lose their jobs due to foreign competition. It's part of a package that also includes Trade Promotion Authority, which guarantees a prompt up-or-down vote on trade deals negotiated by the president. Obama argues he needs TPA (also known as ""fast track"") in order to conclude negotiation of the <a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/trans-pacific-partnership"">Trans-Pacific Partnership</a> (TPP), a controversial trade deal involving about a dozen Pacific Rim nations. But opponents of the TPP oppose fast track for the same reason, and last week they scored a major victory when opposition from House Democrats derailed the trade legislation.</p> \n<p><!--  ########  BEGIN SNIPPET  ########  --></p> \n<div class=""chorus-snippet s-related"" data-analytics-action=""link:related"" data-analytics-category=""article"">\n<span class=""s-related__title"">Related</span> <!-- Add links here --><a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/4/17/8438995/why-obamas-new-trade-deal-is-so-controversial"">The Trans-Pacific Partnership is great for elites.

However, the New York Times </span><a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/16/us/politics/house-republicans-seek-way-to-revive-trade-bill.html?_r=0"" target=""_blank"">reports</a><span> that ""</span>there were few indications Monday that large numbers of Democrats were ready to reverse themselves and send the trade legislation to the president’s desk.""</p> \n<p>Here are five reasons Obama's trade legislation — and with it, his broader trade agenda — is failing.</p> \n<h3>1) The filibuster</h3> \n<p>The problem facing President Obama and Republican leaders in Congress is that any package that can pass the Senate won't be able to pass the House, and vice versa.</p> \n<p>In the Senate, Democrats refused to vote for any legislation that didn't include Trade Adjustment Assistance. So Republican leaders agreed to include TAA in the trade package in order to win their vote.</p> \n<p>But in the more polarized House, this was a nonstarter: most House Republicans opposed it because it included TAA, while most Democrats opposed it because they didn't like the rest of the bill.</p> \n<p>The House allows legislation to pass with a simple majority, but the Senate has a de facto rule requiring the support of 60 out of 100 senators to pass legislation. Without this supermajority requirement, things would have been a lot simpler, because the Republican majority would have been able to pass the legislation with minimal help from Democrats.</p> \n<p>TPA enjoys a slim majority in the House and likely would get a majority in the Senate as well (49 Republicans voted for the Senate bill, so they'd only need to win one Democrat to get a majority of 50). However, under Senate rules, legislation needs 60 votes to pass. So the legislation needed at least 11 Democrats to vote for the bill. But the compromises required to get those 11 Democrats on board created a package that most House Republicans didn't like.</p> \n<p>So the filibuster created a Catch-22 for supporters of trade legislation: anything they did to get Senate Democrats on board would turn off House Republicans, and vice versa. So even though majorities in both the House and Senate likely support TPA, the legislation can't become law.</p> \n<h3>2) The Democratic base</h3> \n<p>Last Friday's vote in the House of Representatives represented a triumph for liberal groups, especially the labor movement, which has campaigned aggressively to defeat TPA as a way to derail the TPP. These groups didn't just kill legislation they thought was bad, they did it in the face of concerted lobbying by a Democratic president.</p> \n<p>An important development was AFL-CIO head Richard Trumka's <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/4/20/8445991/afl-cio-tpp-obama-trumka"">April announcement</a> that he would freeze donations to members of Congress pending the vote on fast track. That got the attention of Democrats, many of whom rely on labor money to run their campaigns. The pressure worked, and rank-and-file Democrats in the House rebuffed President Obama's pleas to support his trade package.</p> \n<h3>3) The Republican base</h3> \n<p>House Republicans didn't actually need Democrats to pass the Senate trade package. They're in the majority, and House rules allow legislation to pass with a simple majority vote.</p> \n<p>But Republicans in the House are under a lot of pressure not to vote for Trade Adjustment Assistance, which conservatives regard as wasteful government spending. And because TAA was in the Senate bill, the whole package can't pass unless the House passes it as well.</p> \n<p>The Club for Growth, which funds primary challenges against Republicans who are judged insufficiently conservative, <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/6/12/8774131/obama-gop-tpp-tpa"">declared the vote on TAA</a> a ""key vote."" That was an implicit threat to mount primary challenges against any Republican who voted yes. And the threat worked — House Republicans overwhelmingly voted against TAA, just like Democrats did, even though most Republicans would like Obama to have fast track.</p> \n<h3>4) Cronyism in the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement</h3> \n<p>Obama is seeking Trade Promotion Authority to help him pass the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which he is currently negotiated with countries such as Chile, Japan, and Vietnam.</p> \n<p>A lot of opposition to fast track comes from old-fashioned protectionists, but support for the Trans-Pacific Partnership has also been eroded by concern over provisions that have little to do with trade. These include investor-state dispute settlement — which <a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/trans-pacific-partnership/whats-isds-and-why-is-elizabeth-warren-so-upset-about-it"">critics say</a> makes it too easy for private corporations to challenge regulations they don't like — and measures designed to restrict generic drugs and boost the profits of big drug companies.</p> \n<p>These issues weren't necessarily the top priority for congressional Democrats who voted against the treaty — a lot of them sounded protectionist themes about the loss of American jobs. But concerns over the cronyism helped <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/22/opinion/paul-krugman-trade-and-trust.html?_r=0"">turn liberal intellectuals like Paul Krugman</a> against the treaty. That's important because it means the treaty lacked much of the trans-ideological elite support that previous trade deals have enjoyed.</p> \n<h3>5) The secrecy of the TPP negotiating process</h3> \n<p>The secrecy of the TPP negotiating process between the United States and other nations has given critics of the treaty a bit of an unfair advantage. If they make exaggerated claims about the treaty, defenders can't easily set the record straight. Moreover, the very concept of negotiating a treaty that affects everything from copyright law to investment disputes, and keeping it secret until negotiations are over, rubs a lot of people the wrong way. (It will become public before Congress votes on it, but only after it's too late to make changes.)</p> \n<p>Supporters of the TPP get exasperated by this. They argue that it would be impossible to negotiate a trade deal if every step in the process were public. And they're not wrong.</p> \n<p>But as trade deals have gotten more complex and more controversial, the secrecy looks less like a necessary expedient and more like a conspiracy against the public. If these deals are going to affect so many aspects of people's lives, shouldn't there be an opportunity for public input before the final draft is completed?</p>",Business & Finance
Why United is ending service to JFK,http://www.vox.com/2015/6/16/8790535/united-jfk,"Consolidating operations at their Newark hub makes sense, but it's also part of a disturbing trend toward less competition.","<ol> \n<li>United Airlines is halting service to New York's JFK Airport.</li> \n<li>Instead, transcontinental service to Los Angeles and San Francisco will be offered through the airline's hub at Newark Liberty International Airport.</li> \n<li>Service to LA and San Francisco is also being <a href=""http://newsroom.united.com/2015-06-16-United-Airlines-Strengthens-New-York-New-Jersey-Hub-with-Move-of-p-s-Transcontinental-Service-to-Newark"">upgraded with international-style amenities</a> for non-coach travelers. </li> \n<li>United's old slots at JFK will be taken over by Delta, which operates a hub at JFK.</li> \n</ol> \n<h3>United's move is all about consolidated operations</h3> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3796880/unitedexplained.0.png"" alt=""unitedexplained.0.png"" data-chorus-asset-id=""3796880""></p> \n<p>Consolidating operations at a single New York–area airport has a pretty compelling business logic. At Newark, United can offer connections to dozens of additional destinations, including smaller East Coast cities and major international centers.</p> \n<p>At JFK, United was limited to offering point-to-point service. That placed them in head-to-head competition with smaller carriers like JetBlue as well as with Delta's much larger raft of potential JFK connections. By shifting to Newark, United can build on its existing strength.</p> \n<p>Delta, by the same token, will benefit from the ability to add even more flights to its existing JFK hub.</p> \n<h3>Airlines are learning to compete less</h3> \n<p>Beyond efficiency considerations, however, the slot swap is also part of a trend whereby airlines are doing less direct competition with one another. This is probably necessary, since the <a href=""http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2013/06/27/airline_profits_losing_money_but_not_as_much_money.html"">airline industry was comically unprofitable for years</a>, but rebuilding profitability by eliminating competition is a bad trend for consumers.</p> \n<p>In this case, for example, part of what's happening is that even though Newark and JFK serve the same metropolitan area, they are still in different places. For residents of northern New Jersey, Newark Airport is much more convenient. Conversely, residents of Long Island find it much easier to get to JFK. By streamlining operations so that United's operations are consolidated in one airport and Delta's in another, both airlines gain a modicum of additional pricing power over suburbanites who have difficulty getting to an airport on the opposite side of New York City.</p>",Business & Finance
The Greece crisis doesn't scare the Eurozone anymore,http://www.vox.com/2015/6/17/8793945/greece-important,"Yanis Varoufakis and the Eurogroup are racing against the clock to avoid a default, but it doesnâ€™t matter much to anyone outside of Greece.","<p>Years ago, back when the Greek debt crisis and attendant political machinations in the Eurozone first hit the headlines, the media was full of people screaming at you to pay attention to arcane fiscal disputes in far-off European capitals. And they were right. At the time, there was a serious risk of financial contagion from Greece to other European countries that could have lead to the collapse of the Eurozone and all kinds of wild consequences for global banking, the world economy, and other big, important things.</p> \n<p>Now Greece's debt woes are <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/6/8/8747195/greece-crisis-explained"">back in the headlines</a>, and if you want to get caught up, <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/6/8/8747195/greece-crisis-explained"">we've got you covered</a>. But if you <em>don't</em> want to get caught up, that's okay! There's a big difference between this round of Greek drama and the previous one. This time it's really not that important. You don't have to pay attention.</p> \n<h3>The Greek crisis is very important for Greece</h3> \n<p>The crisis in Greece is <em>very </em>important for the nation of Greece. If you are Greek, if you live in Greece, if you have family in Greece, etc., this is very important.</p> \n<p>Basically, if Greece cannot work out a new deal with the people to whom it owes money (primarily the European Central Bank, the International Monetary Fund, and various richer European nations), then Greek people are going to experience some (more) terrible economic pain.</p> \n<p>Their country may leave the Eurozone, or the country may continue to formally use the euro but with Greek people unable to take their euros out of the country or exchange them for foreign money. Either way, the best-case scenario would be a healthy bout of inflation complete with lost savings and reduced incomes for pensioners and public employees followed by a reduction in the unemployment rate. The worst-case scenario would be the rapid breakdown of Greek politics and the further rise of the neofascist <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Dawn_(political_party)"">Golden Dawn</a> political party.</p> \n<p>Long story short — Greek people should pay attention to the Greece news.</p> \n<h3>The previous Greek crisis was important for everyone</h3> \n<p>Note that list of people to whom Greece owes money. Those are governments and government-backed institutions, not banks and individual investors.</p> \n<p>That's not an accident, it's a consequence of the resolution of the <em>last</em> Greek crisis.</p> \n<p>When that crisis happened, lots of Greek debt was owned by foreign banks. And lots of those banks also owned the debt of other European countries — notably Ireland, Portugal, and Spain — which had been hit by devastating recessions. This led to two big ways that Greece's crisis could become everyone's crisis:</p> \n<ol> \n<li>A Greek default could imperil the solvency of some foreign banks.</li> \n<li>A Greek default could lead people to anticipate defaults from other countries.</li> \n</ol> \n<p>In other words, a Greek default could have led to runs on both foreign banks and whole foreign countries, as panicky investors started selling things. And then behind the four PIGS (Portugal, Ireland, Greece, and Spain) lay Italy, a massively indebted country whose economy is also far too large for the rest of Europe to be able to avoid a bailout. People feared a worst-case scenario of cascading national defaults and the chaotic, unplanned collapse of the Eurozone. If that happened, the US economy, which was still fragile following the 2008 recession, could've fallen back into crisis.</p> \n<p>But in the end, Greek politicians and German politicians worked out a bailout deal. Then the European Central Bank assured everyone that no country would be forced into default as long as it was playing by the austerity-minded rules of Eurozone elites. There was no contagion.</p> \n<h3>Today, Greece is isolated</h3> \n<p>Greece is in crisis today because the deal the previous crop of Greek politicians worked out forced a steep fall in Greek living standards. The Greek government had to pursue a very austere fiscal policy, enact a series of unpopular changes to labor law, and, by staying in the Eurozone, was unable to use currency depreciation as a way of spurring job creation. As a result, Greece's unemployment rate has hovered at more than 20 percent for years.</p> \n<p>Naturally, Greek voters were angry about this. So they turned to an opposition political party — in this case the far-left Syriza — to lead them out of the abyss. And since January, Syriza has been asking for a better deal.</p> \n<p>But Syriza has a problem. The old risk that a Greek meltdown would burn the entire Eurozone has gone away. Greece's debt is in the hands of European governments, which are using that debt as a means of political control to force Greece to change its policies, not as an investment. And the European Central Bank is fully backing Portuguese, Spanish, Irish, and Italian debt, since all four of those countries are sticking with the program. If Greece defaults, nothing terrible happens to the rest of Europe. Syriza is playing high-stakes poker, but it has no cards, and everyone else at the table knows it.</p> \n<h3>European elites care more than you'd think</h3> \n<p>This naturally raises the question of why the drama keeps happening at all. Why don't Greece's partners call the bluff and walk away from the table?</p> \n<p>The reason is that the <a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/eurozone-crisis/what-is-the-eurozone"">Eurozone is more of a political project than an economic one</a>, and it's one that most of Europe's politicians believe in. If Greece were to leave the Eurozone, that would be a blow to the prestige of the project. Non-Greek politicians (and the voters they are accountable to) are not willing to pay a <em>large</em> price to avoid this outcome, but they are willing to pay <em>something</em>. Consequently, though Syriza isn't going to get anything close to what it promised Greece's voters, it really can get <em>some </em>kind of more generous deal.</p> \n<p>This has left Europe in an endless cycle of negotiations that break up, only to return, only to break up again. If a deal is reached, it will be at the last minute, and it won't drastically alter the status quo. If a deal isn't reached, we won't know until the last minute, and it won't have big consequences for the rest of the rest of the world.</p> \n<p>So if you're Greek, you really should be paying attention to this news. And if you're just interested in high-stakes economic stories, it's a fascinating, important story. But if you find all this mind-numbingly dull, well, this isn't 2010.

Supermarket egg prices were on the high side, but not historically high, at the <a href=""http://data.bls.gov/timeseries/APU0000708111"">Bureau of Labor Statistics' latest count</a>, and the New York Times reported that <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/17/business/bird-flu-sends-egg-prices-up-but-slowing-demand-prevents-shortages.html?hpw&amp;rref=business&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;module=well-region&amp;region=bottom-well&amp;WT.nav=bottom-well"">wholesale egg prices have been falling since June 9</a>. In part, the conflicting reports simply reflect the inherent uncertainties involved in collection and dissemination of price data. But they also reveal a national — and, to an extent, global — egg industry that is considerably more complicated than you might think. The eggs you see on your supermarket shelf are just a small slice of the overall industry, and the price quoted there has less to do with the laying habits of chickens than with the wily sales tactics of the retail industry.</p> \n<h3>Where did the egg crisis come from?</h3> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""3798888""><img src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3798888/Screen%20Shot%202015-06-17%20at%205.48.22%20AM.png""></div> \n<p>The underlying issue is an outbreak of avian influenza, first detected in December 2014, which has pushed up egg prices ever since. Recent detections are actually reasonably well-contained in the Midwest, and in some ways look less alarming this spring than they did over the winter. But the sheer quantity of chickens in Iowa — home to <a href=""http://www.aphis.usda.gov/wps/portal/aphis/ourfocus/animalhealth/sa_animal_disease_information/sa_avian_health/ct_avian_influenza_disease/!ut/p/a1/lZJNU8IwEIZ_i4ceS9Z-0OKtiFC-1BER2ksnTVOamTbtpCmM_HpDQcUZRc1ps3n3ze6ToBCtUcjxlm2wZCXH-WEfdqPJg29c98EYjxa9Oxjfvwzn7swxH3xLCQIluB15vuXMAMByDRgP-v7A6c0Bxt2_1cMPy4Pf6lcoRCHhspIZCnCVsToiJZeUyyhnscDiVYMaR2UjorQkTd3uMGcFzqOM4lxm55mE1RTXNGI8LUXRQjgebxnmH3oiTwklyxvK9_i98NBMRViCgtjopdA1qG6611i3SGzq2Ma2bthJmiSEOKbpHJv_Mt_orq_mG84enenEgKl9Elzi2wouAAwUYedHhD0LLf7Z9eQPb2qI-e18o2yxzPQDTbS-SPl4fEYZrS9QVh1s8jJu_2fg8dh01VWCplRQ0WmESmdSVjcaaLDb7TokIZ1NudVA-WjQmn5Gugr1uikK9VU6mSy-s8zKWqL1mRWqiuWycM3uk79_TovVwM63M8-7unoDNLMefw!!/?1dmy&amp;urile=wcm%3apath%3a%2Faphis_content_library%2Fsa_our_focus%2Fsa_animal_health%2Fsa_animal_disease_information%2Fsa_avian_health%2Fsa_detections_by_states%2Fct_ai_pacific_flyway"">about 30 million of the 47 million total birds afflicted</a> — means the economic implications have become more severe recently.</p> \n<h3>Why are some restaurants pulling eggs off the menu?</h3> \n<p><iframe width=""560"" height=""315"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/fqRiv_l2MLU"" frameborder=""0""></iframe></p> \n<p>That disruption in the egg supply should lead to higher prices seems reasonable enough, but the complete disappearance of eggs from some restaurant menus is a little more puzzling. One important issue here is that around a third of the eggs in the United States do not reach end users in shell form. Instead, they are cracked, separated, mixed, and pasteurized to create a variety of ""egg products,"" mostly bagged liquid eggs.</p> \n<p>These liquid eggs are then passed forward to restaurants and food manufacturers that use them as ingredients in creating packaged food products.</p> \n<p>A surge in the price of <a href=""http://enterprise.vnews.com/2015/05/17/bird-flu-increases-breaker-egg-price/"">wholesale breaker egg prices</a> impacts the industrial and restaurant sectors differently.</p> \n<ul> \n<li>For a food manufacturer, there is no better option than to just keep buying eggs and deal with the consequences by trying to raise prices or accept reduced profit margins. The eggs are only one of several ingredients in the final product, and the investment in the food factory is too high to shut it down. </li> \n<li>A restaurant is in a different position. Restaurants normally sell lots of things that aren't eggs, so pulling eggs from the menu is viable. Restaurants also normally don't like to rapidly shift the prices on their menus, both for logistical reasons and to avoid annoying customers. Simply pulling eggs from the menu can be appealing in this situation.</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>Why are some supermarkets limiting egg sales?</h3> \n<p>This has to do with the complexities of supermarket pricing strategy. Large stores typically regard weakly branded staple foods — things like eggs — more as a way to get people in the door than as a way to make money, per se. They are willing to accept razor-thin and at times negative profit margins on these frequently purchased staples in order to ensure a steady flow of foot traffic to other, potentially more lucrative aisles.</p> \n<p>That means that at times of supply crunch, many supermarkets would prefer to avoid massive price increases if they can. Since egg wholesalers have no such compunction, this means that when the market is disrupted, making bulk purchases of eggs at big grocery stores can start to look attractive to small restaurants. This undercuts the supermarket's goal of increasing foot traffic. A policy <a href=""http://www.expressnews.com/business/local/article/H-E-B-rationing-eggs-6308013.php"">limiting the number of cartons of eggs a customer can buy at one time</a> makes it all work, but can also create an unreasonable sense of alarm in consumers. It's not exactly that the world is running out of eggs, it's just that supermarkets are trying to offer a bargain to regular households <em>without</em> offering a bargain to business buyers.</p> \n<h3>Why are some restaurants completely unaffected?</h3> \n<p>Different restaurants have different suppliers and different contractual arrangements, so the specific impact of the avian flu on any given business can vary widely. Richard Webner of the San Antonio Express News found one <a href=""http://www.expressnews.com/business/local/article/Whataburger-limiting-breakfast-hours-6299758.php"">breakfast entrepreneur who is reaping a windfall</a>:</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>Eggs are an ingredient in almost every dish at Magnolia Pancake Haus, co-owner Robert Fleming said. He buys about 22,000 to 25,000 cases a year, containing 15 dozen eggs each. But he’s avoided the turmoil in the egg industry thanks to a contract he has with an egg producer.</p> \n<p>Fleming decided in 2013 to start getting his eggs by contract to avoid the ups and downs that have buffeted the industry in recent years. Earlier this year, when prices were lower, he was paying about 12 percent more than market cost. Now, he’s paying about 30 percent to 40 percent below.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>An economics textbook might tell you that Fleming should take advantage of his cheap egg situation by simply reselling eggs to other Texas businesses, smoothing prices throughout the region. In the real world, however, transaction costs and uncertainty tend to inhibit this kind of adjustment. Consequently, the practical impact of the bird flu on the price structure of any given business can vary wildly.</p> \n<h3>What's next for eggs?</h3> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""3799000""><img src=""https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3799000/Screen%20Shot%202015-06-17%20at%206.29.30%20AM.png""></div> \n<p>According to the <a href=""http://search.ams.usda.gov/MNDMS/2015/06/PY20150615BShellEgg.pdf"">June 15 issue</a> of the US Department of Agriculture's <a href=""http://www.ams.usda.gov/AMSv1.0/ams.fetchTemplateData.do?template=TemplateR&amp;leftNav=MarketNewsAndTransportationData&amp;page=PYMNReportEgg1"">Egg Market Report</a>, the egg situation appears to be stabilizing just as the media frenzy about eggs is heating up. The reason? People have started buying fewer eggs. ""Retail demand is mostly light,"" they report, as supermarkets have gotten less worried about running out of eggs that are a challenge to make money off of. ""Breaking stock supplies are moderate to heavy for a usually light demand,"" as the impact of restaurant de-egging begins to work its way back up the chain.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, the USDA recently approved a Dutch plan to begin <a href=""http://www.usnews.com/news/business/articles/2015/06/08/us-to-import-egg-products-from-netherlands-to-ease-shortage"">exporting egg products to the United States</a>, the first time since 2002 that non-Canadian eggs will be allowed into the United States. With demand tempered by higher prices and new supplies from Europe coming online, it's likely that the June egg crisis will be forgotten as swiftly as it arose.</p> \n<h3>Should I be worried about bird flu transmission to humans?</h3> \n<p>So far, that's <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/5/7/8564539/bird-flu-pandemic"">only a concern if you're a chicken farmer</a>, but things could get worse — and, yes, this is a lot more alarming than a temporary egg shortage.</p>",Business & Finance
California regulators just took a big step to hurt Uber,http://www.vox.com/2015/6/17/8796707/uber-employes-california,"A ruling that drivers are employees, not independent contractors, is a threat to Uber's business model.","<p> </p> \n<ul> \n<li><span>The California Labor Commission has ruled that Uber drivers are employees, not independent contractors as the company had claimed.</span></li> \n<li> <span>A San Francisco–based driver, </span><span>Barbara Berwick, filed a complaint with the commission arguing that Uber must reimburse her for thousands of dollars in expenses she incurs as a driver.</span> </li> \n<li><span>The <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.buzzfeed.com/johanabhuiyan/california-labor-commission-rules-san-francisco-based-uber-d#.gwxX0ZvmWQ"">ruling</a> could be a serious threat to Uber's business model, which relies on maintaining a flexible workforce that sets its own hours and doesn't receive employment benefits.</span></li> \n</ul>",Business & Finance
A California regulator says an Uber driver is an employee. Hereâ€™s why thatâ€™s a big deal.,http://www.vox.com/2015/6/17/8799951/uber-california-ruling-explained,"Uber drivers could become eligible for overtime, workers' compensation, collective bargaining, and other rights.","<p>A California regulator has dealt a serious blow to Uber, ruling that an Uber driver is legally an employee of the company. California Labor Commissioner Julie Su rejected Uber's argument that drivers are independent contractors.</p> \n<p>If the ruling is upheld by the courts, it would have big implications for Uber and other companies that have emulated Uber's business model. Employees enjoy a number of legal rights that are not available to independent contractors. Classifying Uber drivers as employees could entitle them to minimum wage and overtime pay, compensation for expenses incurred on the job, workers' compensation and unemployment benefits, and more.</p> \n<p>But transforming Uber drivers — and others who work in the so-called ""sharing economy"" — into full-blown employees might also create some problems. Uber drivers are free to set their own hours, working as many or as few hours as they like in any particular week. Classifying workers as employees could force Uber to place limits on when and how much drivers work, which could be bad for everyone.</p> \n<h3>The difference between an employee and a contractor</h3> \n<p> </p> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3801470/GettyImages-487950535.0.jpg"" alt=""GettyImages-487950535.0.jpg"" data-chorus-asset-id=""3801470""></p> \n<p> </p> \n<p class=""caption"">When you hire a plumber, it will probably be as an independent contractor rather than an employee. (Ambient Images/UIG via Getty Images)</p> \n<p> </p> \n<p>The law in California (and other states) draws a fundamental distinction between employees and independent contractors. Employees have a direct, long-lasting relationship with their employers, and as a consequence they are eligible for a number of benefits and legal protections.</p> \n<p>Independent contractors, on the other hand, are service providers with an arms-length relationship to their customers. For example, if you hire a plumber or electrician to do work on your house, that person might be classified as an independent contractor. It wouldn't make sense for the law to treat everyone who pays for outside help on their house as an employer.</p> \n<p>Whether a worker is an employee or an independent contractor is an issue that's decided by regulators and the courts. Employers can't opt out of the legal requirements of labor law merely by getting employees to agree to call themselves independent contractors.</p> \n<h3>Uber was pushing the boundaries of labor law</h3> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3801462/GettyImages-450502046.0.jpg"" alt=""GettyImages-450502046.0.jpg"" data-chorus-asset-id=""3801462""></p> \n<div> \n<p class=""caption"">Lyft has also faced controversy for classifying its drivers as independent contractors. (Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)</p> \n</div> \n<p>Uber has been pushing the boundaries of the independent contractor classification. There are a number of ways that Uber drivers seem a lot like conventional employees. Uber drivers must undergo a lengthy application and background checking process before they can begin work. Many drivers treat Uber as a full-time job, working 40 or more hours per week for months at a time.</p> \n<p>Uber sets a wide variety of rules governing how drivers should provide services to Uber passengers. Drivers' fees are fixed by Uber, and Uber sometimes provides drivers with bonuses, minimum earning guarantees, and other forms of compensation that don't come directly from customers.</p> \n<p>On the other hand, there were a few characteristics that — in Uber's view — distinguished its drivers from conventional employees. Normally, employers set their employees' schedules, requiring them to work a minimum number of hours and often dictating when and where to report for work. By contrast, Uber drivers set their own schedules. They can work as much or as little as they want, and they decide which parts of town to work in.</p> \n<p>Employees generally use equipment supplied by their employers, while independent contractors usually supply their own tools. Uber cited the fact that drivers supplied their own vehicles as evidence that they were independent contractors. Uber argued that it merely provided a kind of online marketplace — like an eBay for transportation services — connecting independent ride providers with customers who wanted to purchase their services.</p> \n<h3>Why the California Labor Commissioner ruled against Uber</h3> \n<p>But the California Labor Commissioner rejected Uber's arguments. Su ruled that regardless of what Uber chooses to call its workers, they still meet California's definition of employees.</p> \n<p>""Defendants [e.g. Uber] hold themselves out as nothing more than a neutral technological platform, designed simply to enable drivers and passengers to transact the business of transportation,"" the California regulators wrote.</p> \n<p><q class=""right"" aria-hidden=""true""><span>Regardless of what Uber chooses to call its workers, they still meet California's definition of employees</span></q></p> \n<p>""The reality, however, is that Defendants are involved in every aspect of the operation. Drivers cannot use Defendants' application unless they pass Defendants' background and DMV checks. Defendants control the tools the drivers use. Defendants monitor the Transportation Drivers' approval ratings and terminate their access to the application if the rating falls below a specific level.""</p> \n<p>The Labor Commissioner concluded that the plaintiff, a San Francisco Uber driver named Barbara Berwick, was an Uber employee.</p> \n<h3>Classifying drivers as employees has big consequences</h3> \n<p>The reason this question matters so much is that a lot of legal obligations hinge on whether a worker is classified as an employee.</p> \n<p><q class=""right"" aria-hidden=""true""><span>Employees are entitled to earn a minimum wage, and to overtime if they work long hours</span></q></p> \n<p>Berwick's complaint focused on one particular labor law requirement: employers must reimburse employees for expenses incurred on the job. She drove 6,468 miles as an Uber driver, which at standard IRS reimbursement rates corresponds to $3,622 in vehicle maintenance costs. She also incurred $256 in tolls. The Labor Commissioner ordered Uber to pay this amount to Berwick.</p> \n<p>And according to Rebecca Smith of the National Employment Law Project, classifying Uber drivers as employees could trigger a number of other requirements. Employees are entitled to earn a minimum wage, and to overtime if they work long hours. Employees have collective bargaining rights. Employees can also be eligible for workers' compensation and unemployment benefits.</p> \n<p>If this week's ruling is upheld by the courts, it will create opportunities for other drivers to file complaints about Uber's labor practices, forcing Uber to provide its employees with more employment benefits and protections.</p> \n<h3>This week's ruling is part of a larger fight</h3> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3801478/GettyImages-464248795.0.jpg"" alt=""GettyImages-464248795.0.jpg"" data-chorus-asset-id=""3801478""></p> \n<p> </p> \n<p class=""caption"">FedEx has also faced controversy for allegedly misclassifying its delivery people as independent contractors. (STAN HONDA/AFP/Getty Images)</p> \n<p> </p> \n<p>Berwick isn't the only Uber driver seeking to be classified as an employee. And Uber isn't the only company facing this kind of legal challenge.</p> \n<p>Uber is facing a <a href=""http://www.latimes.com/business/technology/la-fi-tn-uber-lyft-class-action-2015-03-12-story.html"">separate class-action lawsuit</a> from Uber drivers who want employee status. This week's ruling will provide a helpful precedent for the plaintiffs in that case, but its outcome is uncertain. Uber's main competitor, Lyft, is facing similar suit.</p> \n<p>Other companies have also faced litigation over charges that they misclassified their employees. This week, FedEx <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/robertwood/2015/06/16/fedex-settles-driver-mislabeling-case-for-228-million/"">agreed to pay $228 million</a> to settle charges it had improperly classified its delivery drivers in California as independent contractors.</p> \n<p>The fundamental question here is how closely regulators and the courts should scrutinize a company's unilateral declaration that its workers are independent contractors rather than employees. Uber's defenders argue that the flexibility of independent contractor status is important for startups that are trying to create new types of businesses.</p> \n<p>Wage and hour regulations are one area where applying conventional labor law could prove counterproductive. Unlike a conventional employer, Uber doesn't tell employees when or how much they have to work. Employees are free to work as few or as many hours as they want, and they're free to work at times of peak demand, or at times that are most convenient to their schedules.</p> \n<p>If Uber was subjected to minimum wage and overtime laws, this would likely lead to new restrictions on when and how much workers can drive. Workers might be prohibited from working more than 40 hours per week, to avoid triggering overtime pay requirements. And Uber might limit how many drivers log in during low-demand period to guarantee that workers earn at least the minimum rate during those hours.</p> \n<p>Ian Adams, an analyst at the free-market R Street Institute, argues that the best solution would be to create a new legal category for people who work for on-demand services like Uber and Lyft. This category would provide workers with some benefits of employees — such as expense reimbursements and worker's compensation — but wouldn't provide other benefits such as sick leave and unemployment benefits.</p> \n<h3>The ruling probably won't destroy Uber's business model</h3> \n<p>Obviously, a ruling that reduces Uber's flexibility and forces it to provide more generous benefits to its drivers isn't great for the company. But there's reason to be skeptical of fears that treating drivers as employees will doom the business model of Uber or ""sharing economy"" companies more generally.</p> \n<p>Uber is a big enough company that it can easily afford to comply with California's labor regulations. And while those regulations may increase Uber's costs somewhat, Uber should be able to pass on those costs to consumers — especially because competitors will likely be forced to bear the same costs. <span>Where the ruling could hurt Uber is by reducing its ability to experiment with different scheduling and compensation models.</span></p> \n<p>A key point here is that while the ruling would force Uber to pay its employees more for things like expense reimbursement, this won't necessarily have a big effect on drivers' take-home compensation. Right now, drivers deduct their expenses from their gross pay. If Uber has to start reimbursing drivers for their expenses, the company should be able to reduce drivers' base compensation by a corresponding amount, leaving drivers' net pay little changed.</p> \n<p>Many of the costs of the ruling could fall on parties other than Uber. One is the drivers themselves. Obviously, many drivers will benefit from the protections afforded by labor law. But others might be harmed. For example, Uber might limit drivers' freedom to choose when and how much to work to ensure that they do not run afoul of minimum wage, overtime, and other rules tied to workers' schedules.</p> \n<p>The ruling could also harm would-be Uber competitors, especially if it is emulated in other states. Uber is a big enough company that it can easily absorb the costs of complying with labor laws in 50 states. Smaller companies trying to pursue an Uber-like business model might find the administrative burden too much. Ironically, then, the ruling against Uber could provide Uber with a modest barrier against new competitors in the long run.</p> \n<p>And ultimately, the costs of the ruling may be passed on to consumers in the form of higher fares.</p> \n<p><b>Correction:</b> I originally referred to ""the California Labor Commission,"" but there's no such body. The ruling came from California Labor Commissioner Julie Su. Also, I changed the headline to say ""an Uber driver,"" rather than ""Uber drivers,"" is an employee.</p>",Business & Finance

But being able to hold hands with the person you love, or be respected in a meeting, matters a lot in life.</p> \n<p><b>2)</b> Am I a single 20-something in this analogy? Or am I a 40-year-old with three kids? Child care, health insurance, and higher education were much cheaper in 1980. How you value them against smartphones probably depends on whether you have kids, or whether you're sick (and if you're sick, with what — treatments for heart disease are much better today than they were in 1980!).</p> \n<p><b>3) </b>I checked my email probably 200 times a day until making some serious resolutions and installing some blocking software. One way to interpret my old state of email mania is that I derive incredible value from checking my email. Another way to interpret it — a way I think is truer — is that I was addicted to checking email in a way that was providing substantial negative value to my life. I definitely use Twitter, but would I truly be less happy in a world where Twitter didn't exist and I read more of the New Yorker? I'm skeptical.</p> \n<p><b>4)</b> That said, I don't think economists have even begun to figure out how to value technological change, and I'm not sure it's possible to do. If you tracked my household purchasing, you would think I cared about my dining room chairs about as much as I cared about six months of internet access. I do not.</p> \n<p><b>5)</b> Air quality is <a href=""http://www.epa.gov/airtrends/aqtrends.html#comparison"">a lot better</a> today than it was in 1980.<strong> </strong></p> \n<p><b>6)</b> Human beings are pretty bad judges of what will and won't make them happy. The happiness literature is pretty clear on this point: all kinds of stuff that we think will make us much happier — like buying a big house — quickly fade into our baseline. All kinds of things we think will make us much less happy — like losing a limb — we end up adjusting to. One of the main exceptions? <a href=""https://ideas.repec.org/p/zur/iewwpx/151.html"">Commuting times</a>.</p> \n<p><b>7)</b> One thing we do know, though, is that human beings are very loss-averse. So the idea of losing the things I have today in order to live in 1980 is unbearable. But I also don't think I am a happier, more satisfied person today than I would be if I'd been born 15 years earlier. My guess is this question tells us more about how human beings value what they already have than whether people really should prefer one period to the other.</p> \n<p><b>8)</b> Similarly, we know that people are very bothered by relative inequality. It's one thing to go without a smartphone in an age where everyone has smartphones. It's another to go without a smartphone in an age where no one does. The 1980 society is more equal than the 2015 society and, in this counterfactual, you are much higher up the income ladder in the 1980 society than you are in the 2015 society. That kind of thing really does make a difference.</p> \n<p><b>9)</b> A related question that is interesting to think about, though obviously has some of the same problems, is how far back you would be willing to go if money were no object. Given the recency of antibiotics and statins, for instance, I wouldn't be willing to live in 1900 no matter how rich the Lord of Counterfactuals made me.</p>",Business & Finance
Larry Summers wrote the scariest op-ed you'll read this month,http://www.vox.com/2015/6/20/8818569/larry-summers-greece,Warns Europe is on the verge of a World War I-scale mistake.,"<p>As I <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/6/17/8793945/greece-important"">wrote on Thursday</a>, leaders in the eurozone and elsewhere around the world are no longer terrified that Greece defaulting on its debts would lead to a massive financial crisis. That's one of the main reasons Greece's creditors are so comfortable taking a tough line on the Greek government, which, in turn, is one reason a deal is so hard to achieve.</p> \n<p>Larry Summers — the economist and former senior policymaker in the Clinton and Obama administrations —  <a href=""http://t.co/YTtGV9J07N"">says this complacency is dangerous</a> in a scary new op-ed in the Washington Post. He concedes that ""there are good reasons to think enough foam has been placed on the runway to prevent financial contagion."" But he reminds us that ""this was asserted with respect to LTCM, subprime and the fall of Lehman."" And, indeed, the lead-up to Lehman's collapse featured things like articles <a href=""http://blogs.wsj.com/marketbeat/2008/09/11/why-lehman-brothers-is-not-bear-stearns/"">explaining why Lehman Brothers was no Bear Stearns</a>.</p> \n<p>The op-ed is paywalled, but suffice it to say that Summers is really amping up the panic level. Some choice lines:</p> \n<ul> \n<li>""Historians understand how the first world war was allowed to start but are still, a century later, incredulous that it happened.""</li> \n<li>""Greece will get far worse than it is today and it will probably become a failed state.""</li> \n<li>""A massive northern out-migration of Greeks will strain national budgets throughout Europe — not to mention the challenges that will come as Russia achieves a presence in Greece.""</li> \n<li>""Financial historians may look back at the events of next week and wonder how Europe’s financial unravelling was permitted.""</li> \n</ul> \n<p>So who's right? I have to say that Summers is <em>probably</em> wrong here. People have had years to recognize that Greece might end up defaulting on its debts, and the very extended negotiating process since January means there's truly no chance of a surprise.</p> \n<p>But probably may not be good enough here. How hard do you want to work to avoid a 40 percent chance of financial crisis? 20 percent? 10 percent? 5 percent?</p>",Business & Finance

Helluva guy.</p> \n<p>As you've probably already guessed, Pete is Mr. Money Mustache. But the difference between the two ways of looking at his life isn't just a trick. There's <a href=""http://www.voxeu.org/article/how-retiring-makes-unemployed-happier"">economic research </a>showing that when the long-term unemployed retire, they become happier — even though nothing about their situation has changed.</p> \n<p>I found myself thinking a lot about Mr. Money Mustache and the unemployment/retirement difference after reading Derek Thompson's <a href=""http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2015/07/world-without-work/395294/"">exploration</a> of a post-work world.</p> \n<p>Thompson is trying to imagine a world in which automation and outsourcing have replaced tens of millions of jobs — and no new jobs have risen in their place. He is trying to imagine a world in which there is plenty of prosperity, but not much work. He considers all the usual alternatives — hobbies, a guaranteed basic income, the wonderful promise of leisure — but finds them wanting:</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>When I think about the role that work plays in people’s self-esteem—particularly in America—the prospect of a <em>no-work</em> future seems hopeless. There is no universal basic income that can prevent the civic ruin of a country built on a handful of workers permanently subsidizing the idleness of tens of millions of people.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>He notes that for all the complaints people make of their work, unemployment is typically experienced as a psychic and social trauma:</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>Time-use surveys show that jobless prime-age people dedicate some of the time once spent working to cleaning and childcare. But men in particular devote most of their free time to leisure, the lion’s share of which is spent watching television, browsing the Internet, and sleeping. Retired seniors watch about 50 hours of television a week, according to Nielsen. That means they spend a majority of their lives either sleeping or sitting on the sofa looking at a flatscreen. The unemployed theoretically have the most time to socialize, and yet studies have shown that they feel the most social isolation; it is surprisingly hard to replace the camaraderie of the water cooler.</p> \n<p>Most people want to work, and are miserable when they cannot. The ills of unemployment go well beyond the loss of income; people who lose their job are more likely to suffer from mental and physical ailments. ""There is a loss of status, a general malaise and demoralization, which appears somatically or psychologically or both,"" says Ralph Catalano, a public-health professor at UC Berkeley. Research has shown that it is harder to recover from a long bout of joblessness than from losing a loved one or suffering a life-altering injury.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Which brings me back to Mr. Money Mustache. How much of the trauma of unemployment comes from the weight of society's disapproval, the shame that comes when a friend of a friend asks, ""And what do you do?""</p> \n<p>One of the hardest things about imagining a post-work world is imagining the social value put on non-work. But you can see hints of how transformative it is even now. In Timothy Ferriss's runaway bestseller <i>The 4-Hour Workweek</i>, he frames his advice as a manual for joining the New Rich. What separates the New Rich from the Old Rich? Mainly that the new rich barely do any work, and they don't much care about money. ""Gold is getting old,"" Ferriss writes. ""The New Rich (NR) are those who abandon the deferred-life plan and create luxury lifestyles in the present using the currency of the New Rich: time and mobility.""</p> \n<p>In other words, rather than working hard now to enjoy a lavish retirement in the future, the New Rich figure out how to retire now and work hard never.</p> \n<p>If all this seems a bit soaked in economic privilege, well, of course it is. The New Rich, in Ferriss's book, outsource much of their work to call centers in India. The extreme early retirement movement that Mr. Money Mustache leads works best for people who have a high-paying job in their 20s and so can sock away hefty savings quickly and then live off the interest.</p> \n<p>But that's actually not the most interesting kind of privilege being employed here. What these efforts suggest is that people who begin with social status can figure out ways to carry that social status into a post-work lifestyle. Saying ""I'm unemployed"" is very different than saying ""I retired at 32, and it's amazing."" The question is, can someone who doesn't start with much social status — Ferriss is a Princeton graduate, Mr. Money Mustache an ex-software engineer — manage the same trick?</p> \n<p>This is one of the questions that will decide whether a post-work world becomes a dystopia. Does whatever replaces work get branded more like unemployment or more like extreme retirement? What happens when you tell someone you just met on Tinder that you don't have a full-time job, but you really love hiking?</p> \n<p>I am not worried that a post-work world can't be a good world. I am just worried that it won't be — that guilt-free early retirement will be a luxury reserved for people who can get good jobs, and denied to people who can't. But there is, in this, some optimism to be found looking backward. As Thompson writes:</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>As late as the mid-19th century, though, the modern concept of ""unemployment"" didn’t exist in the United States. Most people lived on farms, and while paid work came and went, home industry—canning, sewing, carpentry—was a constant. Even in the worst economic panics, people typically found productive things to do. The despondency and helplessness of unemployment were discovered, to the bafflement and dismay of cultural critics, only after factory work became dominant and cities swelled.</p> \n</blockquote>",Business & Finance
"On the Export-Import Bank, the Tea Party is winning",http://www.vox.com/2015/6/24/8838149/export-import-bank-expiration-june-30,And the bank is closing.,"<p>It looks like <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/export-import-bank/what-is-the-export-import-bank"">the Export-Import Bank</a> is really going to close its doors, at least for a while.</p> \n<p>The 80-year-old institution got a reprieve in the fall, when Republicans quietly agreed to extend its charter to June 30. But June 30 is fast approaching, and there's virtually no chance that Congress will vote to save the bank before then.

A new study gives us another reason to celebrate working mothers,http://www.vox.com/2015/6/24/8838383/working-mothers-impact-on-kids,Moms with jobs raise daughters who are more likely to be managers and sons who are more likely to be family caregivers.,"<p>Society constantly tells working mothers to feel bad about the fact that they're spending less time with their kids to bring in additional income. In polls, only <a href=""http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2012/04/13/women-work-and-motherhood/"">21 percent</a> of US adults told pollsters they think the trend toward mothers of young kids having paid jobs is good. But new research shows that a working mother isn't just a necessary evil, it's a positive good.</p> \n<p>A new working paper from Kathleen McGinn, Elizabeth Long Lingo, and Mayra Ruiz Castro at Harvard Business School <a href=""http://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Publication%20Files/15-094_4daac072-cfe4-4943-b446-92338c7b493f.pdf"">finds</a> that having a mother with a job <em>does</em> make a difference to kids when they grow up, and that it's largely change for the better.</p> \n<h3>What are the findings?</h3> \n<p>The researchers find statistically significant differences in outcomes for both boys and girls, though the outcomes are different.</p> \n<ul> \n<li>Daughters of working moms grow up to earn more money, in part because daughters of working moms are more likely to be employed and more likely to be employed in a supervisory role.</li> \n<li>Sons of working moms don't have significantly different economic outcomes, but <em>do</em> grow up to be more likely to spend time taking care of family members or doing household chores. </li> \n</ul> \n<p>In other words, the adult children of mothers who held jobs when they were little kids are likely to grow up as adults who are somewhat less gender-conforming. Their daughters ""lean in"" more in the labor market, and their sons ""lean in"" more at home.</p> \n<h3>What is the evidence?</h3> \n<p>The statistical findings are based on a large cross-national data sample provided by the International Social Survey Programme, supplemented with specific country-level data from a variety of sources. In the end, the researchers were able to aggregate data from more than two dozen countries on a range of continents.</p> \n<p>They then applied statistical controls for basic demographic variables such as age, education, marital status, and  the presence of other children in the house.</p> \n<h3>What conclusions do the researchers draw?</h3> \n<p>The study posits two separate channels through which maternal work influences children's adult outcomes:</p> \n<ol> \n<li>The example of a working mother changes attitudes about gender roles.</li> \n<li>Working mothers directly teach daughters useful job skills.</li> \n</ol> \n<p>To support the first hypothesis, researchers show that ""adult children of employed mothers have significantly more egalitarian gender attitudes"" than adult children of full-time homemakers. This, they think, helps explain why the sons of such mothers do more household work, and partially explains why the daughters of such mothers have more success.</p> \n<p>At the same time, the relationship between mothers' employment and daughters' odds of holding supervisory jobs ""remains strongly significant when gender attitudes are included in the regression."" This leads them to speculate that in addition to shaping gender roles, working moms directly transit ""a set of skills that enable greater participation in the workforce and in leadership positions.""</p> \n<h3>What are the grounds for skepticism?</h3> \n<p>Efforts to study the impact of parenting choices on children's life outcomes tend to founder on the fact that the vast majority of children are close genetic relatives of their mothers.</p> \n<p>The daughters of blue-eyed mothers are significantly more likely to grow up to have blue eyes because blue-eyed mothers pass down genes for blue eyes. By the same token, it is possible that gender attitudes and workplace skills are partially heritable traits, and that accounts for the correlation between maternal behaviors and children's outcomes. To explore the authors' hypothesis in more detail and make them more fully convincing would require studies <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/3/17/8203507/adoption-children-experiences"">specifically focusing on adopted children</a> or on the labor market outcomes of identical vs. non-identical twins.</p> \n<h3>If I want to keep guilting working moms, what should I do?</h3> \n<p>The genetic issue is a good reason to doubt the conclusion of the study, but <em>not</em> a good reason to doubt the basic conclusion that working moms shouldn't feel guilty.</p> \n<p>But if you believe strongly in traditional gender roles, this study doesn't actually provide much reason to change your mind. The conclusion that working mothers help raise patriarchy-subverting children is great news <em>if you want to subvert the patriarchy</em>. But if you don't, it's not great news at all. If your goal in life is to raise kids who conform to traditional gender roles, all this study is saying is that you, personally, should try to conform to traditional gender roles.</p>",Business & Finance

Affordable housing isn't just a problem for poor people any more,http://www.vox.com/2015/6/26/8846761/middle-class-affordability,A Harvard study shows that excessive housing burdens are becoming a problem for the middle class.,"<p>Harvard University's Joint Center for Housing Studies is out with a big new survey on the <a href=""http://www.jchs.harvard.edu/research/state_nations_housing"">state of housing in America in 2015</a>.</p> \n<p>It's full of interesting facts, but this one chart is the best illustration I've seen of an issue that doesn't quite get as much attention as it should — the fact that in some key metropolitan areas, affordable housing has become a problem for the middle class:</p> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""3823970""><img src=""https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3823970/housingchart.png""></div> \n<p>Here's why that matters. Suffering from housing ""cost burden"" is defined in this report (and the affordable housing community writ large) as spending over 30 percent of your income on housing.</p> \n<p>By that standard, it's obviously true that many low-income households struggle to afford housing. And it's also sad. But in an important sense this isn't really a problem that has anything to do with housing specifically.</p> \n<p>If you only earn $15,000 a year, then 30 percent of your annual income is just a really low number. It's hard to afford anything at all when you're poor, and the solution needs to involve either giving poor people subsidies or else enhancing their overall incomes.</p> \n<p>But if you're making $55,000 a year, you're not poor. In fact, your average income is slightly above average for the United States. If non-poor people can't afford something as basic as housing, then that's really a specific issue about housing.</p> \n<p>And what this shows is that while middle-class housing affordability isn't a huge problem in most of the country, it's a very big challenge in the 10 highest-cost metropolitan areas. These are places — <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/6/15/8782235/san-francisco-housing-crisis"">places like the Bay Area</a> and Greater New York City — where people who aren't poor still struggle to afford a decent place to live.</p> \n<p>Those are the places where <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/6/15/8782235/san-francisco-housing-crisis"">anti-development regulations</a> have created a systematic undersupply of market-rate housing, <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/6/15/8782235/san-francisco-housing-crisis"">costing billions in economic damage</a> to the economy as a whole.</p>",Business & Finance
2 ways the latest critique of Piketty misses the mark,http://www.vox.com/2015/6/27/8853865/arnott-bernstein-wu-piketty,"The Forbes 400 can't study multi-generational wealth, for starters.","<p>A new purported debunking of Thomas Piketty's <em>Capital in the 21st Century</em> is out, from <a href=""http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2599827"">Robert D. Arnott, William J. Bernstein, and Lillian J. Wu</a>, and it purports to show that, historically, rich families do not stay rich over time. <a href=""http://reason.com/blog/2015/06/24/piketty-is-wrong-rich-families-dont-gene"">Reason's Ron Bailey</a> and the <a href=""http://www.economist.com/news/finance-and-economics/21654665-future-returns-wealth-will-be-lower-thomas-piketty-thinks-rg-bargy"">Economist's Buttonwood columnist</a> are both very impressed.</p> \n<p>But while I would say they raise some good points about charitable giving and the splitting of inheritances across multiple children, their core methodology is badly flawed. As Buttonwood writes, ""the authors point out that the rapid turnover of the <em>Forbes</em> 400 suggests that inherited wealth is unstable. Three-quarters of the families in the original list no longer appear on it.""</p> \n<h3>The Forbes 400 list can't study multigenerational wealth</h3> \n<p>It's important to understand that the Forbes 400 list is a journalistic undertaking, not a peer-reviewed study of wealth. And it turns out to be a very shaky foundation on which to build academic research.</p> \n<p>As Piketty told me when I asked him about the Forbes list, ""the methodology is biased simply because it's much easier to spot large entrepreneurial wealth than large inherited wealth.""</p> \n<p>Say someone asked you to figure out how rich Steve Ballmer is. I would start by Googling ""Microsoft largest shareholders"" which would quickly reveal that according to <a href=""https://finance.yahoo.com/q/mh?s=MSFT+Major+Holders"">Microsoft's public corporate documents</a> Ballmer owns 333,254,734 shares of Microsoft stock. At the company's current share price of $45.63, that gives him about $15.2 billion worth of Microsoft stock.</p> \n<p>Of course that's going to be an underestimate because he also owns other stuff. The LA Clippers are worth about $2 billion, for example, and we know he owns that because it was a big story when he bought the team. With a little more work, we can probably confirm a few billion more dollars.</p> \n<p>But what if some third-generation rich guy had $15 billion in index funds? How would we find that out? That wouldn't show up on corporate paperwork. And our hypothetical rich guy wouldn't actually be very interesting. He wouldn't be the CEO of any famous companies or sit on the board or do newsworthy things. He'd just be kind of quietly super-rich.</p> \n<h3>Past performance is no guarantee of future results</h3> \n<p>The other big issue with this study is how it deals (or, rather, doesn't deal) with the changing policy environment over time.</p> \n<p>It used to be that the United States had a pretty hefty estate tax. Piketty thinks that was a good idea and that today's environment of much-lower estate taxes will lead to dynastic wealth.</p> \n<p>The authors purport to show that <em>in the past</em> we did not see a huge dynastic wealth problem. And this is exactly what Piketty thinks!

2 paragraphs that explain the Greek financial crisis,http://www.vox.com/2015/6/29/8859741/greek-financial-crisis-euro,"In 1997, economist Milton Friedman predicted that a common currency would be a disaster for the eurozone.","<p data-line-id=""a1a5e10446f86fbc095ba809"">Milton Friedman might be best known today for his free-market political views. But some of his most important contributions to economics were in monetary policy. He explained the high inflation rates of the 1970s, and he was also an early and influential advocate of the system of floating exchange rates that we have today.</p> \n<p data-line-id=""a1a5e10446f86fbc095ba809"">So European policymakers would have done well to pay attention in 1997 when Friedman <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/the-euro--monetary-unity-to-political-disunity"">predicted that the euro would be a disaster</a>. Eighteen years later, with <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/6/17/8793945/greece-important"" target=""_blank"">Greece on the verge of a financial meltdown</a>, his analysis looks prophetic:</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p data-line-id=""a1a5e10446f86fbc095ba809""><span>Europe’s common market exemplifies a situation that is unfavorable to a common currency. It is composed of separate nations, whose residents speak different languages, have different customs, and have far greater loyalty and attachment to their own country than to the common market or to the idea of ""Europe."" Despite being a free trade area, goods move less freely than in the United States, and so does capital.</span></p> \n<p data-line-id=""a1a5e10446f86fbc095ba809""><span></span><span>The European Commission based in Brussels, indeed, spends a small fraction of the total spent by governments in the member countries. They, not the European Union’s bureaucracies, are the important political entities. Moreover, regulation of industrial and employment practices is more extensive than in the United States, and differs far more from country to country than from American state to American state. As a result, wages and prices in Europe are more rigid, and labor less mobile. In those circumstances, flexible exchange rates provide an extremely useful adjustment mechanism.</span></p> \n</blockquote> \n<p data-line-id=""a1a5e10446f86fbc095ca809"">What Friedman means here is that if Greece still had the drachma, it could deal with its financial difficulties by devaluing the currency. A cheaper drachma would make Greek goods more attractive to foreigners, boosting exports and creating jobs. And a bit of inflation in Greece would help ease the country's debt burden — not an ideal outcome, but better than the yearslong depression the country has suffered since the 2008 financial crisis.</p> \n<p data-line-id=""a1a5e10446f86fbc095ca809"">It's much harder for an unemployed man in Greece to move to get a job in Germany than it is for somebody who loses his job in Pennsylvania to find work in Texas. So Greece's unemployment rate has stayed disastrously high, even as other eurozone nations have enjoyed a robust recovery.</p> \n<p data-line-id=""a1a5e10446f86fbc095ca809"">Friedman concluded that the euro experiment would backfire:</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p data-line-id=""a1a5e10446f86fbc095ca809""><span>The drive for the Euro has been motivated by politics not economics. The aim has been to link Germany and France so closely as to make a future European war impossible, and to set the stage for a federal United States of Europe. I believe that adoption of the Euro would have the opposite effect. It would exacerbate political tensions by converting divergent shocks that could have been readily accommodated by exchange rate changes into divisive political issues. Political unity can pave the way for monetary unity. Monetary unity imposed under unfavorable conditions will prove a barrier to the achievement of political unity.</span></p> \n</blockquote> \n<p data-line-id=""a1a5e10446f86fbc095ca809""> </p>",Business & Finance
11 things about the Greek crisis you need to know,http://www.vox.com/2015/6/30/8868363/greece-crisis-default-austerity,"The true origins of the default crisis, the role of austerity, and the path forward.","<p>Greece's long-simmering economic crisis has finally boiled over into a full-fledged political and financial meltdown — banks are closed, Greek citizens' ability to withdraw cash from ATMs is limited, a default on Greece's debts to its fellow European countries looks overwhelmingly likely, and the odds of the country being forced to leave Europe's single currency look very strong.</p> \n<p>Yet for all the drama, Greece itself is a rather small and economically marginal country. Consequently, a lot of the commentary about the Greek crisis sheds less light on the actual situation in Greece than it does on the political opinions of the writer. If you actually want to understand <i>Greece</i>, though, these are the key facts you need to know.</p> \n<h3>1) The Eurozone is a bad idea, economics-wise</h3> \n<p><!-- CHORUS_VIDEO_EMBED ChorusVideo:74350 --></p> \n<p>Before you blame anyone in particular for the disaster unfolding in Greece, it’s important to understand that the underlying concept of the Eurozone is badly flawed. Foreign observers as ideologically varied as <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/6/29/8859741/greek-financial-crisis-euro"">Milton Friedman</a> and <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2015/06/29/krugmans-right-the-euro-was-the-original-mistake-vote-no-for-greek-recovery/"">Paul Krugman</a> have said all along that joining a group of quite distinct European countries into a single currency would end in tears.</p> \n<p>Foreign certainty that the Eurozone was a bad idea was so widespread that back in 2009 before everything collapsed, the European Union produced a mocking paper titled: <a href=""http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/publications/publication_summary16343_en.htm"">""The Euro: It can’t happen. It’s a bad idea. It won’t last. US economists on the EMU, 1989 – 2002.""</a></p> \n<p>The Americans were badly wrong about one of these things — the mere fact that European Monetary Union is a bad idea didn’t stop the EU from doing it, and it hasn’t quite collapsed yet even though it’s caused a lot of suffering.</p> \n<p>The basic problem, however, is quite simple. When a given country's economy falters, one of the easiest ways for it to adjust is for its currency to decline in value relative to other countries' currencies. This reduces the country’s citizens’ real purchasing power — there’s no getting around the bad news — but has the upside of boosting the country’s exports and tourism. In other words, it lets the country respond to an economic crisis by putting people to work making things.</p> \n<p>A country that lacks this flexibility is much more likely to absorb economic pain by entering a prolonged period of mass unemployment. Which is what's happening to Greece now.</p> \n<h3>2) Greece boomed in the early years of the euro</h3> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""3835246""><img src=""https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3835246/greecesocial.png""></div> \n<p>To understand both Greeks’ emotional commitment to the Eurozone and Europe’s stingy attitude toward Greece, it’s important to realize that Greece experienced a wild boom in the early years of European monetary union.</p> \n<p>Before the euro, different countries’ governments paid wildly different interest rates because lenders knew there was a risk of currency devaluation. Greece, in particular, was saddled with high interest rates since its economic policies were held in low esteem and it was widely believed the country would need to resort to devaluations.</p> \n<p>When the euro came into place, those worries vanished — and, wrongly, were not replaced with worries about Greece paying off its debts — which lead to plunging interest rates for Greek bonds. This let both the Greek government and the Greek private sector go on an unsustainable borrowing binge that created extremely rapid debt-fueled growth. In retrospect, both the borrowers and the lenders should have known better but it is what it is.</p> \n<h3>3) The eurozone doesn't treat Greece the way America treats Kentucky</h3> \n<p>Massachusetts has been richer than Kentucky for as long as Kentucky has existed and that shows no sign of changing. California, too, is richer than Idaho. Since the United States of America has a system of taxes and spending that transfers money from rich people to poor people, it also transfers money from rich states to poor states. We could record this history of transfers as a large debt that Kentucky owes to Massachusetts that someday needs to be repaid.</p> \n<p>But we don't. And the government of Massachusetts doesn’t waste its time lecturing the government of Kentucky about the need for Massachusetts-style structural reforms to revive its dysfunctional economy.</p> \n<p>The United States is not unique in this regard. London and the Southeast subsidize northern England. Northern Italy subsidizes southern Italy. Alberta and Ontario subsidize Atlantic Canada. The former West Germany subsidizes the former East Germany. The reason is that once high-value industries are established in particular places, it is very difficult for other regions to fully catch up — New York, London, Frankfurt, Milan, and Toronto all serve as draws for talent from throughout the country and absent ongoing transfer payments back to poorer regions you would see a path of endless divergence.</p> \n<p>To function smoothly, the Eurozone would need to have some of these cross-subsidies. Taxpayers in Germany and the Netherlands would have to commit to subsidizing Greece and Portugal on a constant, ongoing basis without fussing the Greeks and the Portuguese about it too much. <br><br>That German and Dutch voters aren’t excited about this idea is perfectly understandable. That they think it’s reasonable for a currency union to work despite these kinds of transfers is less understandable.</p> \n<h3>4) Greece's debt crisis has been managed terribly</h3> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3835424/greece_graphics2_1024-1.0.png"" alt=""greece_graphics2_1024-1.0.png"" data-chorus-asset-id=""3835424""></p> \n<p>The roots of the current crisis lie in the botched handling of the previous Greek debt default crisis. Irish economist <a href=""https://medium.com/bull-market/greece-the-euro-and-gunboat-diplomacy-3193983d8336"">Karl Whelan has written an excellent overview</a> of this for those who’d like to delve in deeper, but in broad strokes:</p> \n<ul> \n<li>Greece owed a bunch of money to European private banks that it could not pay.</li> \n<li>Rather than have Greece default, and then possibly need to bail out their own banks, European governments gave Greece giant loans so Greece could pay the banks what they owed.</li> \n<li>This left Greece owing foreign governments money that it could not pay, which put Greece in a position of political subservience. </li> \n<li>This succeeded in kicking the can down the road for several years (no small accomplishment) but it didn’t change the fact that Greece lacks the means to pay what it owes and foreign governments lack the means to govern Greece.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>The current crisis is what happens when people stop trying to kick the can down the road. <br><br>The Greek government is demanding that it be able to choose for itself what Greek public policy looks like, and Greece’s European partners are demanding that Greece live up to its commitments if it wants their money.</p> \n<h3>5) Greece's leading political party, Syriza, sold Greek voters on a lie</h3> \n<p>In its successful 2015 electoral campaign, Syriza told the Greek electorate what it wanted to hear: that there was a path out of the nightmare of austerity and external political control into which Greece had fallen that <i>didn’t</i> involve leaving the Eurozone.</p> \n<p>This simply wasn’t true.</p> \n<p>For it to be true, European governments would need to have been willing to write Greece blank checks worth billions of dollars. This isn’t by any means a crazy idea — again, Kentucky gets large, blank checks from Massachusetts because that’s how things work — but it was <i>obviously</i> a non-starter in the Eurozone. The only way to free itself from European shackles has long been for Greece to quit the Eurozone. One suspects that at least <i>some</i> of the movers and shakers in Syriza knew this to be the case, but it was a bad electoral message the party didn't want to send.</p> \n<h3>6) Syriza is marginalized in European politics</h3> \n<p>Syriza is not Greece's traditional left-wing party; it's a different, further-left party that rose to power by displacing the traditional Greek social democrats. Each European country has its own political parties and party system. But, broadly speaking, European parties fall into a few big ""families"" that have similar ideologies and also meaningful cross-national institutional ties.</p> \n<ul> \n<li>In every country, there is a Socialist, Social Democratic, or Labor party that is the largest left-of-center party.</li> \n<li>In every country, there is either a Christian Democratic Party, a ""liberal"" (like a watered-down version of a US libertarian) party, or both comprising the mainstream right. </li> \n<li>In many countries, there is a Green party, ideologically on the left but with a more upscale voting base than the traditional Social Democratic Party.</li> \n<li>In many countries, there is a populist anti-immigrant party, broadly on the right politically, but often operating with the conceit that kicking out immigrants could strengthen the welfare state. </li> \n<li>In many countries, there is a far-left party, often with institutional heritage related to the local Communist Party.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>In present-day Europe, Greece is the <i>only</i> country whose coalition government is led by a far-left party. Indeed, far-left parties have <i>never</i> led a coalition in any other European country. And in a bunch of European countries — including Germany, France, and Spain — the far-left party and the center-left party are not on good terms.</p> \n<p>Consequently, there is a fairly broad sentiment in Europe, including among left-wing parties, that Syriza’s fall from power is something that ought to be welcomed.</p> \n<h3>7) Austerity is a red herring</h3> \n<blockquote lang=""en"" class=""twitter-tweet""> \n<p lang=""en"" dir=""ltr"">""<a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/Greece?src=hash"">#Greece</a> has refused to take the tough steps that the other crisis-ridden countries have taken"". Really? <a href=""http://t.co/5dO7za2Wmt"">pic.twitter.com/5dO7za2Wmt</a></p> \n— Simon Tilford (@SimonTilford) <a href=""https://twitter.com/SimonTilford/status/615479626610159616"">June 29, 2015</a>\n</blockquote> \n<p> \n<script src=""//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"" charset=""utf-8""></script> \n</p> \n<p>You hear a lot about ""austerity"" in the context of the Greek situation. This is in part because Greek fiscal policy has been very austere over the past several years, with the government cutting spending more drastically than any other in Europe. <br><br>But mostly you hear a lot about austerity because austerity was a very real issue in British and American politics during many of the relevant years, and if you read article on the internet in English you find yourself exposed to the preoccupations of Americans and British people.</p> \n<p>In Greece’s case, however, austerity is largely a red herring.</p> \n<p>In the US or the UK, austerity was a choice: financial markets were happy to keep lending the two countries more and more money to cushion their recessions.</p> \n<p>But the Greek government didn't have a choice: it couldn’t run a bigger budget deficit. Nobody would lend them the money! Greece’s European partners have demanded a lot of austerity from the Greek government in exchange for their money, but absent that money Greek fiscal policy would have to be <i>even more austere. </i></p> \n<p>Often, when people criticize the austerity measures in Greece, what they are saying is that Germany and France should have given Greece more money. And maybe they should have! But they didn't, and in the absence of such subsidies, running a more stimulative economic policy wasn't an option for Greece.</p> \n<h3>8) The problem with Germany constantly demanding reforms in Greece</h3> \n<p>The other thing you hear a lot about with regard to Greece is ""structural reform,"" which Greece’s creditors want the country to undertake.</p> \n<p>It’s easy to see from the broad economic aggregates that Greece really would benefit from some kind of reform. Even at its pre-crisis peak, <a href=""https://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&amp;ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=ny_gdp_pcap_cd&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=region&amp;idim=country:GRC:DEU:FIN&amp;ifdim=region&amp;hl=en&amp;dl=en&amp;ind=false"">Greek GDP per capita was much lower than the GDP per capita in Germany or the Netherlands</a>. And <a href=""http://www.theapricity.com/forum/showthread.php?44986-The-most-productive-countries-of-Europe"">Greek labor productivity per hour worked was dismal by European standards</a>.</p> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""3835368""><img src=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3835752/Greece_graphics3.0.png"" alt=""greece_graphics3_v2.png"" data-chorus-asset-id=""3835752""></div> \n<p>The Greek tax collection infrastructure was legendarily ineffective, and the Greek civil service is shot-through with patronage. If Greece managed to achieve the level of governance professionalism and economic performance of the average European country, then Greece’s ability to repay loans would be greatly enhanced.</p> \n<p>But here’s the problem: if Greece managed to achieve the level of governance professionalism and economic performance of the average European country, then this would also be great news for Greek citizens. If there were lots of ideas that would be clearly effective and politically viable, Greek's elected governments would be doing them on their own.</p> \n<p>External pressure and expertise can help with this at the margins, but only at the margins. Greek elites are well-aware of what foreign elites think they should do and ""a bunch of experts from Germany and Finland really think we should do this"" is not really the kind of argument that breaks political logjams. <br><br>Meanwhile, the foreign governments pressing Greece for reform are <i>also</i> political actors. Consequently, outsider demands tend to focus disproportionately on things that are salient in their own domestic politics rather than on game-changing solutions to Greece’s problems.</p> \n<h3>9) It’s in Europe’s interests to make things tough on Greece</h3> \n<p><img style=""line-height: 32.1749992370606px;"" data-chorus-asset-id=""3837826"" alt=""greece_graphic4"" src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3837826/greece_graphics4_1025.0_copy.0.png""></p> \n<p>Greece is an outlier in Europe. But it’s not unique. Lurking behind it are the relatively poor and relatively indebted economies of Portugal and Spain, and arguably even Italy. When Greece stiffs its external creditors and threatens to leave the Eurozone, that makes creditors wonder whether Portugal and Spain and Italy might someday do the same.</p> \n<p>Consequently, it is broadly in Europe’s interest for <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/6/27/8856297/greece-referendum-euro"">whatever Greece does to end up being as messy and painful as possible</a>. Europe needs the message to Portugal to be, ""Wow, that was a disaster, let’s avoid that by any means possible"" not ""Well, that was uncomfortable but it worked out fine in the end.""</p> \n<h3>10) This probably doesn’t matter for you</h3> \n<p>The Greek situation is fascinating, and of course, it’s crucially important to Greek people. But unlike some earlier iterations of European debt drama, it is very unlikely to impact you personally.</p> \n<p>After months (if not years) of highly public wrangling, a Greek default and departure from the Eurozone is completely predictable. Any financial institution that was even slightly paying attention was aware of this possibility, and while the news certainly moves markets there is no reason to think it will spark any kind of panic.</p> \n<h3>11) If you’re vacationing in Greece, you should bring cash</h3> \n<p>The big exception here is if you are planning a vacation to Greece. If that’s the case, the precedent of Argentina (which has been in a somewhat similar situation) suggests that it is probably in your interest to bring a fairly large quantity of paper money (both dollars and euros) into the country since physical currency is likely to be in high demand and the banking system is crippled. Greek individuals will face legal difficulties in turning their money into foreign currency, so opportunities will likely arise to pay for things in paper dollars at a steep discount compared to the official exchange rate.</p> \n<p>If you are considering this vacation, definitely take it.</p> \n<p>The truth is that increased tourism is one of Greece’s best chances for recovery. The country desperately needs foreign buyers and more economic activity, and in the short-term, purchases by tourists attracted by cheap vacations in Greece is one of the best chances for making that happen. Buy stuff to take home. Mail care packages of olives to your friends.</p>",Business & Finance

This would have lowered the value of the drachma in international markets, making Greek exports more competitive. It would also lower domestic interest rates, encouraging domestic investment and making it easier for Greek debtors to service their debts.</p> \n<p>But Greece shares its monetary policy with the rest of Europe.

"The Puerto Rico crisis, explained",http://www.vox.com/2015/7/1/8872553/puerto-rico-crisis,"""I had to make a choice,"" says the governor as he defaults on the island's bonds.","<p>On Monday, Puerto Rico is expected to skip payment on <a href=""http://www.cnbc.com/2016/05/01/puerto-rico-says-will-default-on-government-development-bank-debt-monday.html"">$389 million in debt</a> owed by the island's Government Development Bank to bondholders. Gov. Garcia Padilla of Puerto Rico has been warning for over a year that this government will be unable to fully pay what it owes, and has asked Congress to provide for a structured path to bankruptcy. He didn't get it, largely due to opposition from congressional Republicans, so he is now being forced to resort to unilateral repudiation of debt.</p> \n<p>""Faced with the inability to meet the demands of our creditors and the needs of our people, I had to make a choice,"" he said ""I decided that essential services for the 3.5 million American citizens in Puerto Rico came first.""</p> \n<p>The <a href=""https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/roadmap_for_congressional_action___puerto_rico_final.pdf"">Obama administration</a> and many members of Congress had been pushing to create a bankruptcy process for Puerto Rico that would allow bondholders to recoup some of what they are owed while allowing the island's government to continue functioning. Since Congress has, so far, not acted we are now on the precipice of a much more uncertain and chaotic situation in which Puerto Rico will attempt to selectively cancel debts and bondholders will seek to use the federal courts to block the Puerto Rican government from operating until it pays up.</p> \n<h3>1) What is happening with Puerto Rico?</h3> \n<p>Puerto Rico is an island in the Caribbean Sea that is also a largely self-governing territory of the United States.</p> \n<p>For years, a quirk of US law created a tax subsidy for Puerto Rican debt that encouraged middle class Americans to binge on loaning money to Puerto Rico without really realizing that's what they were doing. The Puerto Rican government took advantage of this situation by borrowing a lot of money, but didn't manage to spend the money that they borrowed to accomplish much that was useful in the long term.</p> \n<p>Then starting in 2006, Puerto Rico was hit with a series of economic misfortunes. At that point, Puerto Rico's strong ties to the United States became a liability because Puerto Rico could not adjust to bad economic times with currency depreciation, but Puerto Rican people could adjust to bad times by moving to the mainland United States.</p> \n<p>That has left Puerto Rico in a 10-year downward spiral of tax hikes, spending cuts, emigration, and higher interest rates. About a year ago, Padilla announced that Puerto Rico is in a ""death spiral"" that he needs to halt, and he began saying that bondholders will not be fully paid. He asked for the creation of a legal bankruptcy process but warned that even absent one the money would not all be paid.</p> \n<h3>2) What is the ""death spiral""?</h3> \n<p>The bad news is that Puerto Rico is really facing two separate death spirals.</p> \n<p>One is the basic death spiral of self-fulfilling default risk. The more money you owe, the more likely it is that you won't be able to pay back all the money that you owe. That means that when your debts come due and you need new loans to pay off the old ones, investors start demanding that you compensate them for their risks in the form of higher interest rates. Those higher interests rates increase the financial burden on your country, and that in turn makes default more likely.</p> \n<p>But the death spiral Garcia was referring to is a second one.</p> \n<p>People generally don't like paying taxes but do enjoy receiving high quality government services. Consequently, a given territory's ability to turn tax revenue into useful services is an important driver of whether people will want to live and do business there. To the extent that your tax revenue is going to pay off old debts, it is not going to provide current services. Thus the more of your budget that you dedicate to debt repayment, the worse the value proposition that you are delivering to your territory's residents and businesses.</p> \n<p>The harder Puerto Rico squeezes, in other words, the more its economy suffers. But the more the Puerto Rican economy suffers, the harder it is for Puerto Rico to pay back its debts. In other words: death spiral.</p> \n<h3>3) How much debt are we talking about?</h3> \n<p>Puerto Rico's total debt outstanding is $72 billion, which is small relative to the overall United States economy but big pretty much any other way you slice it.</p> \n<p>Two US states have more debt than that — California and New York — but Puerto Rico is much smaller, with approximately the population of San Diego County. New York and California are also richer than the average US state whereas Puerto Rico is poorer. Almost all US states have growing populations, but Puerto Rico's is shrinking. In October of 2013, <a href=""http://www.economist.com/news/finance-and-economics/21588364-heavily-indebted-island-weighs-americas-municipal-bond-market-puerto-pobre"">the Economist reported</a> that ""in America’s 50 states the average ratio of state debt to personal income is 3.4%"" whereas the ratings agency Moody's says the comparable figure for Puerto Rico is 89 percent.</p> \n<p>Hawaii, the most indebted US state by this measure, has a 10 percent ratio.</p> \n<p>In other words, Puerto Rico's debts really are way out of line with what any state is financing, and there's no real precedent for paying down debts of this magnitude. There's no real precedent for refusing to pay them either, but default is by no means a crazy option.</p> \n<h3>4) Who lent Puerto Rico all this money? What were they thinking?</h3> \n<p>A large share of the money was initially lent by people not so different from you or me — middle class Americans, especially those living in higher tax states. As for what they were thinking, they probably weren't thinking much of anything in particular.</p> \n<p>They were just putting money away for retirement in municipal bond funds to diversify their portfolios.</p> \n<p>Those funds, in turn, were invested in a diverse array of US public sector bonds. Since Puerto Rican bonds feature some unusual tax advantages, there was an unusually robust level of demand for Puerto Rican debt. Successive Puerto Rican governments responded to demand for their debt in the economically rational way — they borrowed an unusually large amount of money. But none of this lending was driven by particular scrutiny of the details of Puerto Rico's economic situation, and when Puerto Rico's economic fortunes began to change about 10 years ago the dynamics became untenable.</p> \n<p>The flip side of this mindless lending is that Puerto Rico failed to take real advantage of the financial windfall it provided. In theory, loads of cheap debt <em>could</em> have been used to finance incredibly useful public works projects and other social services that laid the foundations for enduring prosperity. But it didn't happen. Instead, Puerto Rico seems to have mostly taken advantage of the opportunity to run a somewhat more generous welfare state than the island could really afford over the long term. Thus when the easy money went away, the country was left with a huge pile of debts rather than a huge pile of enduringly useful infrastructure.</p> \n<h3>5) Is there a number from a classic musical comedy that sums this all up?</h3> \n<p>Not exactly, though ""America"" from the 1957 musical <em>West Side Story</em> does deal with many of the relevant issues — debt, Puerto Rico's relative impoverishment vis-a-vis the United States, the possibility of mass emigration, and the island's oft-misunderstood political relationship with the mainland United States. The recent <em>Glee</em> version tones down the minstrelry relative to the original:</p> \n<p><iframe frameborder=""0"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/EiaqiMDSxCU"" height=""315"" width=""420""></iframe></p> \n<p>But problematic though it may be, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qy6wo2wpT2k"">Rita Moreno's classic 1961 film performance</a> is still worth your time and provides clearer context. A crucial eight-bar musical phrase from the song is replicated in Metallica's ""Don't Tread on Me,"" if heavy metal is more your thing.</p> \n<h3>6) What's this business about Puerto Rican bonds and taxes?</h3> \n<p>All municipal bonds are exempt from federal income taxes. In addition, if you buy municipal bonds issued by the place where you live, those bonds are exempt from state and local income taxes as well. Such bonds are known as triple tax exempt, and they're a big deal for municipal finance and high tax places like New York and California.</p> \n<p>But Puerto Rico's bonds are triple tax exempt regardless of where you live.</p> \n<p>This is not a huge deal for most Americans, but for a high-income person living in a high-tax state it can be a very big deal. And it helped fuel a lot of lending to Puerto Rico that wasn't necessarily thought through in a very serious way.</p> \n<h3>7) What went wrong for Puerto Rico?</h3> \n<p>Starting in 2006, the island has been hit by a series of negative shocks that have undermined its economy and its creditworthiness.</p> \n<p>That was the year that <a href=""http://www.puertoricoreport.com/budget-could-end-dream-of-puerto-rico-tax-advantage-over-foreign-countries/#.VZLTsxNVhBd"">Puerto Rico lost its longstanding federal tax advantages</a> as a location for US companies to do business in. From 1986 to 1996, these took the form of special tax credits (pre-1986 the tax advantage worked differently but had a similar impact) that were rationalized as a way to help Puerto Rico be competitive with developing countries as a manufacturing location, given that Puerto Rico-based firms need to comply with basic US labor rights and safety standards. But starting in 1996 these advantages were placed on a 10-year phase-out schedule and, despite the hopes of Puerto Rican politicians (and tax break hungry business), they were never extended or replaced. That prompted an exodus of businesses from the island from which it has never really recovered.</p> \n<p>After that:</p> \n<ul> \n<li>The 2007 financial crisis made investors suddenly more suspicious of just about everything, including potentially risky Puerto Rican debt.</li> \n<li>The steep recession in 2009 and the slow recovery from the recession hurt Puerto Rico's tourism industry.</li> \n<li>The Tea Party surge in 2010 clarified that a federal bailout of Puerto Rico was politically untenable, and that the risk of default was very real.</li> \n<li> <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/9/19/6117633/detroit-bankruptcy-explained-questions"">Detroit's 2013 bankruptcy</a> went through without causing disastrous shockwaves for the rest of the country, further bolstering the conclusion that Puerto Rico should be left to its own devices. </li> \n</ul> \n<p>A related ongoing development is that in response to Puerto Rico's economic woes, Puerto Rican people have increasingly chosen to leave the island.</p> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""3836766""><img src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3836766/puerto%20rico.png""></div> \n<p>For any given individual, migrating to the mainland makes a lot of sense given the economic conditions on the island. But each person who departs leaves the people who remain with a higher share of old debts to repay. That makes the economic situation even worse and the debt even harder to pay.</p> \n<h3>8) So is Puerto Rico going bankrupt like Detroit did?</h3> \n<p>No. People throw the word bankrupt around a lot, but it actually has a specific technical meaning laid out in the US Bankruptcy Code and other laws. There are a lot of different kinds of bankruptcy, and they all lay out one way or another for a person or organization that cannot pay back its debts to restructure its payments and move forward. The key is that bankruptcy is an organized, rule-governed process designed to bring some clarity to the situation and ideally to resolve it sooner rather than later.</p> \n<p>But US bankruptcy law makes no provision for Puerto Rico (or a US state) to declare bankruptcy. Indeed, what's really special about Puerto Rico is that Puerto Rico's municipalities and municipal corporations — unlike towns, utilities, and school districts in the US mainland — can't declare bankruptcy either.</p> \n<p>Puerto Rico's supporters in the White House, in Congress, and the Treasury Department have been trying to create a bankruptcy process for Puerto Rico, but bondholder organizations have characterized this as a ""bailout"" and blocked action in Congress. So now we get a situation that is going to be a lot more chaotic and generate a lot more revenue for lawyers.</p> \n<p>First, the Puerto Rican government will try to unilaterally decide which bond payments it needs to skip in order to keep the lights running. Then there will be lawsuits — lots of lawsuits — in which various creditors try to force Puerto Rico to pay them ahead of paying Puerto Rico's civil servants, pensioners, social assistance recipients, and other creditors.</p> \n<p>It is relatively unlikely that a federal court based in New York will actually try to dispatch cops to Puerto Rico to physically haul money off. But it's easy to imagine a scenario in which banks based in the mainland are told it's illegal to participate in processing payments of salaries for Puerto Rico's police officers because Puerto Rico's bondholders have not yet been paid.</p> \n<h3>9) Why doesn't Puerto Rico become its own country?</h3> \n<blockquote class=""twitter-tweet""> \n<p dir=""ltr"" lang=""en"">Puerto Rico should be an independent country.</p> \n— Noah Smith (@Noahpinion) <a href=""https://twitter.com/Noahpinion/status/615914511367843840"">June 30, 2015</a>\n</blockquote> \n<p> \n<script charset=""utf-8"" src=""//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js""></script> \n</p> \n<p>To many residents of the mainland United States, separation between the USA and Puerto Rico seems like a natural solution to the island's financial woes as well as the most logical resolution of an anomalous constitutional situation. After all, the empire-building and thirst for military bases that led the United States to take Puerto Rico away from Spain in 1898 are long since obsolete, and Puerto Rico is linguistically, culturally, and economically distinct from the United States.</p> \n<p>What's more, sovereignty could help Puerto Rico in a number of ways. For starters, an independent Puerto Rico would have its own currency and could set monetary policy that is appropriate to Puerto Rican conditions.</p> \n<p>Right now the Federal Reserve does things with little regard for their impact on Puerto Rico, and the value of Puerto Rico's currency (the US dollar) is driven by factors that have nothing to do with Puerto Rico's situation. An independent Puerto Rico could also establish a tax and regulatory framework that is suitable to its status as a middle-income country, rather than subjecting businesses to policies designed for the much richer United States.</p> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""3836928""><img src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3836928/Screen%20Shot%202015-06-30%20at%203.29.41%20PM.png""></div> \n<p>The big problem with this idea is that Puerto Ricans don't want to be independent. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puerto_Rican_status_referendum,_2012"">In a 2012 referendum</a>, a large minority of the population said Puerto Rico should continue with the status quo. Among the 54 percent who desired change in Puerto Rico's constitutional status, 60 percent said Puerto Rico should seek to become a US state. Only 5.5 percent of the 54 percent favored independence.</p> \n<p>There are some practical reasons for this, but the main reason is that Puerto Ricans have been Americans for a long time and just like other Americans feel a strong connection to their country. Most Puerto Ricans have friends and family members living on the US mainland, and many people go back and forth. Consequently, the idea of independence is just a total non-starter. Statehood has more appeal to Puerto Ricans, but would not address any of the factors leading to Puerto Rico's debt problems, and securing a reputation for the island as a deadbeat is unlikely to inspire the mainland United States to become excited about statehood.</p>",Business & Finance

5 charts that show smartphones are taking over the world,http://www.vox.com/2015/7/6/8896329/smartphone-revolution-5-charts,"People are buying more smartphones than they ever bought conventional PCs, and they're using them in new ways too.","<p><span>People are buying vastly more smartphones (and tablets) than they ever bought conventional PCs, and they're using them in new ways that wouldn't have made sense with older computing platforms.</span></p> \n<p><span></span>Benedict Evans, an analyst at the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, recently put together a <a href=""http://ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2015/6/19/presentation-mobile-is-eating-the-world"">presentation</a> on how smartphones are changing our lives. Here are five charts that illustrate the huge impact of these pocket-size devices.</p> \n<h3>1) Sales of smartphones and tablets now dwarf sales of conventional PCs</h3> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""3830858""><img src=""https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3830858/mobile-it-changes-everything-14-638.jpg""></div> \n<p>The PC business is huge. Manufacturers of conventional desktop and laptop computers sold about 300 million units in 2014. But as this chart shows, the market for smartphones and tablets is way bigger. By the end of 2014, consumers were buying 300 million Android and iOS devices <em>per quarter</em>. And unlike the PC business, the mobile device business is still growing.</p> \n<p>This is going to have a big impact on how software is developed in the future. When smartphones were new, people focused on building great desktop or web software and often treated mobile as an afterthought. But the massive popularity of smartphones is forcing software developers to rethink that attitude.</p> \n<h3>2) Microsoft has gone from a dominant force to a niche player</h3> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""3830866""><img src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3830866/mobile-it-changes-everything-17-638.jpg""></div> \n<p>A decade ago, Microsoft dominated the personal computing device market — which Evans defines to include conventional PCs as well as tablets and smartphones. But Microsoft's mobile operating systems haven't caught on with consumers the way Android and iOS have. So as the mobile market has grown, Microsoft has grown less and less significant to the overall personal computing landscape.</p> \n<p>Microsoft will continue to be hugely important in the business world, where Windows PCs are still an industry standard. But the future of the internet belongs to companies like Google, Apple, and Facebook.</p> \n<h3>3) Mobile ads have become hugely important</h3> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""3831312""><img src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3831312/mobile-it-changes-everything-30-638.jpg""></div> \n<p>A few years ago, Facebook (like most internet companies) generated the bulk of its ad revenue from desktop users. But in the past three years, mobile advertising has surged. Today, Facebook's suite of mobile apps generates about twice as much ad revenue as the Facebook website.</p> \n<p>As audiences move to mobile platforms, media and technology companies are going to have to follow them. Companies that stick to a desktop-only strategy will struggle.</p> \n<h3>4) Kids are ditching email and phone calls in favor of mobile messaging</h3> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""3831314""><img src=""https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3831314/mobile-it-changes-everything-38-638.jpg""></div> \n<p>The stereotype of teenage girls spending hours on the phone is obsolete. Today, teenagers in Britain (and, presumably, other rich countries) prefer to communicate using mobile apps. That's very different from British adults, who are still heavy users of the telephone and email.</p> \n<h3>5) Smartphones are destroying the market for digital cameras</h3> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""3831318""><img src=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3831318/mobile-it-changes-everything-40-638.jpg""></div> \n<p>Fifteen years ago, digital cameras revolutionized the photography market, destroying the market for conventional film cameras. But then, after a decade of rapid growth, digital camera sales started to decline sharply. The reason: Everyone now has a smartphone, and their built-in cameras are good enough that most people don't feel a need for a standalone camera.</p> \n<p>The result: We're taking more pictures than ever before, but the quality of these pictures isn't always great. While smartphone cameras have been getting better, there are inherent limits to the quality of photographs you can take with the tiny, non-zoomable lenses you find in smartphone cameras.</p>",Business & Finance

The eurozone's powers-that-be gave Greece their final offer, Greece rejected it, and now the European Central Bank will force Greece out of the eurozone and try to <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/7/5/8890193/greece-referendum-vote-yes"">grind the country into dust</a>.</p> \n<p>But the other possibility is that it was a bluff: The eurozone's powers-that-be wanted to topple Syriza, they saw <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/7/2/8883393/greece-crisis-referendum-explained"">the referendum</a> as a way to do that, and that's why they did everything in their power to persuade the Greek people that voting ""no"" on the deal was akin to voting ""no"" on continued membership in the eurozone. They wanted to scare Greek voters into voting ""yes"" and, in doing so, rejecting Syriza.</p> \n<p>But they failed. The Greek people voted ""no"" anyway. On some level, though, Syriza listened. They <span>got rid of Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis, whom the eurozone's key negotiators loathed (""I shall wear the creditors' loathing with pride,"" Varoufakis </span><a href=""http://bigstory.ap.org/article/81417dc0e14347d5bad14e182cad7cd5/greece-still-cash-starved-after-decisive-no-bailout-vote"">said</a><span> in his resignation). That's something. And if the eurozone's leadership doesn't really want Greece out of the euro, maybe that's enough. Already, Spain's economic minister is </span><a href=""https://twitter.com/reuters/status/617984983219744768"">saying</a><span> Greece should remain in the euro, and should be given a third bailout.</span></p> \n<p><!-- CHORUS_VIDEO_EMBED ChorusVideo:74350 --></p> \n<p>Remember, too, that the eurozone and the Greek government really weren't so far apart on terms. A few days before the referendum, Greece's prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, sent <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/02/business/international/greece-bailout-tsipras.html"">a letter</a> to the European Central Bank, the International Monetary Fund, and the other eurozone countries agreeing to the bulk of a bailout package that Greece had previously rejected. At the time, Tsipras's letter was ignored, as the ECB, IMF, and major eurozone players hoped his government would fall amidst the referendum.</p> \n<p>That hope is now dashed. And so now we'll see what the players' bottom lines really are. Does the eurozone actually want Greece out of the euro? Or did it just want to topple Syriza? And does Greece really want to leave the euro? Or was it just trying to increase its negotiating leverage?</p> \n<p>There's a very good chance that the referendum will leave the situation relatively unchanged: Syriza is still in power, Greece's leverage is no different than it was before the referendum, but neither Greece nor the eurozone really want to go through the pain and uncertainty of a Grexit. I don't think it's out of the question that they end up agreeing on a deal very much like the one they failed to agree on before the referendum.</p> \n<p>We may be very far from the endgame here.</p>",Business & Finance
Greek crisis: 11 people and institutions to blame,http://www.vox.com/2015/7/6/8900659/greek-crisis-blame,There's plenty of blame to go around. Specifically to blame these people.,"<p>Greece and, in a sense, all of Europe are at a point of dramatic crisis. The country has defaulted on its debts, its <a href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/greece-votes-no-banks-will-not-open-monday-and-atm-limits-reduced-2015-7"">banks are closed</a>, and its citizens now face drastic limits on their ability to withdraw money from ATMs or make foreign purchases with credit or debit cards. Exit from the eurozone — an outcome all the relevant parties have loudly insisted for years that they want to avoid — seems likely.</p> \n<p>In the midst of a serious meltdown, what the world needs is forward-thinking solutions, not finger-pointing. But if you're just some random resident of an English-speaking country that has no real say in what happens in the eurozone, then there's really no reason <em>not</em> to play the blame game. The key thing is to play it well.</p> \n<p>Here are 11 culprits — not in any particular order — you can point the finger at.</p> \n<h3>1) The current Greek government</h3> \n<p>Alexis Tsipras and his Syriza party took office in January and were greeted with a good amount of optimism in international circles. After all, their basic critique of the status quo in Greece had a lot of merit. To improve on it, they needed to do two things:</p> \n<ol> \n<li>Persuade Greece-skeptical foreigners that an outsider political party that had no role in <em>creating</em> the mess in Greece was going to be able to deliver on reform in a massive way — so much reform that Greece should be allowed to engage in less austerity</li> \n<li>Form a broad front with the Social Democratic politicians who lead the governments of France and Italy and play key roles in coalitions in Germany and the Netherlands to shift Europe's <em>overall</em> strategy to one more focused on creating adequate aggregate demand rather than cutting wages</li> \n</ol> \n<p>They delivered on neither of these things, instead alienating all potential partners with  <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/mar/23/tsipras-raises-nazi-war-reparations-claim-at-berlin-press-conference-with-merkel"">irresponsible rhetoric about Nazis</a> and unreasonable demands that the main left-of-center parties elsewhere in Europe wouldn't endorse.</p> \n<h3>2) Europe's private banks</h3> \n<p>Right now Greece owes money to a variety of European countries and government institutions. But Greece originally got into such a terrible debt situation because it was borrowing money on private financial markets.</p> \n<p>Had private banks and bond purchasers correctly processed Greece's likely ability to pay back so much money, Greece would have been unable to become so severely indebted. That would not leave it without economic problems. Spain, which ran a very prudent fiscal policy during the bubble years, has nonetheless been in big trouble since the crash. But Spain is still far better off than Greece.</p> \n<p>Assessing credit risk is the primary job of a lender, and the people who loaned the money to Greece did an awful job of it.</p> \n<h3>3) The European Central Bank</h3> \n<p>The proximate cause of the current crisis is that the <a href=""https://medium.com/bull-market/whats-going-on-with-the-ecb-and-greece-3821de717625"">European Central Bank decided in February</a> to proclaim that if Greece could not come to terms with its creditors, there would be consequences for the Greek banking system.</p> \n<p>It is not entirely clear <em>why</em> the ECB did this, but it was a matter of its discretion, not a move forced by any aspect of European law. As Karl Whelan of University College Dublin writes, ""The ECB can single out specific institutions and decide to not lend to them for pretty much whatever 'risk-related' reason they feel like putting forward"" with the decision not ""based on any hard and fast rules.""</p> \n<p>The stakes in a default — Greece cut off from international financing and forced to engage in even more austerity — were already high, but the ECB raised them dramatically when it could have been lowering the temperature.</p> \n<h3>4) European policymakers circa 2010</h3> \n<p>With Greece facing insolvency five years ago, the people running Europe came up with a deeply unsatisfying solution. Rather than default on its debts to private creditors, Greece would be given money by its European partners to pay them off. But the debt would not actually be forgiven. It would simply be <em>transferred</em> to the European Central Bank, the International Monetary Fund, and a passel of other European states.</p> \n<p>This succeeded in kicking the can down the road, but the fact remained that <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/7/2/8883307/merkel-nsa-wikileaks-greek-crisis"">Greece could not pay what it owed</a>.</p> \n<p>It probably wouldn't have been possible to put together a comprehensive solution in the heat of the crisis. But the Euro policy elite never publicly admitted to their own electorates that what they'd thrown together wasn't viable in the long term. That ended up poisoning the political wells and making Greek requests to revisit the terms of the arrangement look much less reasonable than they really were.</p> \n<h3>5) The IMF</h3> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""3847138""><img src=""https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3847138/greece%20forecasts.png""></div> \n<p>The various European politicians making decisions for Greece kept relying on economic forecasts, primarily done by the International Monetary Fund, that were <em>wildly</em> too optimistic about the extent of the collapse that was being forced on the Greek economy.</p> \n<p>Had policymakers back in December 2010 known that they were choosing something closer to the yellow line than the red line, they might not have chosen it.</p> \n<h3>6) The Obama administration</h3> \n<p>Nah ... not really. The Greek debt crisis really stands out among world crises in that nobody is blaming the United States of America for it and it pretty clearly isn't the US's fault. <a href=""https://next.ft.com/3101c64a-2178-11e5-aa5a-398b2169cf79"" target=""_blank"">Ed Luce at the Financial Times makes a strong effort at a ""blame America"" column</a>, but he's ultimately forced to agree that the US role has been largely constructive, just not especially significant.</p> \n<p>We do have our own <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/7/1/8872553/puerto-rico-crisis"">debt crisis unfolding in Puerto Rico</a>, though, so there's that.</p> \n<h3>7) Angela Merkel</h3> \n<p>The German chancellor's defenders will tell you, not unreasonably, that she has a domestic electorate that she needs to answer to. They will tell you, not unreasonably, that German voters would rather see their hard-earned tax dollars go to German citizens or to citizens of truly poor countries around the world and not to middle-income Greece. Lastly, they will tell you, also not unreasonably, that most living Germans experienced the massive financial expenditures associated with German reunification and the big lesson they learned was that all the government spending in the world hasn't closed the economic gap between East and West.</p> \n<p>This is all very true, and those who ignore it are making a serious mistake.</p> \n<p>That said, Harry Truman faced domestic political constraints when he orchestrated the Marshall Plan. George Washington faced domestic political constraints when he passed the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compromise_of_1790"">Compromise of 1790</a>. The British and French leaders who agreed to participate in the <a href=""http://cadtm.org/The-Marshall-Plan-and-the-Debt"">1953 cancellation of German debts</a> faced political constraints. At times of crisis, great leaders manage to elevate the needs of statecraft beyond short-term interests and recognize the <em>larger</em> interest that major countries have in stabilizing situations and creating conditions conducive to global growth.</p> \n<p>Germany is the largest economy in Europe (by far), and if anyone is going to play a leadership role, it is going to be Germany. But leadership is always moderately costly, and under Merkel, Germany has been unwilling to pay that price choosing instead to conduct itself like a small, narrowly mercantilist state.</p> \n<h3>8) Finland (and the Netherlands and Austria)</h3> \n<p>The Eurozone's small creditor nations (especially the Netherlands, Finland, and Austria) have a small-state mentality for good reason — they really are small.</p> \n<p>And small countries have a distinctive outlook on macroeconomic affairs. Fiscal stimulus doesn't work very well because you are so engaged in international trade that there is massive ""leakage"" across borders. Similarly, monetary policy has its effect largely through exchange rates and international trade rather than domestic investment. And because you are small, your domestic economic policies don't have a big impact on the global economy. Because you are small, your foreign policy lacks grand ambitions and largely exists as an extension of economic growth policy.</p> \n<p>This small-state outlook is harmless in a Norway or a New Zealand, but even though Finland really is small, when Finnish politicians speak on Eurozone policy they are influencing economic policy for the <em>largest</em> economic bloc in the world. Fiscal policy matters a lot for Europe as a whole, European monetary policy acts primarily on domestic investment, and the state of the European economy is very significant for global growth. Failure to appreciate these facts has been a consistent drag on continent-wide growth and has exacerbated Europe's problems.</p> \n<h3>9) Helmut Kohl and François Mitterand</h3> \n<!-- CHORUS_VIDEO_EMBED ChorusVideo:74364 --> \n<p>The former leaders of Germany and France, respectively, have long since departed the scene. But they bear substantial blame for the eurozone's badly flawed design.</p> \n<p>Operating in the context of imminent German reunification, Mitterand desperately wanted a ""win"" for French foreign policy, and Kohl wanted a reassuring gesture that would induce Germany's neighbors to accept reunification. What they came up with was a huge symbolic deepening of the project of European integration, including the creation of a single currency. Important questions like ""What will we do if a member of the currency zone faces a severe depression"" were simply not answered by the eurozone's architects. They were practicing high geopolitics and were focused on making a very ambitious vision acceptable to the relevant domestic political constituencies.</p> \n<p>They got what they wanted, but Europe's economies have been paying the price ever since.</p> \n<h3>10) Greece's other political parties</h3> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""3848144""><img src=""https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3848144/greece_graphics3_1024-1.png""></div> \n<p>Syriza has made a hash of things since taking office in January. But if you look at the available alternatives, it is very easy to see why Greek voters turned to Tsipras and his team. The previous government, after all, was simply a grand coalition between the two main parties — New Democracy on the right and PASOK on the left — which had landed Greece in the mess in the first place.</p> \n<p>Those were the parties who'd gotten Greece so deeply in debt, those were the parties who'd set up Europe's least effective tax collection system, and those were the parties who'd created the bad economic policies they were now claiming to be ""reforming.""</p> \n<p>Combine all that with a 25 percent unemployment rate, and <em>of course</em> the opposition won the election. Besides Syriza, the opposition included the Communist Party and a neo-fascist party called Golden Dawn. Who would you have voted for?</p> \n<h3>11) Europe's Social Democrats</h3> \n<p>The policies favored by the European right — austerity budgets and business-friendly labor market deregulation — have not been a striking success over the past five years. But the main alternative to the European right — the continent's various social democratic or labor parties — has completely failed to put forward any kind of compelling alternative.</p> \n<p>In particular, many people hoped that the election of François Hollande as president of France in 2012 would provoke a rethinking of the policies associated with the Merkel-Sarkozy Franco-German duo that had been at the heart of earlier European policymaking. When the 2013 German parliamentary elections forced Merkel to abandon her right-wing coalition partner in favor of a coalition with Germany's Social Democrats, the opportunity for a center-left perspective on European affairs to gain steam only grew.</p> \n<p>But nothing happened.</p> \n<p>Europe's Social Democrats haven't espoused an alternative Keynesian or monetarist set of solutions for Europe's economic woes, they haven't put forward any innovative debt relief schemes, <em>and</em> they haven't come up with an alternative to the European right's vision of structural reform. Instead they've mostly argued for a form of austerity that involves a bit more tax hikes on the rich and a bit less cuts in old-age pensions.</p>",Business & Finance

How Greece leaving the euro would actually work,http://www.vox.com/2015/7/6/8901303/greek-crisis-grexit-how-it-works,Either a bunch of IOUs or a week-long bank holiday would be the first step.,"<p>Greece has two big problems right now. One is that the Greek state is running out of euros, which it needs to pay its employees and social assistance recipients. The other is that the Greek people think Greece's banks will fail and have been pulling their euros out of the Greek banking system. The two problems lock together in a kind of deadly circle: With banks unable to operate normally, the economic activity is strangled, and with economic activity strangled, tax collections are plummeting — leaving the Greek state's coffers even emptier than before.</p> \n<p>The most likely solutions involve either the introduction of a parallel currency, Greece leaving the eurozone, or Greece somehow managing to finagle some more money out of its European partners.</p> \n<p>Here's what those three options would look like.</p> \n<h3>1) Parallel currency/IOUs/Scrip</h3> \n<p>One option would be to borrow an idea from California, which in 2009 ran out of dollars and instead <a href=""http://money.cnn.com/2009/07/02/news/economy/California_IOUs/"">paid many state bills with IOUs</a>. Instead of actual money, various county agencies, small businesses, and tax refund recipients were given legal tokens through which California acknowledged that it was legally obligated to pay.</p> \n<p>Of course, you can't take an IOU to the store and buy bread. But maybe you could take €100 worth of IOUs to a guy who wasn't urgently in need of bread and trade them for €98. In this sense, Greek IOUs could begin to circulate as a kind of ""parallel"" currency even while the euro remained the country's currency of record. Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis seemed to be suggesting something along these lines over the weekend, and <a href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/report-yanis-varoufakis-got-kicked-out-for-saying-greece-could-introduce-a-parallel-currency-2015-7"">got himself fired</a> for talking out of turn.</p> \n<p>This was a great solution for California, because the reason California was running out of money was political gridlock between then–Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger and the Democratic-controlled state legislature. Nobody was actually talking about <em>not</em> paying what was owed; they were just disagreeing about <em>how</em>. Once the deadlock was resolved, dollars became available, and the IOUs were redeemed.</p> \n<p>The problem for Greece is that people will worry that Greek government IOUs will either not be paid at all, paid at a discount to their face value, or paid in new drachma (or some other hypothetical currency) rather than in euros. Consequently, people are unlikely to give you €98 for a €100 IOU. Maybe you could get €70? Maybe only €40? Nobody really knows.</p> \n<h3>2) New drachma</h3> \n<p>Unlike California, Greece is a sovereign state. If it has bills it needs to pay, it could do what the vast majority of countries around the world do — print its own currency. In Greece's case we'll call the new currency the new drachma, after Greece's old currency.</p> \n<p>Of course, it takes time to physically print money. But an electronic switchover can be done faster. It would look something like this:</p> \n<ul> \n<li>Order banks to close for several days so they can reprogram their computers.</li> \n<li>Pass a law redenominating every Greek financial asset, wage and price contract, social assistance benefit, and other commercial transaction subject to Greek law from euros into drachmas. Yesterday's 100 euros will be tomorrow's 100 new drachmas.</li> \n<li>Begin collecting taxes in new drachmas, to ensure that the currency has some value to Greek people.</li> \n<li>Let people keep using euro coins and bills for everyday transactions, recognizing that €100 euros will probably buy you <em>way</em> more than 100 new drachmas' worth of stuff.</li> \n<li>Start the process of printing physical new drachmas to be introduced several months down the road.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>As with the IOUs, it's an open question what value the market would place on a new drachma. But unlike with IOUs, a formal currency could be traded on international markets rather than informally in storefronts, so price discovery would happen relatively quickly.</p> \n<h3>3) Bailout</h3> \n<p>Last but by no means least, Greece is still trying to reach a deal with its creditors that would allow it to avoid either scenario — Greece would agree to a package of structural reforms and fiscal austerity measures, and in exchange would get a bunch of euros from European governments and robust support for its banks from the European Central Bank.</p> \n<p>Given that exactly such a package was rejected by the Greek government last week and then rejected again by the Greek voters in a weekend referendum, the path to a deal looks very murky. Now, on top of all the other issues to be negotiated, there is a major lack of trust between the Greek government and other European countries. But as of yet, everyone's official position is that negotiations are still ongoing and they are searching for a way to keep Greece from needing to resort to these other options.</p>",Business & Finance
A Greece crisis take that's actually optimistic and somewhat persuasive,http://www.vox.com/2015/7/6/8901595/karl-whelan-grexit-optimism,Irish economist Karl Whelan explains why things could still work out fine.,"<p>If you are looking for an argument that the Greek ""no"" vote on this weekend's referendum doesn't mean Greece will end up leaving the eurozone, you won't do better than to read these tweets from <a href=""https://twitter.com/whelankarl"">Irish economist Karl Whelan</a>.</p> \n<p>The basic case is pretty simple: Getting some financial assistance from Europe is better for Greece than getting no assistance, and getting some debts repaid is better for Europe than getting no debts repaid.

This means that relative to other European countries, labor costs are now low and it is a relatively cheap place to operate labor-intensive hospitality businesses like restaurants and nice hotels. Meanwhile, reports are arriving that many international visitors are responding to negative headlines by <a href=""http://www.afr.com/news/world/europe/greece-debt-crisis--islands-hurting-as-tourism-sector-enters-troubled-waters-20150706-gi5tct"">canceling trips to Greece</a>, meaning that even better deals may be emerging as bookings decline.</p> \n<h3>Grexit will make Greece even cheaper</h3> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""3850774""><img src=""https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3850774/greece_graphics4_1025.0_copy.0.png""></div> \n<p>If Greece <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/7/6/8901303/greek-crisis-grexit-how-it-works"" target=""_blank"">ends up leaving the eurozone</a>, <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/7/5/8895197/greece-referendum-results"" target=""_blank"">as seems likely</a>, the value of its new currency will fall rapidly relative to the euro and the dollar. A sharp currency devaluation in an economically healthy country would merely lead to higher wages as workers struggle to recoup their bargaining power.</p> \n<p>But with a quarter of Greeks unemployed, very few workers will have the bargaining power to secure those wage concessions. What will happen instead is the real take-home pay of Greek workers will fall, turning Greece into a land of even greater bargains. That should increase the level of business activity in Greece and begin to reduce the joblessness rate. When that happens, wages will rise again. But in the transition period, Greece is going to go from being a <em>good</em> bargain to being a <em>great</em> bargain.</p> \n<h3>Bring cash to Greece</h3> \n<p>If you were to arrive in Greece tomorrow, you would find a country whose banks are closed and where there are sharp restrictions on one's ability to withdraw money from an ATM. A foreign credit card should still work fine, but the smarter move is bring cash into the country.</p> \n<p>That's because if Greece leaves the eurozone, a Greek person's €1,000 bank account is soon going to be worth less than €1,000. By contrast, a stack of paper euro notes can always be stashed in a kitchen cabinet and will retain its face value. Consequently, the rational Greek person will prefer €1,000 in cash to €1,000 in a bank account. This is exactly why Greek officials have limited ATM withdrawals — they know everyone would scramble to get the cash out if they could. If you bring cash with you into the country, you <em>ought</em> to be able to get bargains if you are willing to pay in cash.</p> \n<p>If your trip is scheduled for the future — after Greece has introduced its own currency — you should still plan to bring cash.</p> \n<p>One very frequent scenario for a country that has recently depreciated its currency is to take legal steps to try to prevent its people from taking their wealth out of the country. This tends to create a situation where the ""official"" exchange rate that banks and credit card companies are forced to use is considerably less favorable to foreigners than the black market exchange rate. Any tourist visiting Argentina these days is well advised to bring plenty of US dollars in cash and use them to buy pesos on the black market rather than using credit cards. Greece is probably going to be in the same boat soon.</p> \n<h3>WATCH: How the Euro caused the Greece crisis</h3> \n<!--  ########  BEGIN VOLUME VIDEO  ########  --> \n<div class=""volume-video"" id=""volume-placement-4783"" data-volume-placement=""article"" data-analytics-placement=""entry:middle"" data-volume-id=""3285"" data-volume-uuid=""52e4fcc8b"" data-analytics-label=""How the euro caused the Greek crisis  | 3285"" data-analytics-action=""volume:view:entry:middle"" data-analytics-viewport=""video""></div> \n<!--  ########  END VOLUME VIDEO  ########  --> \n<h3>Going to Greece is the right thing to do</h3> \n<p>I have heard some concern that it might be immoral to take advantage of a country's economic misfortune by planning a vacation.

"The Puerto Rico crisis, explained in fewer than 500 words",http://www.vox.com/2015/7/7/8908331/puerto-rico-economy,"The island's economy is being crushed by a vicious cycle of debt, emigration, recession, and austerity.","<p>Puerto Rico and its various public corporations are saddled with debts that the island's governor, Alejandro García Padilla, says are ""not payable"" and lock them into a ""death spiral"" from which only some form of non-payment can allow them to escape.</p> \n<p>The crisis originates in some of the many special rules that apply to the island. One makes bonds sold by Puerto Rico and its sub-units exempt from state, local, and federal taxation. That helped Puerto Rico borrow a lot of money in the 1990s and 2000s. But in 2006, Puerto Rico lost a different tax preference that subsidized its manufacturing, and it entered a recession. Then the Great Recession of 2008 hurt Puerto Rican tourism.</p> \n<p><!--  ########  BEGIN SNIPPET  ########  --></p> \n<div data-analytics-category=""article"" data-analytics-action=""link:related"" class=""chorus-snippet s-related"">\n<span class=""s-related__title"">Related</span> <!-- Add links here --><a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/7/1/8872553/puerto-rico-crisis"">Our longer Puerto Rico economy explainer</a><br><!-- End links -->\n</div> \n<!--  ########  END SNIPPET  ########  --> \n<p><span>Those recessions started to make it difficult for Puerto Rico to pay the interest on its old loans. It needed higher taxes and cutbacks in government services to make it work.</span></p> \n<p>The austerity budgets further damaged the Puerto Rican economy and encouraged Puerto Ricans to migrate to the mainland United States. Consequently, Puerto Rico's population has been steadily falling for years. Each person who leaves increases the amount of debt that each remaining person has to pay. And the tighter each Puerto Rican is squeezed by debt service payments, the more the economy suffers and emigration is encouraged.</p> \n<p>And it gets worse. Puerto Rico, like a US state, has no legal mechanism to file for bankruptcy. But unlike a US state, there is also no legal mechanism for Puerto Rican towns, utilities, and other government entities to declare bankruptcy. Puerto Rico's governor says the debts can't be fully repaid and need to be restructured to give the island's economy a chance to recover, but he has no legal power to make that happen. If Puerto Rico doesn't pay what it owes, its creditors can sue and get federal courts to order bondholders be paid ahead of police, firefighters, pensioners, and other public services.</p> \n<p><a style=""font-family: Balto, Helvetica, Arial, 'Nimbus Sans L', sans-serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.65;"" href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/7/7/8906515/hillary-clinton-puerto-rico-bankruptcy"" target=""_blank"">Hillary Clinton</a>, Jeb Bush, and Martin O'Malley have all come out in favor of changing the bankruptcy code to let Puerto Rican municipalities file for Chapter 9 bankruptcy, but congressional Republicans deem this a ""bailout"" and won't agree.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, with or without debt relief, Puerto Rico desperately needs a return to economic growth. But many aspects of federal policy disadvantage the island. Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rates are lower than on the mainland, which encourages doctors to emigrate. But the federal minimum wage applies, even though Puerto Rico is much poorer than the mainland. A federal shipping regulation called the Jones Act makes Puerto Rico's cost of living higher than that of similar islands, and federal welfare programs are not well designed for Puerto Rican conditions. Only Congress can fix this set of problems, but Puerto Rico isn't represented in the US Congress. And with some form of default looking likely, hedge funds that specialized in distressed debt are buying the island's bonds — and their interests certainly are represented on Capitol Hill.</p>",Business & Finance

Why rental car insurance is usually a rip-off,http://www.vox.com/2015/7/8/8911279/rental-car-insurance,Read this before you sign on the dotted line.,"<p>If you've ever rented a car, you've probably been pressured to buy insurance. A salesperson will inevitably urge you to pay a little extra for what seems like lot of protection. He or she might keep offering you alternative plans if you decline — and as you stand there, uncertain of your coverage and fearful of calamity, it might feel like the prudent, adult move to simply say yes.</p> \n<p>It isn't.</p> \n<p>What the salesperson doesn't tell you is that most drivers won't actually benefit much from their insurance. In some instances, buying it from the rental company will even nullify certain types of existing coverage, leaving you with no more protection than if you'd opted out in the first place.</p> \n<p>Insurance is a very profitable add-on, and these agents <a href=""http://www.edmunds.com/car-buying/confessions-of-a-rental-car-agent.html"">sell it on commission</a> — but in most cases, you probably don't need to get it.</p> \n<h3>Don't get either type of insurance if you have your own car</h3> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3854570/shutterstock_228621505.0.jpg"" alt=""car"" data-chorus-asset-id=""3854570""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">(Shutterstock)</p> \n<p>To figure out what to get, it's helpful to distinguish between the two main types of insurance rental companies will try to sell you:</p> \n<ul> \n<li> <strong>Loss damage waiver</strong> (LDW), which covers any damage you might cause to the vehicle and usually costs $10 to $20 per day</li> \n<li> <strong>Liability insurance</strong>, which covers damage to other people and cars you cause with the vehicle and generally costs $5 to $15 per day</li> \n</ul> \n<p>If you have your own car — and thus your own insurance plan — you probably have both of these forms of protection already. They're built into most<strong> </strong>plans, the vast majority of which <a href=""https://www.esurance.com/info/car/myth-rental-car-coverage-is-always-necessary"">extend to cover</a> rental cars.</p> \n<p>Of course, there are some exceptions. A slim minority of people just have the legally mandated <a href=""https://www.allstate.com/tools-and-resources/car-insurance/liability-car-insurance-cover.aspx"">liability insurance</a> but not the optional <a href=""http://www.valuepenguin.com/collision-comprehensive-car-insurance"">collision or comprehensive insurance</a> (which is analogous to the LDW). Or you might have a collision plan with a very high <a href=""http://www.21st.com/auto-insurance-information/understanding-car-insurance-deductibles.htm"">deductible</a> (meaning you have to pay a lot of money toward a repair before the insurance company starts pitching in). If either of these are the case, you might want to consider adding some insurance from the rental agency.</p> \n<p>But the bottom line is that if you have your own car, take a good look at your own insurance plan before you get to the rental counter. It'll probably cover you just as well as what they'll try to sell you.</p> \n<h3>Most credit cards give you some coverage</h3> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3854572/shutterstock_168902270.0.jpg"" alt=""credit cards"" data-chorus-asset-id=""3854572""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">(Shutterstock)</p> \n<p>Even if you don't have a car, most credit card companies automatically offer collision insurance for vehicles rented with their cards. This is roughly analogous to the LDW discussed above.</p> \n<p>But this is usually ""secondary"" insurance, which means it's only good if there are otherwise gaps in coverage. In other words, this insurance only kicks in if you <em>don't </em>buy an LDW from the rental car agency.</p> \n<p>All this <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/george-hobica/everything-you-need-to-kn_b_3577103.html"">can vary</a> from card to card — so look closely at the fine print of your credit card agreement (or call the company) to see if you're covered. But in general, <a href=""http://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/credit-card-benefits/rental-car-insurance/"">the following cards</a> offer secondary collision insurance for rental cars:</p> \n<ul> \n<li>All Visa cards</li> \n<li>All American Express cards</li> \n<li>Platinum, Gold, World, and World Elite MasterCards</li> \n<li>Some Discover cards</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Again, there are some exceptions, and you have to be careful. Most of these cards only cover rentals made in the US, and they might only cover cars rented for <a href=""http://thepointsguy.com/2013/03/maximize-monday-choosing-the-best-credit-card-for-car-rental-insurance/"">two weeks or less</a>.</p> \n<h3>If you don't own a car, you probably want liability insurance</h3> \n<p>Most credit cards, however, don't offer any sort of liability insurance (the kind that covers damage to other people and cars). Rental companies are <a href=""http://www.consumeraffairs.com/travel/carrent_ins.html"">legally obligated</a> to provide a minimum baseline level of liability coverage for no extra fee, but it's very low — only covering up to <a href=""http://www.iii.org/automobile-financial-responsibility-limits-and-enforcement-by-state"">$50,000 or so</a> in damages in most states.</p> \n<p>In essence, this means that if you cause a serious accident that leads to other drivers' and passengers' medical bills greater than this amount, you'll have to pay the remainder. And that remainder could theoretically be astronomically huge.</p> \n<p>So if you don't own a car — and thus don't have your own liability plan — opting to pay for the rental agencies' extra liability coverage<strong> </strong>is a very good idea. Alternatively, you can buy a <a href=""http://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/insurance/car-insurance-basics/nonowner-car-insurance/"">non-driver liability coverage</a> plan from Geico, Progressive, and a few other companies if you frequently rent or borrow cars.</p> \n<h3>There are two other types of insurance — and you probably don't need them, either</h3> \n<p>Rental agencies also offer two other, cheaper types of insurance:</p> \n<ul> \n<li> <strong>Personal accident insurance</strong>, which covers your medical costs in the event of an accident and usually costs less than $5 per day</li> \n<li> <strong>Personal effects protection</strong>, which covers the theft of any of your possessions you might have in the vehicle and usually costs less than $5 per day</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Both of these are usually much cheaper than the first two types of insurance offered, but for most people they're not necessary.</p> \n<p>If you have health insurance — which has been <a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/individual-mandate/what-is-individual-mandate"">legally required</a> of almost all US citizens since 2014 — you likely have coverage of your own medical costs that's <a href=""http://www.iii.org/article/rental-car-insurance"">just as substantial</a> as what the rental car company is trying to sell you, if not more so.</p> \n<p>If you have homeowners or renters insurance, meanwhile, your possessions will typically be covered from theft whether they're at home or on the road with you. If you don't have either of these types of insurance and are traveling with especially expensive items, however, then this insurance might be worthwhile.</p> \n<h3>Why rental agents push so hard for you to buy insurance</h3> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3854574/GettyImages-75318927.0.jpg"" alt=""rental car"" data-chorus-asset-id=""3854574""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">(Joe Raedle/Getty Images)</p> \n<p>There's one basic reason, even though the majority of renters don't need it: Insurance is a high-margin item.</p> \n<p>Like prepaid gas, luxury vehicles, GPS navigators, and other sorts of upsells, insurance is responsible for a disproportionate amount of the rental agency's profits. The insurance policies cost rental companies little, and the added daily fees can substantially increase your bill. On the other hand, if you decline insurance (and rent a compact car and pump your own gas before returning), their costs aren't a whole lot lower, but your bill is reduced dramatically.</p> \n<p>As an anonymous Los Angeles rental car agent wrote in a <a href=""http://www.edmunds.com/car-buying/confessions-of-a-rental-car-agent.html"">""confession"" for the auto website Edmunds.com</a>:</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>Selling products above and beyond the car was essential for survival in the business. If someone walks out with a killer deal, takes the cheapest car, takes no ""protection,"" which is their term for insurance, takes none of the other products we offer — it reflects poorly on me and ruins my likelihood of promotion.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<hr> \n<h3>RELATED: Why expensive wine is a rip-off</h3> \n<!--  ########  BEGIN VOLUME VIDEO  ########  --> \n<div class=""volume-video"" id=""volume-placement-6089"" data-volume-placement=""article"" data-analytics-placement=""entry:middle"" data-volume-id=""2422"" data-volume-uuid=""c2f5fb24a"" data-analytics-label=""Expensive wine is for suckers | 2422"" data-analytics-action=""volume:view:entry:middle"" data-analytics-viewport=""video""></div> \n<!--  ########  END VOLUME VIDEO  ########  -->",Business & Finance

What the 1990 Japanese stock market crash can teach us about today's Chinese crash,http://www.vox.com/2015/7/9/8915995/china-stock-market-crash-nikkei,The last time the world's No. 2 economy had an epic market meltdown.,"<p>A large Asian economy experiences a couple of decades of supercharged growth, overtakes Germany as the world's biggest exporter, and becomes the world's  second-largest economy, powered by a large manufacturing sector and a large trade surplus (though dogged by accusations of current manipulation). Americans worry they are falling behind, and marvel at the country's soaring stock market. But then it soars suspiciously high, before crashing into the ground,</p> \n<p>Sound familiar? I'm referring, of course, to the great crash of Japan's Nikkei 225 index over the course of 1990. Looking at that historical episode helps put the ongoing <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/7/8/8913885/china-stock-market-news"">Chinese stock market crash</a> in context.</p> \n<h3>Japan suffered massively, but America was fine</h3> \n<p>After reaching a peak of  38,916 points in late 1989, the main Japanese stock market began to plunge. <a href=""http://www.aei.org/publication/two-decades-later-nikkei-and-lessons-from-the-fall/"">As Vaclav Smil recalls</a>, ""The index was below 25,000 by November 1990 (losing nearly 40 percent in 1990); the first dip below 20,000 came in March 1992; the 15,000 level was broken in June 1995; and the first slip below 10,000 came in September 2001.""</p> \n<p>This was tied in with a genuinely bad economic situation in <a href=""http://www.nber.org/papers/w12142"">Japan, which suffered a ""lost decade""</a> of essentially zero economic growth across the 1990s. But suppose you were an American sitting around in 1990 dialing in to CompuServe to check out the latest carnage in the Asian financial markets and worrying about your family and your country. Well ... it turns out that an epic economic collapse in a giant Asian economy isn't necessarily a huge problem for the United States.</p> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""3855754""><img src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3855754/usjapan.jpg""></div> \n<p>In fact, while Japan was stagnating, the United States had its best decade since the 1960s. Japan started growing again (on a per capita basis) in the 2000s, but the US has never again enjoyed growth as robust as what happened while Japan melted down.</p> \n<p>All of which is to say that even if the Chinese stock market crash proves to be a harbinger of profoundly bad news for the Chinese economy, it's not necessarily going to be a serious problem for the typical American. Total US exports to China, for example, are only 0.7 percent of American GDP, meaning that continued economic growth in China isn't particularly significant to American businesses.</p>",Business & Finance

Taking a few minutes off work to order this or that on Amazon is a lot easier to get away with than leaving the office to go shop at Target.</p> \n<p>A typical Vox.com traffic pattern is to see many more people on our site during the workday than after work. There are more people on the site on weekdays than on weekends. Holiday traffic is low. And that's the pattern at every website I'm familiar with.

"Facebook's freebooting problem, explained",http://www.vox.com/2015/7/9/8922363/facebook-video-napster-youtube,Uploading videos to Facebook that you didn't make? You're not alone.,"<p>Facebook's biggest problem today is caused and supported by how you consume video — well, you and your family, friends, colleagues, and several of your favorite viral comedians. It's called freebooting, and it might soon rope you in, even though you might never get caught doing it. And if you're the person freebooting? You're enemy number one.</p> \n<p>On Thursday, Facebook <a href=""http://media.fb.com/2015/08/27/an-update-on-video-management-on-facebook/"" target=""_blank"">announced</a> it is expanding its ""video matching technology"" to a small set of video creators to fight against freebooting. What exactly is freebooting, anyway, and why is it so important to Mark Zuckerberg? It all comes back to you.</p> \n<h3>Friends with ad revenue benefits</h3> \n<p>How much should Facebook care about other people's problems? It has two philosophical paths to consider. It could turn into a rebellious, freewheeling Napster of video, ignoring the revenue models or copyrights of creators (a position in which <a href=""http://adage.com/article/media/viacom-youtube-napster-treatment/114743/"">YouTube </a>once found itself). Or it could fall in line with wide-ranging demands from video creators who want protection from unauthorized uploads. It's a difficult strategy call for Facebook to make and implement without hiccups, since the platform is home to more than a billion monthly active users.</p> \n<p><q class=""left"" aria-hidden=""true"">In the future, video will be even more important than photos —Mark Zuckerberg</q></p> \n<p>People who make money producing online videos want to see their work shared everywhere, especially on the largest social network in the world, right? The short answer is: sometimes. Many creators have voiced frustrations about users who upload videos without permission.</p> \n<p>Slate's Will Oremus <a href=""http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/technology/2015/07/freebooting_stolen_youtube_videos_going_viral_on_facebook.html"">interviewed</a> one unhappy creator, Destin Sandlin, whose videos were used by others on Facebook:</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>Two days after he published his tattoo video on YouTube, Sandlin got a message from one of his subscribers who had seen it on Facebook. It turned out his video was a viral smash there, too. In fact, it was spreading even faster on Facebook than it was on YouTube, with more than 18 million views in the first two days alone.</p> \n<p>The problem was that Sandlin had never posted it to Facebook, and the version of it that appeared in millions of users’ News Feeds overnight wasn’t his. Rather, a British lads’ magazine called<em>Zoo</em> had apparently downloaded (or ""<a href=""http://news.cnet.com/Service-lets-people-rip-videos-from-YouTube,-other-sites/2100-1025_3-6083555.html"">ripped</a>"") his video from YouTube, edited it to strip out references to Sandlin and his SmarterEveryDay channel, and posted the edited version on its own page, using Facebook’s native video player. It was an instant sensation, garnering millions of views and a raft of new followers for <em>Zoo</em>’s page. Sandlin, who puts some of the revenue from his YouTube videos toward his kids’ college fund, got nothing. (<em>Zoo</em>’s parent company, Bauer Media, declined to comment for this story.)</p> \n</blockquote> \n<h3>More online videos, more online problems</h3> \n<p>Unauthorized uploads are so common on Facebook, it has its own trendy name: <a href=""http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/technology/2015/07/freebooting_stolen_youtube_videos_going_viral_on_facebook.html"">freebooting</a>. Last year, Daily Dot's Rob Price <a href=""http://www.dailydot.com/entertainment/facebook-video-content-id-copyright-infringement/"">called</a> the practice an ""epidemic."" Let's be clear: Freebooting is explicitly against user rules. Creators are not always aware (or <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/help/348831205149904"">notified</a>) when it happens, though, and infringement can be hard to track down. Facebook <a href=""http://www.thevideoink.com/news/facebook-starts-scanning-video-uploads-copyright-infringement/"">scans videos</a> in an effort to limit abuse, lets creators report issues, and suspends repeat offenders, but uploading outlaws remain, aggravating producers.</p> \n<p>One particularly unique challenge for Facebook in connecting creators to content is tied to its <a href=""https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/03/facebook-has-clarified-its-policies-how-about-fixing-them"">real-name policy</a>; it can't authenticate content unless it recognizes what users call themselves, which is not always their birth name. Adding to the confusion, amateur video bloggers may not understand all of Facebook's rules, even if they rightfully demand a video is taken down.</p> \n<p>Many creators want Facebook to kill freebooting outright, but it's not a simple problem. It will take time for Facebook to come up with a solution that both users and creators mutually accept; there are no guarantees such a solution exists, anyway. In this sense, producers find themselves in a similar position as music record labels were in with Napster, coincidentally co-founded by <a href=""http://www.afr.com/news/world/north-america/napster-billionaire-sean-parker-takes-a-new-approach-to-charity-20150624-ghwisd"">Sean Parker</a> (Facebook's first president), or even the position <a href=""http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/03/18/us-google-viacom-lawsuit-idUSBREA2H11220140318"">Viacom</a> once held against YouTube.</p> \n<p>How you share all those cat videos, publicly and privately, will be increasingly monitored on the social network you're most likely to use today.</p>",Business & Finance
Germany's finance minister proposed swapping Greece for Puerto Rico. Jack Lew wisely turned him down.,http://www.vox.com/2015/7/9/8922379/schauble-puerto-rico,"Puerto Rico is richer, less indebted, and better protected.","<p>German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schauble, evidently tired of getting phone calls from American officials urging Germany to restructure Greece's debts, <a href=""http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-07-09/schaeuble-jokes-he-offered-lew-greece-for-puerto-rico"">says he trolled Treasury Secretary Jack Lew</a> a bit about the <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/7/1/8872553/puerto-rico-crisis"">ongoing debt crisis in Puerto Rico</a>.</p> \n<p>""I offered my friend Jack Lew these days that we could take Puerto Rico into the euro zone if the U.S. were willing to take Greece into the dollar union,"" Schauble said to Bloomberg. ""He thought that was a joke.""</p> \n<p>Presumably Schauble was, in fact, joking, but it's worth saying this would be a terrible trade for the United States of America. Puerto Rico is both smaller than Greece (3.5 million people versus 11 million) and considerably richer ($23,678 GDP per capita versus just $18,863).</p> \n<p>Nor are the debt situations remotely comparable.</p> \n<p>Puerto Rico owes about $70 billion, giving it a debt-to-GDP ratio of nearly 70 percent, while Greece owes €323 billion, or about 172 percent of Greek GDP.</p> \n<p>Last but by no means least, while Puerto Rico is in serious trouble from the standpoint of Puerto Rico,<em> </em>it is not by any means posing a threat to the stability of the United States of America or the dollar as a viable economic zone. Maybe the US Congress will <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/7/7/8906515/hillary-clinton-puerto-rico-bankruptcy"">let Puerto Rico default on its municipal debts</a>, or maybe it will give bondholders an unrestricted right to try to immiserate the island. Either way, many Puerto Ricans will probably continue moving to the US mainland. And either way, those Puerto Ricans who do remain on the island will nonetheless be protected by Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, the FDIC, and other US government programs.</p> \n<p>Puerto Rico is, in other words, richer than Greece, better protected on the downside, and <em>also</em> less of a problem for the rest of the dollar area.

What the Iran nuclear deal means for oil prices,http://www.vox.com/2015/7/14/8962651/oil-prices-iran-nuclear-deal,The deal could open up a huge new source of oil â€” but it will take months or even years to have a major impact.,"<p><span>From an economic standpoint, one of the most significant aspects of today's </span><a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/7/14/8962035/iran-nuclear-deal-500-words"" target=""_blank"">US-Iran nuclear deal</a><span> is that it could open up Iran's vast crude oil reserves to the rest of the world. Once Europe and the US ease their sanctions, Iran can ramp up crude production and exports, locking in this new era of low oil prices.</span></p> \n<p>But here's the catch — this won't all happen immediately. It will likely take at least six months before we see any significant oil impact from the deal, and possibly even longer than that.</p> \n<p>Even if all goes according to plan, the US and EU won't lift sanctions on Iran until 2016 at the earliest. Once that happens, Iran can finally start selling some of the roughly 30 to 40 million barrels of oil it currently has stored in vast floating tankers off its coast. That could help push oil prices down moderately.</p> \n<p>But after that, it might take years for Iran to get production in its crippled oil fields back to pre-sanctions levels. The country does possess vast crude reserves — but that doesn't mean it's all coming online tomorrow.</p> \n<h3>Iran has the world's fourth-largest oil reserves — but sanctions have crippled output</h3> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""3872916""><img src=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3872916/Screen%20Shot%202015-07-14%20at%201.22.03%20PM.png""></div> \n<p>Iran is sitting on some <a href=""http://www.eia.gov/beta/international/analysis.cfm?iso=IRN"">158 billion barrels</a> of crude oil, the fourth-largest proved reserves in the world. <span>But thanks to a slew of sanctions by the United States and Europe in recent years — meant to pressure Iran over its nuclear program — the nation's oil fields have fallen into serious decline, driven by a lack of investment.</span></p> \n<p>Back in 2008, Iran produced some 4 million barrels of oil per day. By May 2015, that had fallen to just 2.8 million barrels per day. (To put that in perspective, the entire world uses about 90 million barrels of oil per day, so this is a significant amount.)</p> \n<h3>Iran currently has 30 to 40 million barrels of oil stored at sea</h3> \n<p>On top of that, Iran has been having trouble selling the oil that it <i>can </i>still pump out — particularly after the EU <a href=""http://uk.reuters.com/article/2012/10/12/uk-iran-shipping-insurance-idUKBRE89B07W20121012"" target=""_blank"">imposed sanctions</a> in 2012 that barred insurers from covering ships that carry Iranian oil.</p> \n<p>Iran's exports plummeted from 2.6 million barrels per day in 2011 down to 1.4 million barrels per day in 2014 — with sales going mainly to China, India, Japan, South Korea, and Turkey:</p> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""3872890""><img src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3872890/crude_oil_exports.png""></div> \n<p>The rest is just ... sitting there. Iran has been storing much of the oil that it can't export on massive floating tankers off its coast. Most estimates suggest they have <a href=""https://www.iea.org/media/omrreports/fullissues/2015-04-15.pdf"" target=""_blank"">around 30 to 40 million barrels</a> in storage, with about half of that crude oil and the other half <a href=""http://www.eia.gov/tools/glossary/index.cfm?id=Lease"">condensates</a>.</p> \n<p><span>This, in theory, should be the first effect of the Iran deal. Once sanctions are lifted, this stored oil can get sold off. The key question is how quickly this will all happen.</span></p> \n<h3>Sanctions won't be lifted for at least six months</h3> \n<p>So now comes <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/7/14/8962035/iran-nuclear-deal-500-words"" target=""_blank"">the US-Iran nuclear deal</a>, in which Iran gives up the bulk of its nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief. In theory, that  will allow Iran to boost oil exports and production.</p> \n<p>But it will be at least six months before sanctions start getting lifted — and even that might be optimistic. Richard Nephew, a former State Department official who served as lead sanctions expert for the US team negotiating with Iran, <a href=""http://energypolicy.columbia.edu/sites/default/files/energy/Commentary%20on%20the%20Nuclear%20Deal%20between%20Iran%20and%20the%20P5%2B1.pdf"">explains the timeline here</a>:</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>First, the agreement involves an extensive procedure for ascertaining the support of home legislative and other legal bodies for it. In the US system, this will take at least 30-60 days as Congress will need to receive the text of the deal, hold hearings on it, and decide what to do. ....</p> \n<p>Second, the implementation will itself take months. Iran’s list of nuclear steps is long, as is appropriate considering they are the party in need of building the most confidence. I’ve noted for a long time that removal and storage of centrifuges will be the long-pole in the timing tent, and nothing in the text contradicts this. Based on the schedule in the document, all of this work will not even start until after 90 days from today (the end of October) and it will take months from that point to fully execute the remaining changes to Iran’s nuclear program.</p> \n<p><b>Third, sanctions relief itself will not flow until these nuclear steps are completed.</b> There will be meetings and business trips by trading companies, investment firms, and by oil companies and potentially even concluded contracts (if not signed until the deal comes into force). But, if these steps cross the sanctions line, the Obama Administration has made clear that it will be forced to act. Iran will not and cannot obtain relief without having completed its part of the bargain.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>So Iran shouldn't expect sanctions relief until the first half of 2016 — and possibly even later than that, if implementation ends up getting bogged down in mistrust or other disputes.</p> \n<h3>Even after sanctions are lifted, Iran could struggle to boost production</h3> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""3873234"" alt=""shutterstock_230666905.0.jpg"" src=""https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3873234/shutterstock_230666905.0.jpg""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">(Shutterstock)</p> \n<p>Once sanctions are lifted, Iran has several options. First, it can start selling all that oil it has sitting in offshore tankers. Iran probably won't want to unload this <i>all</i> at once (since that could cause prices to crash), but the International Energy Agency <a href=""https://www.iea.org/media/omrreports/fullissues/2015-04-15.pdf"">estimates</a> that it could sell some 180,000 barrels per day for six months.</p> \n<p>Those sales would bump up global crude supplies modestly, although they're unlikely to upend oil markets on their own. (That said, we might see other countries increase their own production in response to these sales, as they fight to maintain market share. That would push prices down further.)</p> \n<p>After that, Iran will likely try to bolster production in some of its existing fields, although it's unclear how much is actually possible. The IEA <a href=""https://www.iea.org/media/omrreports/fullissues/2015-04-15.pdf"" target=""_blank"">estimates</a> that Iran will be able to increase oil production from its current level of 2.8 million barrels per day to around 3.5 million barrels per day ""within months of sanctions being lifted.""</p> \n<p>But Nephew, for his part, <a href=""http://energypolicy.columbia.edu/sites/default/files/energy/Commentary%20on%20the%20Nuclear%20Deal%20between%20Iran%20and%20the%20P5%2B1.pdf"" target=""_blank"">is skeptical</a> that Iran can ratchet up production that quickly. For one, he says, Iran is facing ""fatigued fields and antiquated equipment."" Once pumping ceases in a field, it's not so simple to just flip a switch and turn it back on. By some estimates, Iran will need $50 billion to $100 billion in foreign investment to get production back up to pre-sanctions levels. That could take years.</p> \n<p>What's more, Nephew points out, foreign investors are likely to be wary about rushing into Iran. ""Iran itself is a difficult environment in which to work,"" he writes. ""The Iranian bureaucracy is formidable and it will be a real achievement if the Iranian government is able to deliver on its bait to international oil companies and others to make the process less painful.""</p> \n<p>Plus, there's always the risk that the nuclear deal falls through and the United States and Europe reimpose sanctions: ""Sanctions snap-back is a real threat and businesses would be well-advised to design their contracts with Iran accordingly. Companies and banks that develop business ties in Iran will need to be prepared to have them vacated immediately if Iranian cheating is detected.""</p> \n<p>Bottom line: The IEA thinks Iran can get back to producing 4 million barrels of oil per day — the level it was at in 2008 — by the end of this decade. Oil Minister Bijan Namdar Zangeneh wants Iran to resume its spot as the world's No. 2 oil exporter behind Saudi Arabia (a spot currently occupied by Russia). But that's far from assured, and there could easily be hiccups on the way.</p> \n<h3>What would more Iranian oil mean for the US? Lower gas prices, for one.</h3> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3873682/GettyImages-463901462.0.jpg"" alt=""GettyImages-463901462.0.jpg"" data-chorus-asset-id=""3873682""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Lower gas prices? Maybe. (Cheryl A. Guerrero/Los Angeles Times via Getty Images)</p> \n<p>If Iran <em>can </em>ramp up oil production in the coming years, that would put downward pressure on global oil prices, which in turn could be a big deal for the United States<span>. </span></p> \n<p><span>Global crude oil prices </span><a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/12/16/7401705/oil-prices-falling"" target=""_blank"">have already fallen</a><span> from $115 per barrel last June to around $58 per barrel today — a major storyline for the global economy. </span><span>That price crash, in turn, has pushed down gasoline prices and made driving cheaper for Americans, freeing up money to spend on other things. </span></p> \n<p>On the flip side, low prices have <i>also</i> squeezed US oil companies working in costly shale regions like North Dakota and Texas. Over the past year, drillers have responded to lower prices <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/3/27/8301165/oil-production-low-prices"" target=""_blank"">by slashing costs and steadily improving efficiency</a> — and US oil production has held surprisingly steady. But fresh competition from Iran will make this task even tougher.</p> \n<p>That said, the Iran story is likely to unfold over several years — it won't happen right away.

Minneapolis has a surprisingly simple plan to cut traffic and make housing more affordable,http://www.vox.com/2015/7/15/8970119/parking-affordable-housing,"The huge cost of ""free"" parking.","<p>For a long time in Minneapolis, almost everyone who wanted to build a new apartment complex was required to add one parking spot for every unit in the building — whether or not residents wanted one.</p> \n<p>There was an exception for a small area downtown, but not for outlying neighborhoods served by <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metro_(Minnesota)"">light rail and bus systems</a>. And all these unneeded or unwanted parking spots would <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/6/27/5849280/why-free-parking-is-bad-for-everyone"">add to the cost of construction, drive up rent, encourage driving, and take up valuable land</a> as they sat empty. This sort of minimum parking requirement is the law in <a href=""http://www.citylab.com/commute/2013/08/exposed-americas-totally-inconsistent-minimum-parking-requirements/6598/"">almost every city across the country</a>.</p> \n<p><!--  ########  BEGIN SNIPPET  ########  --></p> \n<div class=""chorus-snippet s-related"" data-analytics-action=""link:related"" data-analytics-category=""article"">\n<span class=""s-related__title"">Related</span> <!-- Add links here --><a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/6/27/5849280/why-free-parking-is-bad-for-everyone"">Why free parking is bad for everyone</a>\n</div> \n<p>Now, however, Minneapolis's City Council has <a href=""http://www.startribune.com/mpls-relaxes-parking-requirements-to-reduce-housing-costs/313286521/"">voted to eliminate the parking requirement</a> for many new buildings.</p> \n<p>Small or midsize buildings that are within walking distance (specifically, a quarter-mile) of a rail or bus line no longer have to build any off-street parking at all. Large buildings (those with 50 or more units) now only have to provide one space for every two units.</p> \n<p>It's not perfect, but it's a huge step in the right direction — and one that other cities nationwide should follow if they care about providing affordable housing or reducing traffic.</p> \n<h3>The huge cost of ""free"" parking</h3> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3876176/148247814.0.jpg"" alt=""parking garage"" data-chorus-asset-id=""3876176""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">(David McNew/Getty Images)</p> \n<p>Cities originally created minimum parking requirements because they didn't want residents' cars clogging up street parking. Mandating the construction garages or off-street lots would ensure that didn't happen.</p> \n<p>But in practice, parking is an urban real estate amenity that responds to demand just as well as, say, fitness centers or pools. If residents are looking for buildings with parking, developers are free to provide it — and even though the requirement was eliminated in downtown Minneapolis years ago, most developers <a href=""http://finance-commerce.com/2015/06/minneapolis-panel-oks-reduced-parking-requirements/"">have continued to do so</a>.</p> \n<p>But a strict requirement means that every building has to include parking whether residents want it or not. Typically, the cost of that parking then gets built into the rent. It might not seem like a big deal, but in Washington, DC, the underground spots many developers use to comply with these requirements each <a href=""http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/blogs/housingcomplex/2012/03/21/park-it/"">cost between $30,000 and $50,000</a> to build.</p> \n<p>This makes housing less affordable — especially for low-income residents who are <a href=""http://www.abag.ca.gov/services/finance/fan/housingmyths2.htm"">least likely to own cars</a> in the first place. It also subsidizes driving, spurring further development that's based around the car, such as stores that provide free parking, effectively building its cost into the price of their goods.</p> \n<p>""The worst thing that many American cities have done, for low-income people, is create a world in which you <em>need</em> a car,"" retired UCLA economist <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/6/27/5849280/why-free-parking-is-bad-for-everyone"">Donald Shoup told me in an interview last year</a>.

A <a href=""http://today.uconn.edu/blog/2014/03/urban-parking-at-any-price/"">2014 study found</a> that for each parking spot — taking up space that could otherwise be occupied by a taxpaying business — the city of Hartford gives up about $1,200 in tax revenue annually, for a total loss of $50 million. In some cities, <a href=""http://www.citylab.com/commute/2014/06/how-parking-lots-became-the-scourge-of-american-downtowns/372207/"">huge percentages of increasingly empty downtowns</a> have been given over to surface lots in order to comply with these requirements.</p> \n<p>All of which is to say: Minneapolis, like a handful of other cities, is taking a very positive step in relaxing its parking requirements.

For this reason girls are not considered for the training school.""</p> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""3880252""><img src=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3880252/632255233_213684641e_o.jpg""></div> \n<p>Almost an exact version of it was sent to <a href=""http://animationguildblog.blogspot.com/2006/06/disney-1939-girls-are-not-considered.html"">Frances Brewer</a> in 1939, although on significantly less-cool letterhead.</p> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""3881000"">\n<img data-chorus-asset-id=""3881000"" alt=""Letter2.0.jpg"" src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3881000/Letter2.0.jpg""> \n<p class=""caption"">(<a href=""http://animationguildblog.blogspot.com/2006/06/disney-1939-girls-are-not-considered.html?m=1"" target=""_blank"">Animation Guild</a>)</p> \n</div> \n<p>It’s not that Disney didn’t employ women. It employed lots of them as ""inkers"" who corrected and filled animations, and worked in physically separate environments from the more prestigious male animators. In this video, you can see how the studio separated ""creative"" animation from inking:</p> \n<p><iframe width=""100%"" height=""315"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/mhfp6Z8z1cI"" frameborder=""0""></iframe></p> \n<p>But inking is just another part of the animation process — at times a grueling one, as Vanity Fair <a href=""http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2010/03/disney-animation-girls-201003"">profiled</a> in 2010. The segregation of work was doomed to fail, in part because of war. In 1941, the studio began training female employees to animate, and in a <a href=""http://www.cartoonbrew.com/disney/walt-disney-was-no-gender-bigot-94682.html"">speech</a>, Walt Disney told employees why. Note that Disney calls the adult women employees ""girls"":</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>The girls are being trained for inbetweens for very good reasons. The first is, to make them more versatile, so that the peak loads of inbetweening and inking can be handled. Believe me when I say that the more versatile our organization is, the more beneficial it is to the employees, for it assures steady employment for the employee, as well as steady production turnover for the Studio.</p> \n<p>The second reason is that the possibility of a war, let alone the peacetime conscription, may take many of our young men now employed, and especially many of the young applicants. I believe that if there is to be a business for these young men to come back to after the war, it must be maintained during the war. The girls can help here.</p> \n<p>Third, the girl artists have the right to expect the same chances for advancement as men, and I honestly believe that they may eventually contribute something to this business that men never would or could. In the present group that are training for inbetweens there are definite prospects, and a good example is to mention the work of Ethel Kulsar and Sylvia Holland on ""The Nutcracker Suite,"" and little Retta Scott, of whom you will hear more when you see <em>Bambi.</em></p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>It's easy to forget that tragic events like war can, at times, yield positive social benefits, but the need for a reliable pool of workers seems to have pushed Walt Disney to allow women to ""contribute something to this business that men never could or would."" But don't take the historic changes in training to mean there's no longer a need or room for progress — Disney had its <a href=""http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-frozen-get-a-horse-female-director-20131124-story.html#page=1"">first woman film director</a> in 2013 (<i>Frozen</i>).</p>",Business & Finance

Avid Life has attempted to contain the damage by making the account deletion feature free. But if the hacked data is genuine, then that horse is already out of the barn. And future customers will think twice before entrusting their personal data to the company.</p> \n<hr> \n<!--  ########  BEGIN VOLUME VIDEO  ########  --> \n<div class=""volume-video"" id=""volume-placement-3180"" data-volume-placement=""article"" data-analytics-placement=""entry:middle"" data-volume-id=""2422"" data-volume-uuid=""c2f5fb24a"" data-analytics-label=""Expensive wine is for suckers | 2422"" data-analytics-action=""volume:view:entry:middle"" data-analytics-viewport=""video""></div> \n<!--  ########  END VOLUME VIDEO  ########  -->",Business & Finance

No single city won the top spot in every factor ranking, which makes sense: Some cities have more houses available to buy, but the options may not be in good living environments, and vice versa.</p> \n<h3>Location, location, population</h3> \n<p>Overland Park, with fewer than 200,000 residents, hit a high of about 75 degrees on Tuesday. Beyond good weather, homebuyers also care about things like proximity to family, jobs, and lifestyle preferences. Since bigger cities tend to offer more options, let's take a look at how they ranked (again, blue is friendlier):</p> \n<p><iframe src=""//d2e70e9yced57e.cloudfront.net/wallethub/embed/5564/geochart-homebuyer2.html"" width=""556"" height=""347"" frameborder=""0"" scrolling=""no""></iframe></p> \n<p> </p> \n<div style=""width: 556px; font-size: 12px; color: #888;"">(<a href=""http://wallethub.com/edu/best-and-worst-cities-for-first-time-home-buyers/5564/"">WalletHub</a>)</div> \n<p> </p> \n<p>There's one big problem with using population size alone as a measurement of opportunity: Many cities are struggling to grow their economy despite a large population. A good example of this is Detroit, which ranked 104th out of the 300 largest global metropolitan areas in a <a href=""http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/Research/Files/Reports/2015/01/22-global-metro-monitor/bmpp_GMM_final.pdf?la=en"">Brookings Institution</a> study of city growth since 2009. When comparing the growth of the same 300 cities between 2013 and 2014, Detroit ranked 237th.</p> \n<p>So if you still want to buy in or near a city, consider a smaller city. In the ranking below, large is considered to be a city with more than 300,000 residents, midsize is 150,000 to 300,000, and small is fewer than 150,000. Just look at all these unusual options:</p> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""3894386""><img src=""https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3894386/Screen%20Shot%202015-07-21%20at%2011.16.46%20AM.png""></div> \n<p>How do you feel about Frisco, Texas (and not ""Frisco,"" California)?

Appleâ€™s new earnings report shows that big phones are displacing tablets,http://www.vox.com/2015/7/21/9011615/apple-earnings-ipad-iphone,"Apple is not only selling more iPhones, but its largest iPhone model is selling particularly well.","<p>We're used to thinking of smartphones and tablets as separate product categories. The first iPhone was small — its screen measured 3.5 inches diagonally. The original iPad was big — its screen was almost 10 inches.</p> \n<p>But it's becoming clear that for many customers, the ""sweet spot"" for a touchscreen mobile device is somewhere in the middle. More evidence for this can be found in <a href=""https://www.apple.com/pr/pdf/q3fy15datasum_2.pdf"">Apple's latest financial results</a>.</p> \n<p>On the one hand, iPads <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/4/27/8505479/ipad-sales-drop"">continued</a> their two-year-long decline. Between April and June 2015, Apple sold 18 percent fewer iPads than in the same quarter of 2014.

Apple introduced two new, larger iPhones last September, and they've been a big hit with consumers. The company sold 35 percent more iPhones last quarter than in the same quarter of 2014. But revenue from those iPhones grew by an even more impressive 59 percent.</p> \n<p>That suggests that not only do consumers love Apple's larger iPhone, but that Apple sold a fair number of the larger iPhone 6 Plus — which retails for an extra $100 — last quarter.</p>",Business & Finance

But Uber organized a massive public protest that forced the mayor to scrap the proposal.</p> \n<p><span>In an overwhelmingly liberal city, both sides have argued that they represent the progressive side of the debate.

Andrew Cuomo, who weighed in on the debate on Wednesday. ""I don’t think government should be in the business of trying to restrict job growth,"" he said in a radio interview.</p> \n<h3>Is Uber really responsible for congestion in New York City?</h3> \n<p>It's hard to say, but the four-month study contemplated in the new deal might give us a better idea.</p> \n<p>Uber has about 26,000 drivers in New York City — about double the number of conventional taxicabs. On the other hand, there are a lot of other cars on the street in New York, too. <a href=""http://fusion.net/story/170159/uber-mohrer-deblasio/"">Uber says</a> that a total of 2.7 million people enter New York in their own cars each day; that includes about <a href=""http://www.nyc.gov/html/dcp/pdf/mn_core/mncore_study.pdf"">750,000 vehicles</a> entering Manhattan below 60th street every workday.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""right""><span>About </span><span>750,000 vehicles</span><span> enter Manhattan below 60th street every workday</span></q></p> \n<p>Of course, an Uber car is going to be on the road longer than a regular private car, so Uber may be contributing more to congestion problems than you'd think from the raw numbers. On the other hand, some Uber trips are replacing ones that people would have taken in their own cars, saving parking spaces and congestion from people circling the block looking for parking.</p> \n<p>And this could be especially true in the long run. By making it easier for people to get around without a car, services like Uber may encourage more people to give up owning their own vehicles.</p> \n<h3>How would a cap have affected Uber service?</h3> \n<p>Uber had depicted it as a disaster for its customers. It had <a href=""http://fusion.net/story/168243/uber-just-added-a-de-blasio-tab-in-its-app-in-new-york-to-protest-the-mayors-proposed-legislation/"">added a ""de Blasio"" tab</a> on its app purporting to show the long wait times that would occur if the mayor's proposal for a cap was adopted.</p> \n<p>The company says it's attracting 25,000 new customers a week and has to hire hundreds of drivers per week to keep up with the demand. If it can't do that, there could be driver shortages and long waits to get an Uber.</p> \n<p>Presumably, Uber would deal with this problem by raising prices — either increasing prices across the board or invoking <a href=""https://help.uber.com/h/6c8065cf-5535-4a8b-9940-d292ffdce119"">surge pricing</a> more often to deal with demand spikes.</p> \n<h3><span>Why does Uber say the cap would harm minorities?</span></h3> \n<p>African Americans have long complained that taxicabs don't serve them well. Cabbies would sometimes refuse to stop to pick up black people, and taxicabs would spend disproportionate time in Manhattan — where fares are easiest to find — rather than in outlying areas where many minorities live.</p> \n<p>Uber says its smartphone-based hailing technology has helped with this. Its software tracks how drivers respond to hails and penalizes those who decline them too often, discouraging them from discriminating among passengers. And the technology also makes it easier for drivers and passengers to find each other in the relatively sparsely populated outer boroughs.</p> \n<p><iframe frameborder=""0"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/ePAxy5PCeuk"" height=""480"" width=""853""></iframe></p> \n<p>Uber says this responsiveness has been made possible by rapid growth in the number of drivers. By flooding the market, the company is able to ensure that even people in the outlying areas of the city are able to get a car in a reasonable amount of time. But Uber's drivers are free agents; Uber can't order them to the outer boroughs. So if demand outstrips supply, drivers are likely to focus on the busiest areas of Manhattan, where wait times are shortest.</p> \n<p>And Uber has had some success rallying black leaders to its side. For example, two black elected officials from outlying areas of New York <a href=""http://observer.com/2015/07/outerborough-pols-say-de-blasios-uber-cap-will-hurt-minorities/"">denounced de Blasio's proposal</a> at an Uber-organized rally yesterday.</p> \n<p> </p> \n<h3>What was the mayor's case against Uber?</h3> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""3898042"" alt=""GettyImages-480707796.0.jpg"" src=""https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3898042/GettyImages-480707796.0.jpg""></p> \n<p> </p> \n<p class=""caption"">New York Mayor Bill de Blasio. (Spencer Platt/Getty Images)</p> \n<p> </p> \n<p>While de Blasio's case for the cap has focused on congestion concerns, the mayor has also made the case that Uber is a bad corporate citizen that has grown wealthy by exploiting its drivers.</p> \n<p>Uber classifies its drivers as independent contractors rather than employees. That means they don't get health insurance or disability benefits, nor does Uber reimburse them for work expenses as a company would for an employee. Uber's critics have charged that this is unfair and illegal. Last month, one California regulator <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/6/17/8799951/uber-california-ruling-explained"">agreed with the critics</a>, ruling that Uber drivers were employees under California law, which entitled them to more benefits.</p> \n<h3>Why is the taxi industry interested in this issue?</h3> \n<p>Every business benefits from limiting its competition; conventional taxi companies have long lobbied to limit the expansion of ride-hailing companies like Uber and Lyft.</p> \n<p>But taxi companies also have a more direct financial interest in limiting the expansion of those competing services. To operate a cab in New York requires a taxi medallion, and the number of medallions has grown much more slowly than demand. As a result, operating a taxi became extremely lucrative, and the <a href=""http://www.thestreet.com/story/13153924/1/how-uber-is-actually-killing-the-value-of-a-new-york-city-taxi-medallion.html"">value of these medallions has skyrocketed</a> to as much as $1.3 million each.</p> \n<p>But since Uber entered the market, taxis have faced more competition, and so the value of taxi medallions has been falling. That's another reason taxi companies — which have given to Mayor de Blasio's campaign — would benefit from limits on the number of ride-hailing cars on the road.</p> \n<h3>Watch: The economics of being a driver for hire</h3> \n<!--  ########  BEGIN VOLUME VIDEO  ########  --> \n<div data-volume-id=""255"" data-analytics-placement=""entry:middle"" data-volume-placement=""article"" id=""volume-placement-9491"" class=""volume-video"" data-volume-uuid=""07d83338f"" data-analytics-label=""The math of being a Lyft driver | 255"" data-analytics-action=""volume:view:entry:middle"" data-analytics-viewport=""video""></div> \n<!--  ########  END VOLUME VIDEO  ########  -->",Business & Finance

But that's part of the reason talking about Uber is good politics for Republicans. It could help the party appeal to young, urban professionals who lean toward Democrats on cultural grounds but might find things to like in the GOP's economic message. It helps to drive a wedge between Uber-using urban professionals and more traditional — or more deeply ideological — liberals who see Uber's ""gig economy"" model as a threat to worker rights.</p> \n<p>Of course, Uber itself cares less about presidential politics than about local regulation, where things tend to be less partisan in practice. Some Republican officeholders have been hostile to Uber, while many Democratic ones have been supportive. When the rubber meets the road, ordinary interest-group politics wind up mattering more than ideological considerations. But that doesn't stop Uber from being a potent tool in national politics, serving as a symbol for liberal fears and conservative hopes.</p> \n<h3>Why Republican candidates love Uber</h3> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""3902290"" alt=""GettyImages-477618242.0.jpg"" src=""https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3902290/GettyImages-477618242.0.jpg""></p> \n<p> </p> \n<p class=""caption"">Marco Rubio points toward a sharing-economy future.

Marco Rubio has been <a href=""http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2014/03/24/why-marco-rubios-embracing-uber"">touting Uber</a> for over a year, and he <a href=""https://twitter.com/marcorubio/status/623961046601080836"">tweeted in support</a> of Uber during this week's confrontation with New York Mayor Bill de Blasio.</p> \n<p>Ted Cruz <a href=""http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/410219/ted-cruz-im-just-uber-washington-brendan-bordelon"">compared himself to Uber</a> last December, saying he hoped to disrupt Washington in the same way Uber has disrupted the taxi business. <a href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/rand-paul-hillary-clinton-uber-2015-7"">Rand Paul</a> tweeted in defense of Uber earlier this month, and Scott Walker <a href=""http://host.madison.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/scott-walker-signs-uber-bill-over-local-objections/article_bfe1f43e-ab74-5a26-873e-4ff1e1da5e38.html"">signed Uber-friendly legislation</a> in May.</p> \n<p>It's natural for conservatives to side with a business fighting regulators, but the inclination to highlight <em>this particular business </em>has a lot to do with political demographics. Republican voters tend to be older and more rural than Democrats. Uber has a young and disproportionately urban customer base.

(Melina Mara/the Washington Post via Getty Images)</p> \n<p> </p> \n<p>Best of all for Republicans, Uber makes a great wedge issue. Some liberals dislike Uber on ideological grounds, but others — especially in the media, politics, and technology centers of New York, Washington, and San Francisco — are regular Uber customers.</p> \n<p>On one side of this debate are old-school liberals with strong ties to the labor movement and urban political machines. For them, Uber is a conventional story about worker and consumer rights. Labor unions believe Uber is flouting the law by classifying workers as independent contractors rather than employees. And they would love to <a href=""http://www.fastcompany.com/3037371/the-teamsters-of-the-21st-century-how-uber-lyft-and-facebook-drivers-are-organizing"">unionize Uber's fast-growing workforce</a>.</p> \n<p>More broadly, conventional liberals are suspicious of claims that deregulation and innovation will benefit workers and consumers in the long run. They view Uber's ""gig economy"" as part of a broader trend toward declining worker power. They blame decades of deregulation — under both Republicans and centrist Democrats like Bill Clinton — for this trend, and believe stricter regulation of Uber could be part of a larger trend toward stricter regulation of labor markets more generally.</p> \n<p>In his <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/7/22/9015443/bill-de-blasio-uber"">campaign against Uber</a> this week, Bill de Blasio primarily focused on congestion concerns, but he also <a href=""http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jul/22/bill-de-blasio-blinks-in-uber-standoff/"">mentioned workers' rights</a> as a major concern.</p> \n<p>On the other side of the debate are liberals — many of them Uber customers — who see Uber as an innovative company fighting entrenched special interests. While they might be sympathetic to theoretical arguments for government regulation, they remember what the taxi market was like before Uber came along.</p> \n<p>Recognizing that in practice it needs friends in big liberal cities, Uber has worked hard to cultivate this base of support. Uber <a href=""https://newsroom.uber.com/2014/08/a-leader-for-the-uber-campaign/"">hired Obama strategist David Plouffe</a> last year to help the company craft its political strategy, and Uber CEO Travis Kalanick has <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2014/11/17/why-uber-loves-obamacare/"">hailed Obamacare</a> for helping Uber drivers get health insurance.</p> \n<p>Hillary Clinton wants to attract supporters from both of these camps, so she has carefully <a href=""http://thehill.com/policy/technology/248639-uber-exec-says-clinton-will-embrace-gig-economy"">hedged her bets</a>.

Jan Brewer, the Republican who was Arizona governor until January, <a href=""http://www.azcentral.com/story/news/arizona/politics/2014/04/24/brewer-rejects-ride-share-uber-bill/8128621/"">vetoed pro-Uber legislation</a> last year (her Republican successor has been <a href=""http://www.cnbc.com/2015/06/26/a-governor-who-chose-to-ride-with-uber-over-regulators.html"" target=""_blank"">more favorable</a> to Uber). The Orlando Airport Authority, chaired by a <a href=""http://www.flgov.com/gov-rick-scott-reappoints-frank-kruppenbacher-to-greater-orlando-aviation-authority/"">Republican appointee</a>, has been <a href=""http://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/breaking-news/os-uber-orlando-airport-lawsuit-20150423-story.html"">feuding</a> with Uber, as has the city government in <a href=""http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/local/article/Everything-you-need-to-know-about-San-Antonio-s-6115142.php"">conservative San Antonio, Texas</a>.</p> \n<p>One reason for this divide is that presidential candidates don't actually have much skin in the game. Car services are mostly regulated at the state and local level, so the next president won't have much power to help or hurt Uber. So it's easy for Republicans seeking the presidency to employ pro-Uber rhetoric without committing to any specific policy positions.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, state and local officeholders have to worry more about the practical aspects of regulating Uber. Republicans have to worry about political pressures from taxi companies and others who are threatened by Uber's rise. And they have to worry that an excessively laissez-faire approach could fail to properly protect consumers and workers.</p> \n<p>The opposite point applies for Democrats. Liberal politicians who are sympathetic to anti-Uber arguments in theory have to contend with the fact that thousands of constituents are regular Uber users, which helps explain why Democrat-controlled states like <a href=""http://www.insurancejournal.com/news/west/2015/07/01/373690.htm"">California</a> and <a href=""http://www.denverpost.com/business/ci_25907057/colorado-first-authorize-lyft-and-ubers-ridesharing-services"">Colorado</a> have passed Uber-friendly legislation.</p> \n<p>And that means that national Republicans' enthusiasm for Uber isn't necessarily a good thing for the company. The national Republican Party would love to make Uber into a partisan wedge issue. But if they succeed, it won't be good for Uber, because the policy decisions Uber cares about most are made by mayors and city councils in big cities. And those are going to be in Democratic hands for the foreseeable future.</p> \n<p><b>Correction:</b> This story originally implied that Jan Brewer was governor of Arizona, but she stepped down in January.</p>",Business & Finance
Chrysler recalls 1.4 million vehicles after hackers show they're flawed,http://www.vox.com/2015/7/24/9034325/chrysler-jeep-recall-hackers,"After security researchers demonstrated they could hack into a Jeep Cherokee from miles away, its manufacturer is upgrading the vehicle's software.","<p> </p> \n<ul> \n<li><span>Fiat Chrysler is recalling 1.4 million vehicles to fix security flaws with their cellular radios.</span></li> \n<li><span>The vulnerability allows hackers to gain control of the vehicles' computer systems from hundreds of miles away.</span></li> \n<li> <span>The recall includes </span><span>Dodge, Jeep, Ram, and Chrysler car models.</span> </li> \n<li><span> \n<p class=""p1"">Chrysler will distribute USB sticks with upgraded software to affected customers.</p> \n</span></li> \n</ul> \n<h3>Hackers demonstrated security flaws earlier this week</h3> \n<p>In a <a href=""http://www.wired.com/2015/07/hackers-remotely-kill-jeep-highway"">terrifying demonstration</a> to Wired reporter Andy Greenberg earlier this week, two hackers showed the ability to hack into a Jeep Cherokee from miles away, gain control of its internal network, and then tamper with its transmission, brakes, and other safety-critical features.</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>As the two hackers remotely toyed with the air-conditioning, radio, and windshield wipers, I mentally congratulated myself on my courage under pressure. That’s when they cut the transmission.</p> \n<p>Immediately my accelerator stopped working. As I frantically pressed the pedal and watched the RPMs climb, the Jeep lost half its speed, then slowed to a crawl. This occurred just as I reached a long overpass, with no shoulder to offer an escape. The experiment had ceased to be fun.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>The hackers, Charlie Miller and Chris Valasek, are professional security researchers, so they aren't planning to use their discovery for evil. But malicious hackers could use the same techniques to remotely tamper with cars across the country. From his home in the St. Louis area, Miller scanned the network for vulnerable vehicles and showed Greenberg vulnerable cars in Texarkana, Texas; San Diego; and Michigan's Upper Peninsula. If he'd wanted to, he could have hacked into any of these vehicles and interfered with their brakes and transmissions, potentially causing a crash.</p> \n<p>Miller and Valasek notified Chrysler about this problem nine months ago, and the company <a href=""http://media.fcanorthamerica.com/newsrelease.do?&amp;id=16827&amp;mid=1"">recently released a software patch</a> to fix the vulnerability. However, that patch wasn't easy for customers to install. The decision to issue a formal recall suggests that Chrysler is now taking the problem more seriously.</p> \n<p><span>According to the </span><a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.wsj.com/articles/fiat-chrysler-recalls-1-4-million-vehicles-amid-hacking-concerns-1437751526"">Wall Street Journal</a><span>, affected vehicles include ""2013-2015 Dodge Viper specialty vehicles; a variety of 2013-2015 Ram pickup trucks and chassis cabs; 2014-2015 Jeep Grand Cherokee and Cherokee SUVs; 2014-2015 Dodge Durango SUVs; 2015 Chrysler 200, Chrysler 300 and Dodge Charger sedans; and 2015 Dodge Challenger sports coupes.""</span></p> \n<p><span>The move underscores the fact that car manufacturers are in the software business now. Security is one of the most important responsibilities of a major software company. Companies like Microsoft and Google have hundreds of security experts on staff — and security flaws in Windows and Android generally won't get anyone killed. Car companies are going to have to beef up their own security capabilities if they want to keep their customers safe from hackers.</span></p>",Business & Finance

The best way for Germany to help Europe is to cut taxes,http://www.vox.com/2015/7/29/9066671/germany-tax-cut,Europe doesn't need German charity â€” it needs self-indulgence.,"<p>There's one thing everyone thinks they know about the seemingly endless problems in the eurozone: It's about who will make sacrifices, the thrifty Germans or the heavily indebted south.</p> \n<p>Except this is totally wrong, as economist Robert Waldmann <a href=""http://rjwaldmann.blogspot.com/2015/07/daniel-davies-and-brad-delong-debate.html"">explains in a brilliant paragraph</a> that comes in the midst of an effort to adjudicate a debate between two other writers. What Europe needs from Germany is not sacrifice, but self-indulgence — lower taxes, higher wages, and more consumption:</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>I would say that the Eurozone has two huge problems. One is that Greece has debts it can't and won't repay. The other is that aggregate demand is too low. One perfectly fine solution to the aggregate demand problem would be for German taxpayers to grit their teeth and accept a tax cut. This would stimulate German demand including demand for imports. If Germans were feeling incredibly generous, they might also consider accepting an increase in wages. What the Euroblock needs most is higher aggregate demand -- self indulgence, the illusion of wealth of those who think government bonds are net wealth and all that. What we need is less German self sacrifice not more.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>The case for a German tax cut is even stronger when you consider that the country is currently <a href=""http://www.bloomberg.com/quote/GDBR10:IND"">paying an interest rate of less than 0.7 percent</a> on its 10-year bonds. When you take inflation into account, it's actually cheaper for Germany to pay for government spending with debt than with taxes.</p> \n<p>Germany levies a 19 percent value-added tax (basically a sales tax) on almost all consumer good purchases. A nice big cut in that rate — financed entirely with borrowing rather than spending cuts — would make German people better off, with benefits especially flowing to lower-income Germans, students, and retirees. But it would also speed up economic recovery throughout the continent. It is a win-win option that would by no means solve all of Europe's problems, but would ameliorate most of them.</p>",Business & Finance

But that could alienate the demanding users it already has.,"<p><span>Yesterday, Twitter released financial results that beat Wall Street's expectations. The company is still losing money, but its losses were smaller than many feared. Today, Twitter's stock </span><a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.bbc.com/news/business-33698676"">plunged by 13 percent</a><span> anyway.</span></p> \n<p>The problem: Comments by Twitter executives in the earnings call set off alarm bells for investors. ""We don't expect to see sustained, meaningful growth until we reach the mass market,"" <a href=""http://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2015/07/28/twitter-second-quarter-results-jack-dorsey/30792531/"">said chief financial officer Anthony Noto</a>. ""We expect it to take a considerable period of time.""</p> \n<p>Noto spoke alongside Twitter co-founder and interim CEO Jack Dorsey. Both men believe that Twitter's complexity has become an obstacle to further growth. Twitter has about 300 million users, less than a quarter as many as Facebook. Twitter's top brass think 300 million users isn't good enough; they want to revamp Twitter to make it easier to use, allowing it to reach a Facebook-size audience in the coming years.</p> \n<p>That sounds good in theory, but it could be disastrous in practice. Twitter is the power users' social network. It demands more from users of Facebook or Instagram, but users who master its complexities are able to sift through large volumes of online information more efficiently than they can with other social media tools. If Twitter tries to simplify its product, it risks alienating its existing users without attracting many new ones.</p> \n<h3>Popular technologies demand less of their users</h3> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""3917706"" alt=""1170790960_ab466caf70_o.0.jpg"" src=""https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3917706/1170790960_ab466caf70_o.0.jpg""></p> \n<p> </p> \n<p class=""caption"">PCs are computing devices for power users.

Geeks continue to use the Unix command line because — once you know how to use it — it's a powerful way to perform complex computing tasks.</p> \n<p>But most users don't need the power, complexity, or hassles of using a Unix command line, which is why it never caught on with ordinary users. Until recently, most people used Windows PCs or Macs with a more user-friendly graphical user interface. Lately people have been shifting toward even simpler computing technologies: smartphones and tablets. These mobile platforms provide fewer capabilities than a conventional PC — it's hard to write a blog post or manage a complex spreadsheet on an iPhone — but they're also easy to learn and demand little of users.</p> \n<p>The older, more complex computing platforms didn't die. Programmers still use Unix-based operating systems. Many white-collar professionals still use PCs. But for the average person, the complexity of a PC is more trouble than it's worth. So smartphones are becoming the most popular category of computer.</p> \n<h3>Facebook demands less of its users than Twitter does</h3> \n<p> </p> \n<p><span>A similar principle applies to social media technologies: The most popular services tend to be the ones that demand the least from their users. And Twitter demands a lot more of users than Facebook does.</span></p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""right""><span>Most people don't want to sift through large volumes of information</span></q></p> \n<p>To make Twitter manageable, you have to carefully curate the list of people you follow to avoid being overwhelmed. The rules for Twitter conversations — for example, the fact that starting a tweet with someone's username will hide it from anyone not already following that user — are not intuitive to someone dropping by the site for the first time, or even the 10th. And many users find it intimidating to write tweets that anyone in the world could read.</p> \n<p>Twitter helps users sift through a lot of information efficiently, which makes it invaluable for a media professional like me. But most people don't want to sift through large volumes of information. They just want to look at pictures of their friends' weddings, vacations, and babies with a minimum of hassle. And Facebook makes this really easy.</p> \n<h3>Why Twitter shouldn't try to become Facebook</h3> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""3917714"" alt=""GettyImages-467502684.0.jpg"" src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3917714/GettyImages-467502684.0.jpg""></p> \n<p> </p> \n<p class=""caption"">Jack Dorsey might have to just accept that Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg is going to have a more popular website. (Josh Edelson/AFP/Getty Images)</p> \n<div><br></div> \n<p><span>Twitter is under pressure to expand its audience so it can generate the kind of revenues and profits Facebook does. But there are good reasons to think this won't work — and that trying to make it work might destroy the site in the process.</span></p> \n<p>Microsoft's struggles to adapt to the mobile revolution provide an instructive analogy. For years, Microsoft has been struggling to produce a version of its Windows operating system that works well on tablets. The result has often been products that occupy an awkward middle ground — neither as powerful as a full-scale Windows PC nor as user-friendly as an iPad. It's hard to reduce the complexity of a Windows PC without simultaneously eliminating features that make it useful. After several flops, Microsoft has finally achieved <a href=""http://www.theverge.com/2015/7/21/9010403/microsoft-earnings-report-q4-2015"">modest success</a> with the Surface Pro 3, but Windows-based tablets are still a lot less popular than iPads and Android tablets.</p> \n<p>A similar point applies to social networks. Twitter's complexity isn't just a problem the company needs to eliminate, it's an essential part of what makes the site useful right now. Twitter facilitates a type of rich, open conversation that's much harder to have on a more restrictive platform like Facebook or Instagram. It's why its most committed users are so incredibly committed, and why they create so much valuable, free content for the service.</p> \n<p>While more complex products tend to be less popular in relative terms, they can still be huge markets in absolute terms. Microsoft is a hugely profitable company because it can continue selling its products to businesses that need the power of a full-scale PC. Similarly, the rapid growth of Facebook and Instagram doesn't mean that Twitter is doomed; there will continue to be tens or even hundreds of millions of people who want to use Twitter.</p> \n<p>Twitter's problem is that it hasn't found a way to monetize its relatively small but highly engaged and influential audience. Microsoft makes a lot of money from every Windows license it sells, so it doesn't matter that people buy fewer PCs than mobile devices. But advertisers don't seem willing to pay more to advertise to a Twitter user than a Facebook user. So Twitter's smaller audience has translated to a lot less money in the bank.</p> \n<p>But 300 million users is still a lot, and it includes a lot of prominent and wealthy people. Rather than risk alienating its existing users in an effort to become more like Facebook, Twitter might want to focus on generating more revenue from the users it has.</p>",Business & Finance
This chart shows why robots aren't about to steal all our jobs,http://www.vox.com/2015/7/30/9069003/chart-robot-job-steal,There are far too few industrial robots to make a meaningful impact on global employment.,"<p>There's been a lot of media discussion recently of robots taking humans' jobs. A Gartner report last year <a href=""http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/smart-robots-will-take-third-jobs-2025-gartner-says/"">claimed</a> that ""one in three jobs will be converted to software, robots and smart machines by 2025."" Obviously it's impossible to know what will happen in the future. But one sign that robots aren't having much of an impact on the livelihood of workers today comes from <a href=""http://www.ifr.org/industrial-robots/statistics/"">this chart</a> from the International Federation of Robotics:</p> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""3918260""><img src=""https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3918260/RTEmagicC_estimated_shipments_IR.png.png""></div> \n<p>The first thing to notice about this chart is that the numbers are tiny. Manufacturers shipped a record number of robots in 2013, but the total number of robots shipped worldwide — 178,000 — is <span>surprisingly small</span>. In a global labor market with billions of workers, that just isn't enough robots to have much of an effect.</p> \n<p>The same is true if you focus on the United States. In North America, factories ordered 23,700 industrial robots in 2013, a tiny fraction of the <a href=""http://www.nam.org/Newsroom/Facts-About-Manufacturing/"">12 million workers</a> in America's manufacturing sector or the roughly 1 million new workers the US economy adds each year.</p> \n<p>The second thing to notice about this chart is the surprisingly slow growth of robot shipments. About 70,000 robots were shipped in 1995. After 18 years, the figure was only about 2.5 times larger.</p> \n<p>The IFR predicts that growth is about to accelerate. It projects that robot shipments will reach 288,000 by 2017, which would represent an impressive 13 percent annual growth rate over four years. If that pace of growth occurred for a couple of decades, the world's workers could face a serious threat sometime in the 2030s. But right now, there just aren't enough industrial robots to have a significant effect on the job market.</p> \n<p><i>Thanks to <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://twitter.com/jamesbessen"">Jim Bessen</a> for pointing out this chart to me.</i></p> \n<p><b>Correction:</b> This post originally misstated the number of robots sold in the US in 2013.</p>",Business & Finance
Rick Perry just rolled out a surprisingly progressive agenda on Wall Street regulation,http://www.vox.com/2015/7/30/9072343/rick-perry-just-rolled-out-a-surprisingly-progressive-agenda-on-wall,Almost shockingly progressive for the very conservative former governor of Texas.,"<p>Rick Perry has a plan to change the way the federal government regulates Wall Street, and it is … kind of left-wing. Almost shockingly so for the very conservative former governor of Texas.</p> \n<p>He laid out <a href=""https://rickperry.org/reforming-wall-street"">his plan </a>in a Wednesday speech. He hit on many familiar conservative themes, but also some not-so-familiar ones. For example, he credited Texas's relatively strong weathering of the Great Recession in part to strict financial regulation. ""But there’s another thing we have in Texas that the rest of the country could learn from,"" he said. ""We regulate, in an intelligent way, the use of a type of mortgage called 'cash-out refinancing.'""</p> \n<p>The Perry campaign does not have a ton of specific details to offer about his ideas, and financial regulation is certainly an area in which the devil is frequently in the details. But in broad strokes, Perry has some pretty good ideas combined with a standard Republican aversion to any kind of consumer financial protection. His proposals are aimed, overwhelmingly, at reducing the amount of debt in the financial system both by regulating big banks and by reducing the tendency of federal programs to encourage middle-class households to borrow heavily to buy houses. The total impact would be a financial system that is considerably less fragile, albeit one in which it is also easier for financial firms to make a quick buck by pulling the wool over consumers' eyes.</p> \n<h3>Rick Perry calls for something like Glass-Steagall</h3> \n<p>The headline here is that Perry comes close to calling for a breakup of big multi-line financial conglomerates, with his fact sheet saying that ""requiring banks to separate their commercial lending and investment banking practices should be considered."" This is something liberals have made a lot of noise about since the financial crisis, and that Hillary Clinton has declined to endorse even as Martin O'Malley and Bernie Sanders have. But Perry's backup idea — ""alternatively, require these banks to hold a significant additional capital cushion for their trading activities"" — is probably a better idea.</p> \n<p>What this means is that Perry would make a more complicated bank be more cautious about borrowing money than a similarly sized but less-complicated entity would have to be.</p> \n<p>This would make complexity less profitable and create a financial incentive to shrink and simplify unless you're really reaping massive efficiency gains. At the same time, it would ensure that a complicated bank is especially unlikely to go bust — and thus that difficult questions about how to deal with the failure of such a bank are unlikely to arise.</p> \n<h3>Perry's other ideas are a mix of left and right</h3> \n<ul> \n<li>Perry says the Fed and Congress should move to further restrict the amount of borrowing that the largest and most systemically significant banks are allowed to engage in.</li> \n<li>Perry wants to weaken the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau by subjecting its budget to the annual congressional appropriations process rather than continuing to allow it to be automatically funded by the Federal Reserve.</li> \n<li>Perry wants to replace the Dodd-Frank bill's approach to resolving the failure of a large bank (which involves administrative action by regulators) with a new chapter of the bankruptcy code (he specifically cites <a href=""http://www.hoover.org/sites/default/files/bankruptcy-code-chapter-14-proposal-20120228.pdf"">this proposal from the Hoover Institution</a>) that would allow it to be handled through the judicial branch.</li> \n<li>Perry wants to exempt all community banks, all banks run as partnerships, and all asset management firms from Dodd-Frank regulations.</li> \n<li>Perry wants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/10/21/7027949/mel-watt-subprime-mortgage-fannie-mae-freddie-mac"">stop pushing for a revival of subprime mortgages</a> and to implement curbs on cash-out refinancing. </li> \n</ul> \n<h3>Rick Perry is going nowhere</h3> \n<p>Unfortunately for fans of ideologically unexpected financial regulation proposals, Perry's presidential campaign seems to be going nowhere fast. He's currently <a href=""http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/ia/iowa_republican_presidential_caucus-3194.html"">polling in ninth place in Iowa</a> and <a href=""http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/2016_republican_presidential_nomination-3823.html"">11th place nationally</a>, so these ideas have relatively little chance of impacting the course of national politics.</p> \n<p>Still, on paper Perry has considerable strength. With 14 years as governor of the nation's second-largest state on his résumé, he's about the most experienced candidate in the field. And he has <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/6/4/8725225/rick-perry-job-creation"">the best story of economic achievement</a> to tell of anyone in the race. His ideas on finance, meanwhile, seem to indicate that he's a more nuanced and creative thinker than his national reputation might suggest. But thus far, none of that is doing him any good.</p>",Business & Finance

There is good reason to believe that this will improve the accuracy of our understanding of the state of the economy, and that in the future we may find ourselves using GDO as our standard metric of economic activity. GDP itself is relatively new to the game, and used to be overshadowed by <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.auburn.edu/~johnspm/gloss/GNP"">gross n<em>ational</em> product</a>, so there's no reason to think it should reign supreme forever.

The <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.bea.gov/scb/account_articles/national/0897niw/box1.htm"">statistical discrepancy</a> is about equal to the entire economic output of <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.tradingeconomics.com/israel/gdp"">Israel</a> or <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.tradingeconomics.com/denmark/gdp"">Denmark</a>.

But if the government just forgot to count them in a survey, people would think it was a big problem.</p> \n<h3>Improving measurement with GDO</h3> \n<p>The problem is that while GDP and GDI are, in theory, identical in practice they are constructed by adding up data sets that, like all human endeavors, are measured by human beings. We can't measure household consumption perfectly and we can't measure workers' compensation perfectly either. In life, nothing is perfect.</p> \n<p>But just as you can improve your understanding of the state of public opinion by <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2014/06/06/primary-winner-poll-averages-prove-more-accurate/""><em>averaging</em> several polls</a> to reduce sampling error, by <em>averaging together</em> GDP and GDI you should be able to reduce the extent to which measurement error biases your estimate.</p> \n<p>Taking two different stabs at measuring the same thing and then <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.mathgoodies.com/lessons/vol8/mean.html"">averaging them together</a>, in other words, is more likely to get you close to the true quantity than taking either measurement approach alone.</p> \n<h3>Economics in the real world is hard</h3> \n<p>At a conference, an economist once observed to me that one problem with fancy economists with jobs at prestigious schools is that they get to spend all their time working with theoretical quantities. Less-fancy economists with less-fancy jobs need to spend more time working with the murky and often annoying process of actually assembling economic data.</p> \n<p>That can leave them more attuned to the practical policy problems that arise due to measurement error and ambiguity.</p> \n<p>For example, in 2009 the Obama administration and their friends in Congress outlined an <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.amazon.com/The-New-Deal-Hidden-Change-ebook/dp/B006JDFJO4"">economic stimulus package</a> that they thought would be roughly appropriate in size given the scale of the recession.

Had they been more mindful of the error-prone nature of initial data, they might have designed their legislative proposal somewhat differently.</p> \n<p>Another example is that the tax code provides for investment income to be taxed at a lower rate than labor income.</p> \n<p>This is supposed to encourage well-to-do people to save and invest in a way that encourages long-term economic growth rather than squandering their earnings on yachts and fancy cars. But it also creates a large incentive for people to simply find ways to classify their income as investment income. Thus the general partners in hedge, venture capital, and private equity funds managed to identify a legal loophole through which much of their management fees can be classified for tax purposes as investment gains.</p> \n<p>This costs the Treasury money, of course, but it also creates misleading official statistics — labor income vanishes and reappears as investment income even though nothing in the real world has changed.</p>",Business & Finance
"At last, a convincing theory about why the tech boom's days are numbered",http://www.vox.com/2015/7/31/9078717/startup-boom-end,"""Thereâ€™s just not enough 'stuff' to go around.""","<p>The technology boom of the 1990s ended in a spectacular wave of failure, as huge swaths of the sector proved to be based on fundamentally unsound business models.</p> \n<p>Today's business models look, on the whole, to be much stronger. And that's why I've never believed the dozens of people who've spent the past four years crying bubble. But <a href=""http://csen.tumblr.com/post/125460789699/silicon-valley-is-going-to-retrench-in-2016"">Conor Sen of New River Investments</a> has a very smart post making the point that the expansion cycle can fail for other reasons. In particular, he says, ""there’s just not enough 'stuff' to go around.""</p> \n<p>To keep growing, the technology sector needs to keep adding skilled workers and office space, and both San Francisco and Silicon Valley are running out of both. That means that even companies with perfectly plausible business ideas are going to find costs rising faster than revenue, and the sector is going to need to stall out until some companies fail and free up more resources for the others.</p> \n<h3>Nobody wants to rent to startups</h3> \n<p>Jason Freedman from the real estate website <a href=""https://42floors.com/blog/cre/landlords-are-trying-not-to-rent-startups"">42Floors has a fascinating observation</a> that could spell the end of the current cycle of expansion in the internet startup sector. It's not about an investment bubble or any problems with the basic product of any of today's startups. Instead, it's a funny observation about the commercial real estate market.</p> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""3922698""><img src=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3922698/Untitled.png""></div> \n<p>Office rents are skyrocketing and vacancy rates plummeting in San Francisco. But there's always more money.</p> \n<p>The real problem, he writes, is that many of the city's landlords ""are trying as hard as they can to get non-startup tenants right now. We at 42Floors recently experienced this firsthand when we were searching for our new office space.""</p> \n<p>And it's not about money. It's about <em>risk</em>. ""Landlords look at their tenants as a portfolio of revenue streams and risks,"" Freedman says, and they want to hedge against a possible bust in the startup market by making sure that they don't have a portfolio that's <em>too</em> crowded with internet startups. There comes a point when a landlord is willing to take a significant hit on the rent to be leasing to some lawyers or accountants or architects or anything that won't vanish if a wave of venture capital skepticism suddenly sweeps the country.</p> \n<h3>It's hard to leave the technology hub</h3> \n<p>Of course, your company always <em>could</em> try to leave the ultra-hot San Francisco/Silicon Valley real estate market in favor of someplace more affordable. There's plenty of office space for rent in Cleveland or Detroit and no problem building more in Phoenix or San Antonio.</p> \n<p>The problem is that almost any move you could make to mitigate your real estate problems is going to <em>exacerbate</em> your skilled labor problem.</p> \n<p>The reason is that startups are, inherently, risky places to work. But if you have the kind of skills to get a good job at a startup, you can greatly mitigate that risk by living in a city that's full of similar startups that need people with similar skills. You mitigate that risk, in other words, by living in Silicon Valley or San Francisco.</p> \n<p>Which means that if you're a company that needs startup workers, you're going to find that moving to Cleveland to avoid the Bay Area office crunch is going to leave you with a shortage of workers. Heck, even moving to <em>Oakland</em> is going to leave you with a shortage of workers since, at the end of the day, you'll be at a recruiting disadvantage vis-a-vis companies that can offer a more pleasant commute.</p> \n<h3>Nothing lasts forever</h3> \n<p>These supply constraints on the startup economy are, of course, surmountable, and given time they will be surmounted. <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/29/technology/code-academy-as-career-game-changer.html?_r=0"">More people are learning to code</a> to take advantage of job opportunities there, and smart companies are making efforts to be more attractive workplaces for a more diverse population in order to be able to draw on a broader talent base.</p> \n<p>But unless the Bay Area changes its attitude toward new building permits, the office space crunch will remain, and there will be a fundamental physical constraint on the number of people who can find housing in the technology hub.</p> \n<p>Rezoning would be the easiest fix but, in some ways, the most politically unlikely one. Breaking the bottleneck, then, will eventually require some new technology hubs to emerge in places that are more eager to embrace new construction. But until that happens — and it's difficult to pull off — the ""only so much stuff to go around"" problem will be with us, and technology booms will be somewhat self-limiting.</p>",Business & Finance
Wage inequality seems to be decreasing,http://www.vox.com/2015/8/1/9078825/wage-inequality,"Everyone's earnings are growing slowly, but it's worse for managers than for average workers.","<p>Here's a small sign that one of the drivers behind US income inequality may have reversed itself over the past few years.</p> \n<p>The chart below compares the hourly compensation of all private sector workers (in red) to the hourly compensation of just production<i> </i>and nonsupervisory (in blue) private sector workers:</p> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""3923704"" alt=""fredgraph.0.png"" src=""https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3923704/fredgraph.0.png""></p> \n<p>What this chart shows is that although wage growth has been generally slow since the start of the recession in 2007, wage growth for the bottom 80 percent (the blue line) has actually been a little bit <i>faster</i> than wage growth for all workers (the red). The wage gap between managers and non-managers, in other words, is narrowing.*</p> \n<p>That doesn't mean that overall income inequality is declining, however. Rich people also tend to have investment income from owning financial assets such as stocks and bonds, and very rich people — almost by definition — own a <i>lot</i> of financial assets. These asset prices have recovered from the recession more robustly than wages, thus creating a whole different source of inequality. But wage inequality was a major force in the 1980s and 1990s, and the news that it seems to have gone into reverse is interesting and important.</p> \n<p>* <i>Note: </i><span>The ""all workers"" data set only goes back to 2006, so we can't do any useful historical analysis of this. But the ""production and nonsupervisory"" series goes back to 1964, and we know it covers about 80 percent of the workforce. We also know that average pay in the ""all workers"" series is higher, which makes sense since the other 20 percent is composed of managers and supervisors.</span></p>",Business & Finance
"This CEO gave his lowest-paid employees huge raises, and it made some people angry",http://www.vox.com/2015/8/1/9084071/ceo-raise-angry,Employee compensation is an emotional issue.,"<p>Three months ago, a Seattle businessman had an epiphany. Dan Price, the CEO and co-owner of Gravity Payments, concluded that everyone in the company — including him — would be happier if he took a big pay cut and used the money to give his lowest-paid employees big raises. So he instituted a new policy where within three years, every employee in the company would make at least $70,000 per year. For some employees, that meant tens of thousands of dollars in raises.</p> \n<p>You might think this was a win-win situation for everyone. A bunch of employees got raises. Price thought he'd get more satisfaction from helping his employees than from making more money himself. No one else's salary went down.</p> \n<p>But as the New York Times reports, the plan <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/02/business/a-company-copes-with-backlash-against-the-raise-that-roared.html?hp&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;module=second-column-region&amp;region=top-news&amp;WT.nav=top-news"">made a lot of people upset</a>. Most upset were employees who were already making salaries near the new $70,000 minimum. They felt that giving formerly much lower-paid employees the same salary as them deprived them of their status as highly paid employees. Two employees even quit in protest after the raises were announced.</p> \n<p>Also upset were some of Price's peers in the business community. They felt the $70,000 salary minimum was unrealistic, and they worried that they'd now face pressures for higher wages from their own employees.</p> \n<h3>Employee compensation is an emotional issue</h3> \n<p>The lesson here is that employee compensation is a lot more than a coldly rational calculation of costs and benefits. Financially speaking, it doesn't hurt one worker when another worker gets a raise. But in practice, people's salaries are seen as a key way employers communicate approval of their subordinates. It doesn't feel good if your co-worker gets a raise and you don't.</p> \n<p>And that's especially true if employees feel the pay structure doesn't recognize the contributions of a company's longest-serving and hardest-working employees. One person who felt this way at Gravity Payments was Maisey McMaster, a 26-year-old who ""joined the company five years ago and worked her way up to financial manager, putting in long hours that left little time for her husband and extended family.""</p> \n<p>McMaster feels that by only raising salaries for workers at the bottom of the pay scale, Price failed to properly recognize workers like her who had devoted years to building the company. She left after the raises were announced. She told the Times that Price ""gave raises to people who have the least skills and are the least equipped to do the job, and the ones who were taking on the most didn’t get much of a bump.""</p>",Business & Finance
Amazon has a plan for thousands of drones to fill the sky,http://www.vox.com/2015/8/3/9090829/amazon-drone-plan,"Amazon wants to carve out a new section of the airspace for small, autonomous vehicles.","<p>When Amazon <a href=""http://www.cbsnews.com/news/amazons-jeff-bezos-looks-to-the-future/"">gave <i>60 Minutes</i> a sneak peek</a> at its drone delivery plans in 2013, it was easy to imagine that it was just a publicity stunt. The announcement was the day before Cyber Monday, the unofficial start of the holiday shopping season online. And the idea of drones delivering packages seemed a bit like science fiction.</p> \n<p>But last week came the <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jul/28/amazon-autonomous-drones-only-airspace-package-delivery"">latest sign</a> that Amazon is deadly serious about getting into the drone delivery business. In a <a href=""https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2182312-amazon-determining-safe-access-with-a-best.html"">pair</a> of brief <a href=""https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2182311-amazon-revising-the-airspace-model-for-the-safe.html"">white papers</a> released at a <a href=""http://utm.arc.nasa.gov/utm2015.shtml"">NASA conference</a> in Silicon Valley, Amazon laid out its vision for regulations that would govern a world where thousands — perhaps millions — of drones buzzed over American cities every day.</p> \n<h3>Ubiquitous drones will require new rules and infrastructure</h3> \n<p>Drone technology today is in a similar place to automotive technology in the early 20th century. Cars existed back then, but were still a niche technology limited to hobbyists and rich people. There were so few cars that the rules and infrastructure that support cars today — stoplights, speed limits, controlled-access freeways, parking laws, and so forth — mostly weren't needed. That changed as cars became mainstream.</p> \n<p>Amazon thinks we're on the cusp of a similar transition with drones. The e-commerce giant believes — or hopes — that there will be exponentially more drones in the sky in a decade than there are today. And the company is advocating new rules to ensure that those drones don't crash into each other, or into conventional planes, birds, or other obstacles.</p> \n<p>Amazon's vision for drone traffic management looks like this:</p> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""3931048""><img src=""https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3931048/Screen%20Shot%202015-08-03%20at%2011.41.36%20AM.png""></div> \n<p>Above 500 feet is ""integrated airspace,"" where conventional aircraft fly today. Current regulations place strict limits on flights below that. But Amazon wants to carve out a zone between 200 and 400 feet for a new class of small, autonomous, unmanned vehicles — like Amazon delivery drones.</p> \n<p>To prevent crashes, Amazon would establish high technical standards for vehicles that use this new airspace. Autonomous drones would need a GPS and highly accurate geospatial data, a reliable internet connection, the ability to communicate wirelessly with other drones, and sensors to detect and avoid collisions with other objects in the sky.</p> \n<p>The result could be a dramatic transformation of the space above us. Right now, people see an occasional airplane or helicopter overhead — usually thousands of feet in the air. But in the future, drones buzzing overhead could be as commonplace as cars driving on a nearby street. And Amazon hopes that many of those vehicles will be owned by Amazon and delivering packages to customers in less than an hour.</p>",Business & Finance
One sentence that explains why Obama is struggling to finish his big trade deal,http://www.vox.com/2015/8/4/9094507/trans-pacific-partnership-sentence,One of the biggest sticking points has little to do with trade â€” it's about a rule to benefit big US drug companies.,"<p>The <a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/trans-pacific-partnership"">Trans-Pacific Partnership</a>, a trade deal the United States is negotiating with 11 other Pacific Rim nations, is a big, complicated document. But if you want to boil the fight over the deal down to its essence, it would be hard to do better than <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/04/business/international/trans-pacific-partnership-session-ends-with-heels-dug-in.html"">this sentence from Jonathan Weisman</a> at the New York Times, discussing why last week's negotiations in Hawaii didn't produce a deal:</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>Virtually all of the parties hated American protections of pharmaceutical firms, but a compromise on that issue could cost the support of Republicans in Congress.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>This is referring to ""data exclusivity,"" an obscure but important provision of US pharmaceutical regulations. If the US gets other countries to adopt its approach, it could lead to less competition and higher prices for medicine in other TPP nations.</p> \n<p>Before a company can introduce a new drug, it must convince the Food and Drug Administration that it's safe and effective. To prove that, companies conduct expensive clinical trials. Sometimes a second company will develop a drug that's chemically similar to an earlier drug and will want to use data from the first company's clinical trials in its own application. But for an important class of drugs called <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopharmaceutical"">biologics</a>, US law bars companies from doing this for 12 years, forcing these generic drugmakers to either do their own, redundant clinical trials or to wait until that period is over.</p> \n<p>The US is trying to use the TPP to export this system to other Pacific Rim nations, most of which have data exclusivity periods for biologics of five or eight years. That would mean higher drug prices around the world, which is why <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/7/18/8994897/tpp-deal-health"">public health groups like Doctors without Borders hate it</a>.</p> \n<p>Even the Obama administration — at least the part of the administration in charge of writing the president's budget proposals — <a href=""http://www.fiercebiotech.com/story/obama-administration-looks-chop-back-market-exclusivity-biologics/2014-03-06"">thinks US law is too generous to drug companies</a>. The administration has proposed reducing data exclusivity from 12 years to seven here in the United States, even as it pushes for treaty language pushing the rest of the world in the opposite direction.</p> \n<p>The broader point here is that while the TPP is usually described as a trade deal, President Obama and his (mostly Republican) allies in Congress are making it clear that freer trade isn't necessarily their highest priority. The deal is widely seen as a vehicle for doing favors for special interests in the United States — some of which have only a tenuous connection to trade.</p>",Business & Finance

Because such enforcement by state and local agencies for these crimes sometimes is erratic or nonexistent, the declining role of the federal government could be of great significance.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>The long list of the crimes included in the definition of white-collar crime includes such a wide range of activities that multiple federal agencies are involved. The below (poorly colored) pie chart shows that going after white-collar crime isn't a challenge of any single agency:</p> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""3942504""><img src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3942504/Screen%20Shot%202015-08-05%20at%207.34.44%20AM.png""></div> \n<p><!--  ########  BEGIN SNIPPET  ########  --></p> \n<div data-analytics-category=""article"" data-analytics-action=""link:related"" class=""chorus-snippet s-related"">\n<span class=""s-related__title"">Related</span> <!-- Add links here --><a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/4/15/8420789/elizabeth-warren-prosecutions"" target=""_blank"">Elizabeth Warren has a game-changing idea that doesn’t require Congress</a><em style=""font-family: Helvetica, Arial, 'Nimbus Sans L', sans-serif; font-size: 19.5px; line-height: 35.75px;""> </em>\n</div> \n<h3>9/11 seems to have driven a decline in federal prosecutions</h3> \n<p>As mentioned earlier, it's possible that the drop in white-collar prosecution is partly a matter of recording which local, state, and federal entities prosecute white-collar crime.</p> \n<p>A significant portion of the total decline is seen in the records of the biggest single federal agency to prosecute these offenses — the FBI. As TRAC reported in 2013, the FBI's prosecutions alone dropped from nearly 5,000 in 1993 to 3,000 by 2013, accounting for a large portion of the total decline in white-collar prosecutions recorded thus far in 2015.</p> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""3942518""><img src=""https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3942518/Screen%20Shot%202015-08-05%20at%207.50.41%20AM.png""></div> \n<p>A dramatic downward trend begins, as shown above, in 2002 and likely relates to the rising salience of terrorism as an FBI mission.

Redfin set out to change real estate. Then real estate changed Redfin.,http://www.vox.com/2015/8/10/9110233/redfin-glenn-kelman-profile,"""Real estate is by far the most screwed up industry in America,"" CEO Glenn Kelman said in 2007. Now he says he ""can't walk around with a swagger and talk about destroying an industry.""","<p>""Real estate is by far the most screwed up industry in America,"" Glenn Kelman declared in a <a href=""http://www.cbsnews.com/news/chipping-away-at-realtors-six-percent-11-05-2007/"" target=""_blank"">2007 interview</a> on <i>60 Minutes</i>. Kelman, the CEO of the online real estate company Redfin, was following the familiar script of a disruptive internet startup. ""We feel like things that Amazon or eBay or Yahoo have done for other industries, we can do for the real estate industry,"" he said.</p> \n<p>Redfin showed homes for sale on an interactive map — a fairly new concept in 2007. And it had an equally novel business model: a do-it-yourself real estate service that let customers buy houses for a third of the cost of  a conventional agent.</p> \n<p>You know how this story is supposed to turn out: The startup upends the old way of doing things, driving established competitors out of business. But that's not what happened. Over the next few years, Redfin was forced — slowly and reluctantly — to operate more like a conventional realty company. As Redfin beefed up its service, it charged more too. Today, Redfin owes its success as much to adapting to conventional real estate practices as to defying them.</p> \n<p>When I met with Kelman at Vox headquarters in April, he spoke with the same quiet intensity as the man who denounced the real estate industry on national television eight years earlier. He still believes Redfin is changing the real estate industry for the better — and that Redfin's unique business model allows it to do things other technology and real estate companies can't. But the gospel Kelman is preaching today is more nuanced than the David-and-Goliath tale he told nearly a decade ago.</p> \n<p>""I can't walk around with a swagger and talk about destroying an industry,"" he told me. ""I am more confident than ever that this change that we're creating is going to continue and accelerate. But if that means that some other real estate agent at some other brokerage has a tougher time making a living, that's not a reason for me to throw a party.""</p> \n<p>A lot of early internet companies, including Yahoo, Google, and Facebook, were online-only operations. But as the internet becomes ever more deeply embedded in our daily lives, companies that straddle the line between the physical and online worlds will become ever more important. Redfin doesn't have as many users as online-only competitors Zillow and Trulia. But in some ways it's having a bigger impact on the real estate industry.</p> \n<p>""To change the game, sometimes you have to learn the game,"" Kelman told me. ""To affect the real world, you have to be in the real world.""</p> \n<h3>A different shopping experience</h3> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""3946816"" alt=""Screen_Shot_2015-08-06_at_1.05.42_PM.0.png"" src=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3946816/Screen_Shot_2015-08-06_at_1.05.42_PM.0.png""></p> \n<p> </p> \n<p class=""caption"">Putting real estate listings on a map was the original innovation of Redfin.

""Their agents are very knowledgeable and responsive, but they are not going to hand-hold you through finding houses to view.""</p> \n<p>As a type-A person myself, that sounded pretty good to me. I'm good at finding and organizing information on the internet, so I didn't feel like I needed a lot of hand-holding.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""center""><span>""I can't walk around with a swagger and talk about destroying an industry""</span></q></p> \n<p>Yet our Redfin experience wasn't actually that different from the experience we would have had with a conventional realtor. We were assigned an agent named Thomas, who took us on our first home tour. He answered questions about the home-buying process and encouraged us to keep looking until we found a property we wanted to buy. Later tours were performed by other agents, but Thomas was always available to answer questions and guide us through the process of making offers.</p> \n<p>If we'd been shopping for a home back in 2007, when Redfin first entered the Washington, DC, market, we would have gotten a more extreme do-it-yourself experience. Back then, Redfin charged customers $250 to go on a home tour — if they had agents available to show the property at all.</p> \n<p>Back then, Kelman thought customers would jump at the chance to do most of the work themselves and pocket thousands of dollars in extra savings. He was wrong.</p> \n<p>The early Redfin business model attracted a small, hardcore fan base, but it gradually became clear that it wouldn't go further than that. The per-tour fee stressed people out. Also, first-time homebuyers have a lot of questions that Redfin wasn't really set up to answer. When Redfin surveyed its customers, the feedback was clear: They wanted to be able to tour more homes and ask more questions, even if the service cost more.</p> \n<h3>Redfin shifts to a full-service model</h3> \n<p>""We didn't want to show houses because we knew it would take a decade to hire all these people,"" Kelman told me. ""And we knew the shape of the business's profits would be a lot different.""</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""right""><span>""Redfin started life as a cult, but our goal has always been to become a religion""</span></q></p> \n<p>The most successful internet companies exploit the fact that computers are cheap and human labor is expensive. For example, because almost all of Facebook's interactions with users are automated, a few thousand employees can serve a billion users. The more labor-intensive Redfin's service became, the slower and more arduous it would be to grow it and eventually turn a profit.</p> \n<p>This is probably why Zillow and Trulia, which were founded around the same time and also displayed real estate listings on a map — never copied Redfin's brokerage model. They just ran websites and charged traditional real estate agents for referrals. That low-overhead approach allowed Zillow and Trulia to grow rapidly — today Zillow is the market leader with almost <a href=""http://www.realtor.org/sites/default/files/reports/2015/nar-website-traffic-stats-january2015.pdf"">10 times as many users</a> as Redfin.</p> \n<p>But by 2008 Redfin was already in the brokerage business. And it had become clear that the original, bare-bones brokerage model would never appeal to a mass audience. So in November 2008, as the real estate market was imploding, Redfin <a href=""https://www.redfin.com/blog/2008/11/our_shot_at_the_mass_market.html#.VagqbSpVhBc"">took the plunge</a>.</p> \n<p>""Redfin started life as a cult,"" Kelman wrote on the Redfin blog. ""But our goal has always been to become a religion.""</p> \n<p>Shifting to a full-service model required hiring a lot more real estate agents. And that, in turn, would cost money. Traditionally, a buyer's agent gets 3 percent of the sale price. Before, Redfin had kept 1 percent of the sale price and rebated the other 2 percent to customers. Now it was keeping 1.5 percent, a 50 percent increase.</p> \n<p>In 2012, Redfin <a href=""https://www.redfin.com/blog/2012/02/introducing_redfin_30_redfin_becomes_a_no-brainer_introducing_redfin_30_redfin_becomes_a_no-brainer.html#.VbhZ2CpVhBc"">beefed up its service again</a>, hiring 50 more agents so it could reduce each one's workload and give agents time to get to know customers personally. Once again, the improved service came with a higher price. Today, Redfin often keeps more than 2 percent of a home's sale price, rebating less than 1 percent to the customer.</p> \n<h3>Buying a house isn't like ordering a book or an airplane ticket</h3> \n<p>Buying a house isn't like other consumer purchases. I can order a book or an airline ticket in minutes. By contrast, I spent months poring over housing listings to find the perfect property. And because I'd never purchased a house before, I had a lot of questions that I wanted a human being to answer.</p> \n<p>And after almost a decade in the business, Redfin still hasn't automated many key steps in the home-buying process. For example, the company doesn't offer an automated way to get estimates of home values — when we needed guidance on how much to offer for a property, we emailed our Redfin agent for a personalized estimate. That's probably because publicly available data on homes is unreliable — Zillow offers a ""Zestimate"" of home values, but these figures are <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/where-we-live/wp/2014/06/10/how-accurate-is-zillows-zestimate-not-very-says-one-washington-area-agent/"">not very reliable</a>.</p> \n<p>Similarly, Redfin has done little to change the process of making an offer on a home. It does use a service that lets customers sign PDF documents online. But the documents themselves get filled out by Redfin agents and sent to customers by email — there was no way for me to prepare an offer on my own.</p> \n<p>Ultimately, real estate has proved less prone to disruption than other industries that have been transformed by digital technology. At first glance, it strikes some people as outrageous that someone could earn more than $10,000 to help someone buy a house.  But when Redfin offered customers a radically cheaper alternative, most of them didn't want it. Buying a home is the biggest financial decision most homeowners will ever make, and so most customers are willing to pay a premium to make sure they don't make a mistake.</p> \n<h3>Why Redfin has a better chance to disrupt home selling</h3> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""3946792"" alt=""20140809_151355_resized.0.jpg"" src=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3946792/20140809_151355_resized.0.jpg""></p> \n<p> </p> \n<p class=""caption"">(Timothy B. Lee/Vox)</p> \n<p> </p> \n<p>In its early years, Redfin was more popular among buyers than sellers. Kelman says there are a couple of good reasons for this. One is that Redfin's original innovation — putting real estate listings on a map — was targeted at buyers. Also, sellers are older, on average, than buyers, and therefore less likely to take a risk on an untested new online realty service.</p> \n<p>But more recently, Redfin has attracted a significant number of sellers. And Kelman sees that as a big opportunity.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""center""><span>""Uber could have waited for self-driving cars, but they didn't""</span></q></p> \n<p>""When you sell a house, you're the one who gets to make the rules for how it's going to be sold,"" Kelman says. Sellers decide how homes are presented online, when and how offers are accepted, and more. The power of sellers meant that Redfin had limited opportunity to innovate when it was primarily a website for homebuyers. But now that Redfin is representing a lot of sellers, it gets more say in how homes are sold.</p> \n<p>Redfin now discounts more aggressively on the seller's side of the market than on the buyer's side. The company generally takes a commission of more than 2 percent when it represents a buyer. For sellers, it takes 1.5 percent, and in Washington, DC, it is experimenting with charging just 1 percent — a third of the 3 percent fee many real estate agents charge sellers.</p> \n<p>Redfin has also <a href=""https://www.redfin.com/blog/2014/08/introducing-redfin-3d-walkthrough.html#.VbfkKipVhBc"">invested in technology</a> to show 3D walk-throughs of homes it's trying to sell.</p> \n<p>And while he refuses to provide details, Kelman hints that Redfin is working on other ways to improve the home-selling experience. He points out that in Australia, for example, homes are more often sold in auctions. It would be hard for a conventional realtor to conduct an online home auction, but Redfin's broad audience of potential buyers might give it a unique opportunity to experiment with different approaches.</p> \n<h3>""The business has become very explicable to investors""</h3> \n<p>Redfin may or may not be changing the real estate industry, but it's thriving as a business. In December, the company <a href=""https://www.google.com/search?sourceid=chrome-psyapi2&amp;rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS503US503&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=redfin%20raise%2070%20million&amp;oq=redfin%20raise%2070%20million&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57.6498j0j4"">raised $70 million</a> to fund expansion into new markets. That's on top of $95 million the company received in earlier fundraising rounds.</p> \n<div class=""align-right""> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""3946944"" alt=""redfin-markets-400x287-dots.0.png"" src=""https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3946944/redfin-markets-400x287-dots.0.png""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Redfin has operations in 36 states and the District of Columbia (Redfin)</p> \n</div> \n<p>Redfin has long aspired to be a national brand, but until recently it was limited to a handful of major metropolitan areas. Redfin's labor-intensive business model meant that expanding into new markets was an expensive proposition, and it took a while to demonstrate that the investment was worth it. But now Kelman says they've done it.</p> \n<p>""The business has become very explicable to investors,"" Kelman says. ""Anyone can understand how long it's going to take us to build share, what the profit from that market will be. And once you have that understanding, it's very straightforward to get capital.""</p> \n<p>The latest capital infusion has allowed Redfin to add more than two dozen new markets since the start of the year. The company now serves more than 70 markets overall. Recent additions have included <a href=""https://www.redfin.com/blog/2015/07/redfin-now-has-real-estate-agents-in-el-paso-corpus-christi-and-the-rio-grande-valley.html"">El Paso, Texas</a>; <a href=""https://www.redfin.com/blog/2015/07/redfin-agents-have-arrived-in-reno.html#.VbfrfSpVhBc"">Reno, Nevada</a>; and <a href=""https://www.redfin.com/blog/2015/06/redfin-arrives-in-dayton-ohio-and-little-rock-arkansas.html"">Dayton, Ohio</a>.</p> \n<p>There's a danger that bulking up will harm Redfin's ability to innovate. The larger Redfin's staff is, the harder it will be for new innovations to percolate throughout the company's nationwide workforce, and the more challenging it will be to keep standards of customer service high.</p> \n<p>But Kelman argues that Redfin's growing staff of real estate agents will let it innovate in ways that a purely virtual company couldn't. He draws a parallel to Uber and Lyft, two other technology companies whose services depend on large workforces. ""You could argue that Lyft or Uber isn't disruptive because you still have a human being driving a car,"" he says. ""Uber could have waited for self-driving cars. But they didn't, and I don't know many people who aren't glad.""</p> \n<p>We're used to thinking of the internet and the physical world as different domains. But in a world where everyone has the internet in their pocket, the biggest opportunities may be for businesses that have a foot in each world, using digital technology to make a conventional service faster, cheaper, or better.</p> \n<p><b>Correction:</b> I misattributed a real estate agent's critique of Zillow that <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/where-we-live/wp/2014/06/10/how-accurate-is-zillows-zestimate-not-very-says-one-washington-area-agent/"" target=""_blank"">appeared in the Washington Post</a> to the Washington Post itself.</p>",Business & Finance

You can book airplane tickets and hotel reservations using Expedia, Travelocity, Orbitz, Priceline, Hotels.com, Hotwire, and Kayak, among many other sites.

But earlier this year, <a href=""http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/01/23/us-expedia-m-a-idUSKBN0KW2DB20150123"">Expedia bought Travelocity</a>, reducing competition down to three big companies. Now Expedia wants to acquire Orbitz, which could give Expedia control of as much as 75 percent of the online travel booking market in the United States and only one major competitor.</p> \n<p>As the Washington Post's Brian Fung <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2015/08/06/booking-a-hotel-online-may-soon-get-more-expensive-hotels-warn/"">notes</a>, the hotel industry is lobbying the government to stop the deal. And federal regulators could block the transaction using antitrust laws. The question is whether critics can convince them that the deal would be bad for consumers.</p> \n<p>This is a market where size really matters; the larger Expedia gets, the more leverage it has in negotiations with hotels, airlines, and others who provide travel services. Hotels fear that Expedia's growing share of online bookings will allow the company to charge providers larger booking fees — fees that hotels will ultimately pass along to customers.</p> \n<p>And this is a relatively mature industry, so it won't be easy for new companies to build competing sites. Google has recently <a href=""http://techcrunch.com/2014/01/13/google-said-to-take-on-kayak-skyscanner-and-others-with-its-own-airfare-comparison-tool/"">shown some interest</a> in the market, but so far <a href=""http://www.eyefortravel.com/social-media-and-marketing/google-talking-straight-or-skirting-issues"">has chosen not to compete directly</a> with Priceline and Expedia by offering online bookings. So if the government lets Expedia buy Orbitz, we could wind up with an online travel duopoly for the foreseeable future. That could be bad for both the travel industry and travelers.</p>",Business & Finance

The automation myth,http://www.vox.com/2015/7/27/9038829/automation-myth,"Faster-than-ever technological and economic change is a myth. In fact, productivity is slowing down â€” and that's the biggest problem we face.","Over the past five years, American politics has become obsessed with robots. <div class=""chorus-snippet center""> \n<p>President Obama has <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIBhg1v4bMo"" target=""new"">warned</a> that ATMs and airport check-in kiosks are contributing to high unemployment. Sen. Marco Rubio <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/7/8/8911251/marco-rubio-jobs-speech"" target=""new"">said</a> that the central challenge of our times is ""to ensure that the rise of the machines is not the fall of the worker."" A <a href=""http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2015/07/world-without-work/395294/"" target=""new"">cover story</a> in the Atlantic asked us to ponder the problems of a world without work. And in the New York Times, <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/17/books/review/rise-of-the-robots-and-shadow-work.html"" target=""new"">Barbara Ehrenrich</a> warns that ""the job-eating maw of technology now threatens even the nimblest and most expensively educated.""</p> \n<p>The good news is that these concerns are wrong. None of the recent problems in the American economy are due to robots — or, to be more specific about it, due to an accelerating pace of automation. Moreover, even if the pace of automation does speed up in the future, there's no real reason to believe that it will be a problem.</p> \n<p>The bad news is that these concerns are wrong. Rather than an accelerating pace of automation, we've actually been living through a <em>slowdown</em> in the pace of productivity growth. And that slowdown is a huge problem. Unless it reverses, we'll be waking up soon to find ourselves in a depressing world of longer working years, unmanageable health-care needs, higher taxes, and a public sector starved of needed infrastructure resources.</p> \n<p>In other words, don't worry that the robots will take your job. Be terrified that they won't.</p> \n<h3>The past of automation</h3> \n<p>When people hear about robots, they think of science fiction — the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGi6j2VrL0o"">Johnny Cab taxi from <i>Total Recall</i></a>, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbLTYru5Y70"">chrome maid Rosie from <i>The Jetsons</i></a>, or the thinking, talking computer that powers the starship Enterprise. All this and more may come to pass some day (who knows?) but the reality of day-to-day change is more mundane.</p> \n<div class=""align-right""><img data-chorus-asset-id=""3906388"" alt=""constructionrobot.0.gif"" src=""https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3906388/constructionrobot.0.gif""></div> \n<p>Machines have been replacing humans for hundreds of years. And when it happens to you, it stinks. It stank for small business owners whose photo development shops were driven out of business by digital cameras. It stank for analog graphic designers like my mother who were disemployed by desktop publishing software in the late 1980s. It stank for stevedores who were put out of work by container ships. It stank for weavers put out of work by the spinning jenny. It stank for railroad engineers put out of work by the automobile.</p> \n<p>But for society as a whole<em>,</em> these were huge leaps forward. Specific individuals did in fact lose jobs and oftentimes ended up with lower wages. But on average, job growth continued and living standards rose.</p> \n<p>The techno-pessimists often admit this. The problem, they say, is if technology reduces the need for human labor <em>really, really</em> fast, then society won't have time to adjust, and there will be broad unemployment.</p> \n<p>Well, again, we can look to the past. Despite the cliché that technology today is progressing faster than ever, the per-worker output of the American economy actually increased at its fastest-ever rate in the quarter century between 1948 and 1973.</p> \n<p>This is the period in which the spread of refrigerators put milkmen out of work, while the initial adoption of machines to wash clothing and dishes rendered full-time household servants superfluous for the middle class. This was a time when television displaced live theater, and when truck-based delivery upended product distribution networks and rendered many neighborhood retailers obsolete. New interstates bypassed old towns and rail depots. Automatic telephone switches put operators out of work. New fertilizer products derived from wartime research increased per-acre crop yields and reduced the number of laborers needed.</p> \n<p>So what happened?</p> \n<p> </p> \n<div id=""average-hours-worked-per-year-per-worker-in-the-us__graphic"" data-analytics-viewport=""autotune"" data-analytics-class=""embed""></div> \n<p> \n<script src=""//apps.voxmedia.com/at-preview/average-hours-worked-per-year-per-worker-in-the-us/javascripts/pym-bca72f6d.js"" type=""text/javascript""></script> \n<script type=""text/javascript""><!-- \nnew pym.Parent('average-hours-worked-per-year-per-worker-in-the-us__graphic', '//apps.voxmedia.com/at-preview/average-hours-worked-per-year-per-worker-in-the-us/', {xdomain: '.*\\.voxmedia\\.com'}); \n// --></script> \n</p> \n<p> </p> \n<p>Well, people worked less. In 1950 (the first year for which we have records), the average employed person in the United States worked about 1,909 hours. By 1973, that had fallen to 1,797 hours. That's a decline of about 6 percent. It's the equivalent of going from having two weeks of paid vacation per year to having five weeks. Or of going from working 9 to 5 every day to working 9:30 to 5 every day.</p> \n<p>But there was no overall collapse in employment. The total number of employed people grew by more than 50 percent during this period, keeping up with population growth. Wages rose steadily at a pace of about 2.23 percentage points faster than inflation in the average year.</p> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""3885750""><img src=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3885750/top_1percent_share_of_income.png""></div> \n<p>And the growth was widely shared. There were rich people and poor people, of course, but the share of overall national income accruing to the very wealthy was modest and generally falling. The fast pace of automation<em> </em>did<em> not </em>mean the only people who could get ahead were those clever enough to invent the new machines or lucky enough to earn them. Individual people lost out at particular moments in time, but on average, the tide rose rapidly and lifted the vast majority of the boats.</p> \n<h3>The big slowdown</h3> \n<p>Today it appears to most people that we are living in a period of immense technological change. A rather small device that I carry in my pocket replaces the telephone that used to sit in my bedroom, the Walkman in my pocket, the TI-85 calculator in my backpack, every single book I've ever owned, the Sega Genesis on the shelf, the alarm clock on my bedside table, and even, to some extent, my television. And yet it doesn't only replicate the functions of those devices. In most cases it far surpasses them.</p> \n<p>But despite the techno-hype and the national obsession with disruption, the pace of productivity growth has slowed down. The American economy has grown, but largely by adding workers rather than by workers equipping themselves with powerful new machines to multiply their capabilities. And the number of hours worked per worker has stayed relatively flat, even while other countries have continued to enhance their leisure.</p> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""3877928""><img src=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3877928/toil.png""></div> \n<p>If robots were taking our jobs, the productivity of the workers who still have jobs — the total amount of work that gets done divided by the total number of people who are employed — would be going up rapidly. But it's not. It <em>is </em>rising, but it's rising <em>slower</em> than it did in the past.</p> \n<p>And the slowing rate of productivity growth is an important source of the wage slowdown that people have been worrying about.</p> \n<p>The <a href=""https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/docs/cea_2015_erp.pdf"">2015 Economic Report of the President</a> calculated that if productivity growth had continued at its 1948–1973 pace for the past 40 years, the average household's income would be $30,000 higher today. By contrast, had inequality stayed at its 1973 level for the same period, Obama's Council of Economic Advisers calculates that the average household's income would be only $9,000 higher.</p> \n<p>The productivity issue is bigger than inequality, in other words. And yet it's much less discussed.</p> \n<p>In fact, it's almost anti-discussed due to the obsession in media and political circles with the alleged rise of the robots. We're so busy worrying about how to counteract an imaginary, robot-driven productivity surge that we're barely paying attention to the real story of the productivity slowdown.</p> \n<h3>The Solow Paradox</h3> \n<div class=""align-right""><img data-chorus-asset-id=""3906390"" alt=""starbucksrobot.0.gif"" src=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3906390/starbucksrobot.0.gif""></div> \n<p>But what about the bounty of digital technology that is in evidence all around us? Almost 30 years ago, the great economist Robert Solow quipped, ""You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.""</p> \n<p>An answer to the riddle might be that digital technology has transformed a handful of industries in the media/entertainment space that occupy a mindshare that's out of proportion to their overall economic importance. The robots aren't taking our jobs; they're taking our <em>leisure</em>.</p> \n<p>Data from the <a href=""http://www.bls.gov/tus/charts/sleep.htm"">American Time Use Survey</a>, for example, suggests that on average Americans spend about 23 percent of their waking hours watching television, reading, or gaming. With Netflix, HDTV, Kindles, iPads, and all the rest, these are certainly activities that look <em>drastically</em> different in 2015 than they did in 1995 and can easily create the impression that life has been revolutionized by digital technology.</p> \n<p>What's more, the media industry itself has been turned upside down by the internet and has spent the last decade telling anyone who will listen how complete and wrenching the transformation has been. That further amplifies a narrative about rapid change.</p> \n<p>But clearly the media and entertainment industries don't comprise anything close to 23 percent of the workforce or the total economic output of the United States. Most other job categories have been impacted by digital technology, but only in relatively superficial ways. Something like 9 percent of all private sector jobs are in the food service industry. These days people are perhaps more likely to book a reservation or order a takeout meal with an app rather than a phone call, but the core work of serving and preparing food has seen very little progress.</p> \n<p>At the higher end of the salary spectrum, we still don't have <a href=""http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2013/03/the-robot-will-see-you-now/309216/"">robot doctors</a> who can treat patients in lieu of costly and inconvenient human ones. Indeed, <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/5/7/8565057/medical-records-terrible"">we can't even get medical records digitized properly</a>.</p> \n<p>As it becomes clearer and clearer over time that smartphones and the internet simply aren't economic game changers on the same scale as air conditioning, jet planes, container ships, and televisions, it's become increasingly fashionable in Silicon Valley to simply retreat into denial.</p> \n<p>""There is a lack of appreciation for what’s happening in Silicon Valley,"" Google's chief economist, <a href=""http://www.wsj.com/articles/silicon-valley-doesnt-believe-u-s-productivity-is-down-1437100700"">Hal Varian, told the Wall Street Journal</a>, ""because we don’t have a good way to measure it.""</p> \n<p>The article states that Varian believes a ""problem with the government’s productivity measure"" is that ""it is based on gross domestic product, the tally of goods and services produced by the U.S. economy.""</p> \n<p>But this is not a measurement error. This is the <em>definition</em> of economic productivity. When people can create more goods and services for sale in the market economy, their productivity goes up. When they cannot, it does not. It is obviously true that there are things in life that matter that are not monetized in this way. I, personally, derive enormous pleasure from daily jokes on Twitter. That said, Silicon Valley hardly invented the idea that the best things in life are free. The joy that my infant son's smile brings to my face isn't in the GDP numbers either. Nor is the sadness I feel when reflecting on the fact that my late mother didn't live to meet him.</p> \n<p>But if you want to put a roof over your baby's head, to keep him in diapers and formula, and to buy some plane tickets so he can go with you to visit his grandparents, then you are going to need some <em>money</em>. And money derives from monetized economic activity.</p> \n<h3><strong>It's getting worse</strong></h3> \n<p>The productivity slowdown began decades ago and initially corresponded with bad news from abroad about oil prices. It persisted through a sharp recession that broke the back of inflation, and continued through the Reagan recovery. In the mid- to late 1990s things briefly turned around, and it momentarily looked like the Solow Paradox was gone. Walmart and other big-box stores learned to use computers to better control their inventories and greatly improved the productivity of the retail sector.</p> \n<p>As is typical with periods of rapid technological change, this led to some displacement and suffering and heartburn. But even though the late '90s were a terrible time to be the owner of a mom-and-pop hardware store, <em>on average</em> it was a period of low unemployment and rising wages.</p> \n<p>But as Paul Krugman has written, ""We did not, it turned out, get a sustained return to rapid economic progress. Instead, it was more of a one-time spurt, <a href=""http://www.bls.gov/lpc/prodybar.htm"">which sputtered out around a decade ago</a>.""</p> \n<p>In the most recent years, it's actually gotten worse than ever.</p> \n<p> </p> \n<div style=""text-align:center""> \n<blockquote class=""twitter-tweet""> \n<p dir=""ltr"" lang=""en"">From a Wells Fargo note: productivity is slumping in nearly every industry <a href=""http://t.co/QtlaNTQ8ix"">pic.twitter.com/QtlaNTQ8ix</a></p> \n— Josh Zumbrun (@JoshZumbrun) <a href=""https://twitter.com/JoshZumbrun/status/618166244391436288"">July 6, 2015</a>\n</blockquote> \n<p> </p> \n</div> \n<p> \n<script charset=""utf-8"" src=""//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js""></script> \n</p> \n<p>This extreme slowdown has coincided with a period of weak demand, high unemployment, and agonizingly slow wage growth. That all adds up to an environment in which managers have little budget to invest in new equipment due to weak sales, and little incentive to give raises due to poor worker bargaining power.</p> \n<p>Rather than hot business trends relating to new equipment that allows workers to deliver more value than ever before, one of the signal trends of our time has been a proliferation of online services that reduce the friction associated with having people get in their car and bring you things. Washio, for example, will send someone to my house to pick up my dry cleaning. Seamless will ping a restaurant and tell it to deliver takeout to my door. Postmates will send someone to get a takeout dinner from a restaurant that doesn't offer delivery. Homejoy will send someone to clean my house. These startups are okay business ideas, but they are not doing anything to advance the efficiency with which clothing is laundered, meals are cooked, or houses are cleaned.</p> \n<p>The main industry in which productivity is accelerating rapidly is the information technology industry itself. We are getting better and better at making smartphones, apps, cloud services, and all the rest. Those things just aren't driving change in the larger economy. Indeed, the way modern digital technology blurs the lines between entertainment devices and productivity devices in some ways works to <em>undermine</em> the productivity of the modern office worker. Email means you can stay in touch with remote colleagues, but it also means you can send a note to your dad during business hours. It's clear from the analytics at Vox.com and every other website that America's white-collar workforce is doing a lot of Facebook updates, tweeting, and casual web browsing during business hours. It's surely not a coincidence that 2015's hottest office productivity tool is a group chat service called Slack.</p> \n<p>This may make life more pleasant in some respects (and annoying in others, as family dinners are now interrupted by random work emails), but it adds up to a remarkably modest impact on the overall health of the economy.</p> \n<h3>The less-work future</h3> \n<p>Of course, all this <em>might</em> change. The power of Moore's Law — which states that the power of computer chips doubles roughly every two years — is such that the next five years' worth of digital progress will involve bigger leaps in raw processor power than the previous five years. It's at least <em>possible</em> that we really will have a massive leap forward in productivity someday soon that starts substantially reducing the amount of human labor needed to drive the economy forward.</p> \n<p>But robots are never going to take <em>all</em> the jobs.  The problem with trying to envision ""a world without work"" is that it asks us to envision an unrealistically large change.</p> \n<p>The more likely outcome is a world with <em>less</em> work. And that's a world we should welcome rather than fear. It's a world in which we can make some policy decisions we want to make, rather than decisions we really <em>don't</em> want to make.</p> \n<p>The ""normal"" Social Security retirement age in the United States used to be 65. Currently it is moving up to 67. Many prominent politicians, from Jeb Bush and Chris Christie to the bipartisan Simpson-Bowles commission on deficit reduction, say that to keep the system solvent we need to move it up even further, to 70. In a world of more productivity and less work, instead of doing that, we might move it back down to 65. Or maybe even cut it back to 62.</p> \n<p>Some more ideas:</p> \n<ul> \n<li>Right now the <a href=""http://www.cepr.net/documents/publications/no-vacation-update-2013-05.pdf"">average American gets 10 paid vacation days and six paid holidays</a>. We could emulate Germany, where 20 and 10 are the current minimum. Or go really nuts and copy Austria, where it's 22 and 13.</li> \n<li>We could reduce the high school and college dropout rates, and slightly increase the number of college graduates who go on to some form of graduate school.</li> \n<li>We could emulate Sweden's 480 days of <a href=""https://sweden.se/quickfact/parental-leave/"">paid leave for new parents</a>.</li> \n<li>We could give college students more generous grants so more of them could focus full-time on their studies rather than dual-tracking school with work. </li> \n<li>Right now, 44 percent of mothers with full-time jobs <a href=""http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2013/08/19/mothers-and-work-whats-ideal/"">say they would rather work part time</a>. We could make that happen. </li> \n</ul> \n<p>These are just illustrative ideas, of course, not a comprehensive program. But they go to show that given decent public policy, an automation-driven productivity surge is nothing to be afraid of. For any given item on that list, the natural objection will be that ""we can't afford it."" If productivity accelerated, we could easily afford it — and more — reducing the total amount of human toil while still maintaining the basic life-cycle concept of a career.</p> \n<h3>If the robots don't arrive</h3> \n<p>The real threat is precisely the opposite — that the per-hour productivity of the American worker <em>won't</em> increase at a more rapid rate.</p> \n<p>If you've ever heard a dreary lecture about the ""entitlement crisis,"" that is the world they are talking about. The American population is aging and is projected to continue aging. In other words, the ratio of working-age people to retired people is falling. That means that we will have to either reduce the living standards of the elderly by cutting their benefits, or reduce the living standards of the non-elderly by raising their taxes or cutting spending on programs they depend on.</p> \n<p>By the same token, the proposition that ""health-care costs"" will bury the country is essentially the proposition that technology <em>won't</em> dramatically increase the productivity of the health-care sector. That means, again, some combination of reduced benefits for the sick and higher premiums and taxes for the healthy.</p> \n<p>Most likely, we'll keep doing a little bit of both.</p> \n<p>Unless, that is, some robots come along to help us out.</p> \n</div> \n<p> \n<script type=""text/javascript""><!-- \nPLAYGIF_DISABLE_FLAG = true; \n// --></script> \n</p>",Business & Finance
"Why Google is renaming itself ""Alphabet""",http://www.vox.com/2015/8/10/9128375/why-google-is-renaming-itself-alphabet,Google is getting a new CEO and a massive reorganization.,"<p>Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin have never been known for thinking small.   The journalist Steve Levy <a href=""https://books.google.com/books?id=V1u1f8sv3k8C&amp;pg=PA271&amp;lpg=PA271&amp;dq=how+many+engineers+does+microsoft+have+million&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=BSpU6s9hkC&amp;sig=rhABRFuPpCUho_UPZfuvQwergns&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwA2oVChMI1eOUjrefxwIVCZseCh3F1g4O#v=onepage&amp;q=how%20many%20engineers%20does%20microsoft%20have%20million&amp;f=false"" target=""_blank"">writes about a 2004 conversation</a> between Google co-founder (and now CEO) Page and then-CEO Eric Schmidt. They were discussing international expansion, and Schmidt asked Page how big Google should get.</p> \n<p>""How many engineers does Microsoft have?"" Page asked. Page was told Microsoft had about 25,000 engineers. ""We should have a million,"" Page said.</p> \n<p>That kind of restless ambition was on display today as Page and co-founder Sergey Brin <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2015/08/google-alphabet.html"">announced a massive reorganization</a> of Google. When the process is complete, Google will become a subsidiary of a new company called Alphabet, which will be a holding company for a variety of ambitious ventures undertaken by Brin and Page. Larry Page is stepping down as CEO in favor of a relative unknown, Sundar Pichai.</p> \n<h3>Why are Google's founders creating a new company?</h3> \n<p>Google started as a company that built a search engine, but over time it's become a lot more than that. The Mountain View, California, company has created or acquired a number of other hugely popular internet products, including YouTube, Android, and Gmail. More recently, the company has begun pouring resources into projects like <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/12/23/7440899/google-self-driving-car-photo"">self-driving cars</a>, <a href=""http://www.calicolabs.com/"">anti-aging technology</a>, and <a href=""http://www.google.com/loon/"">balloon-powered internet access</a>.</p> \n<p>Page and Brin believe that these projects have become too diverse and sprawling for a single operating company to manage all of them effectively. Different projects require different types of leaders, different company cultures, and different types of resources. So they're creating Alphabet as a holding company that will oversee all of these different ventures while allowing each to have more independence.</p> \n<p>""We’ve long believed that over time companies tend to get comfortable doing the same thing, just making incremental changes,"" Page wrote in his <a href=""http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2015/08/google-alphabet.html"">blog post</a> announcing the change. ""But in the technology industry, where revolutionary ideas drive the next big growth areas, you need to be a bit uncomfortable to stay relevant.""</p> \n<p>Page hopes that giving the various parts of the Google empire more autonomy will make it easier for them to stay outside their comfort zones and push the technological envelope.</p> \n<h3>Who is Google's new CEO?</h3> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""3957724"" alt=""GettyImages-464948932.0.jpg"" src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3957724/GettyImages-464948932.0.jpg""></p> \n<p> </p> \n<p class=""caption"">Sundar Pichai (LLUIS GENE/AFP/Getty Images)</p> \n<p> </p> \n<p>Google's new CEO is Sundar Pichai, who has been at the company since 2004. Last year, a management shakeup made him Larry Page's top deputy. Fortune explained Pichai's rise through the ranks in a <a href=""http://fortune.com/2014/10/27/google-rise-of-sundar-pichai/"">2014 article</a>.</p> \n<p><!--  ########  BEGIN SNIPPET  ########  --></p> \n<div data-analytics-category=""article"" data-analytics-action=""link:related"" class=""chorus-snippet s-related"">\n<span class=""s-related__title"">Related</span> <!-- Add links here --> <a href=""http://www.theverge.com/a/sundars-google"">Sundar’s Google: What does the man who runs Google’s most important products want?</a> <!-- End links -->\n</div> \n<!--  ########  END SNIPPET  ########  --> \n<p><span>Pichai has managed a number of Google products over the past decade. He was an early leader of Google Chrome, which was launched in 2008 and has become the world's most popular web browser. As Fortune put it, Chrome's success ""became the engine that powered Pichai through one of the fastest corporate ascents in the technology industry.""</span></p> \n<p>Pichai was put in charge of Gmail and then Android, two other highly successful Google products. Last year he was put in charge of the majority of Google's products, including its search engine, a position that put him in line to succeed Page.</p> \n<p><a href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/heres-what-people-are-saying-about-sundar-pichais-promotion-2014-10"">Insiders say</a> that Pichai is almost universally liked within Google and has a knack for navigating Google's politics without ruffling too many feathers. He's adept at understanding Larry Page's vision and translating it into practical business decisions and getting different parts of Google's often fractious organization to work together.</p> \n<p>""Sundar has been saying the things I would have said (and sometimes better!) for quite some time now, and I’ve been tremendously enjoying our work together,"" Page wrote today. ""He has really stepped up since October of last year, when he took on product and engineering responsibility for our Internet businesses.""</p> \n<h3>What will Larry Page and Sergey Brin do now?</h3> \n<p>Page will be the CEO of Alphabet, and Brin will be its president. Page hopes the reorganization will allow him and Brin to focus on the big picture. But their announcement isn't very clear about what exactly that means.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""right""><span>Page and Brin are more excited about launching new ventures</span><span> </span><span>than they are about managing existing ones</span></q></p> \n<p>""Our model is to have a strong CEO who runs each business, with Sergey and me in service to them as needed,"" Page wrote. ""We will rigorously handle capital allocation and work to make sure each business is executing well.""</p> \n<p>A big part of the duo's new role will be to focus on ""starting new things."" Like many founders, Page and Brin are more excited about launching new ventures<strong> </strong>than they are about managing existing ones. The new structure will allow them to periodically create new projects<strong> </strong>and then hire others to handle day-to-day operations.</p> \n<p>""We are not intending for this to be a big consumer brand with related products,"" Brin says. ""The whole point is that Alphabet companies should have independence and develop their own brands.""</p> \n<h3>How will Alphabet be structured?</h3> \n<p>From a shareholder perspective, Alphabet is just the new name for the company that used to be called Google. Google shares will become Alphabet shares, and existing Google shareholders will continue to hold a stake in all of the Alphabet companies.</p> \n<p>Full details of Alphabet's structure haven't been released yet, but Page did mention several ventures that will be pulled out of Google and may become independent ventures under the Alphabet umbrella:</p> \n<ul> \n<li>Google's life sciences research into things like glucose-sensing contact lenses</li> \n<li>Calico, Google's human longevity project</li> \n<li>Google's X Lab, which Page says ""incubates new efforts like Wing, our drone delivery effort""</li> \n<li>Google's investment arms, Ventures and Capital</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>How will this affect me as a Google user?</h3> \n<p>In the short run, it won't affect you at all. Most of the popular Google products you probably use every day will stay under the Google umbrella and will continue to operate the way they always have.</p> \n<p>If the launch of Alphabet affects users, it will be because some of those more ambitious projects pay off. For example, the Calico project hopes to extend human lifespans — that's probably not going to happen in the next year or even the next decade. Indeed, as I think Page himself would acknowledge, most of Google's ambitious bets are unlikely to pay off at all. But if a few of them do work out, it could have huge benefits.</p> \n<p><b>Disclosure</b><b>:</b> My <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://twitter.com/startupandrew"">brother</a> is an <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.firebase.com/blog/2014-10-21-firebase-joins-google.html"">executive</a> at Google.</p> \n<hr> \n<!-- CHORUS_VIDEO_EMBED ChorusVideo:76246 -->",Business & Finance
Google is becoming Alphabet. Here's why that's a big deal.,http://www.vox.com/2015/8/11/9130055/google-alphabet-big-deal,CEO Larry Page is betting he can reinvest Google's billions of dollars in profit more effectively than the broader market can.,"<p>On Monday, Google CEO Larry Page announced a major reorganization: The search giant is getting a new parent company, called Alphabet. In addition to owning Google, Alphabet will own other business ventures launched by Page and Google co-founder Sergey Brin.</p> \n<p>It used to be more common for big companies to plow their profits into ambitious research and development projects. But in recent years, companies have been increasingly returning their profits to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks instead. Page is bucking that trend, betting that he and Brin can invest Google's vast profits more effectively than the broader market can.</p> \n<p>He could be right. Google is structured in a way that gives Page and Brin total control over Google, which means that the founders can make long-term bets that would be hard for most CEOs — who serve at the pleasure of their boards — to make.</p> \n<h3>The way we innovate has changed a lot since the mid-20th century</h3> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""3958434"" alt=""GettyImages-51239931.0.jpg"" src=""https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3958434/GettyImages-51239931.0.jpg""></p> \n<p> </p> \n<p class=""caption"">An office with IBM computing equipment in the 1950s. (<span>Getty Images)</span></p> \n<p> </p> \n<p>To see why Alphabet could be a big deal, it helps to look back to the mid-20th century. In many ways, this was a golden age for American innovation generally, and computer technology in particular. A lot of these innovations were driven by a handful of huge conglomerates. The transistor was invented by the national telephone monopoly, AT&amp;T. The early computer industry was dominated by an office equipment manufacturer, IBM. The graphical user interface was invented by a Xerox research lab.</p> \n<p>But in the 1970s, things began to shift. When we think of the major innovations of the past 40 years, we don't think of industrial giants like AT&amp;T or IBM. Rather we think about Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, and Mark Zuckerberg creating new companies and new product categories from scratch.</p> \n<p>In the modern invention story, big companies are less likely to be a source of inventions than an obstacle to progress — or simply irrelevant. One generation's disruptors become the next generation's disruptees.</p> \n<h3>Big companies face pressure to return cash to shareholders</h3> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3958440/GettyImages-480950086.0.jpg"" alt=""GettyImages-480950086.0.jpg"" data-chorus-asset-id=""3958440""></p> \n<p> </p> \n<p class=""caption"">Activist investors like Carl Icahn have been pressuring companies like Apple to <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.theverge.com/2013/10/24/5024016/investor-carl-icahn-pushes-apple-on-150-billion-buyback"">return their profits</a> to shareholders. (Adam Jeffery/CNBC/NBCU Photo Bank via Getty Images)</p> \n<p> </p> \n<p>Over the same period, we've seen a big shift in what CEOs do with their companies' profits. Instead of plowing their profits back into new investments, as they might have done a generation earlier, companies are increasingly <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/10/7/6921153/buybacks-dividends"">returning the profits to investors</a> through dividends and share buybacks.</p> \n<p>And that's not a coincidence. If you believe that innovation mostly comes from venture-backed startups that disrupt established companies, and that established companies mostly squander resources in a futile effort to ward off obsolescence, then this is precisely what you should want big companies to do.</p> \n<p>Also, capital markets are larger and more sophisticated than they were a few decades ago. In the early days of Silicon Valley, even the most promising startups struggled to find anyone willing to fund them, so working at a big company was often the only way to get the funding needed to get a cutting-edge idea off the ground.</p> \n<p>Now Silicon Valley is awash in capital. There are dozens of venture capital firms eager to fund every promising technology idea. So, the theory goes, technology visionaries no longer need the backing of big companies to fund their great idea.</p> \n<h3>Alphabet is uniquely positioned for long-term investments</h3> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3958452/GettyImages-152766137.0.jpg"" alt=""GettyImages-152766137.0.jpg"" data-chorus-asset-id=""3958452""></p> \n<p> </p> \n<p class=""caption"">As long as Page has the support of co-founder Sergey Brin, he can do what he wants with Google's billions. (Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)</p> \n<p> </p> \n<p>So most companies face pressure to stick to making products in their core area of competence — in this case, online services — and return extra profits to shareholders. But Page has no intention of doing that. Indeed, last year he <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/4/16/5621932/most-companies-have-to-worry-about-what-wall-street-thinks-heres-why"">reorganized Google</a> in a way that allows him and co-founder Sergey Brin to raise more capital without losing control of the company. Page thinks he and Brin will be able to put Google's profits to use more effectively than Google's shareholders could.</p> \n<p>There are obviously many examples of the conventional venture capital approach working well and producing major innovations. But there may be some innovations that a huge, well-funded organization like Alphabet might be better positioned to accomplish than a conventional venture-backed startup can. There are now a ton of venture capital firms looking to fund innovative startups. But there are very few technology companies that are controlled by their founders and have significant cash to invest. Google is one of them, which means it can do things few other companies can.</p> \n<p>A big disadvantage of the venture capital model is that startup founders have to choose between raising large sums of money and maintaining control of their companies. Some founders, such as Mark Zuckerberg and Page and Brin themselves, have managed to build huge companies while maintaining control. But that was only possible because they were able to get a product to market with a small initial investment. That meant that as Google and Facebook grew, its founders could run their companies in ways they thought made sense without worrying much about what investors wanted.</p> \n<p>But there are many types of innovation where this just isn't possible: It costs so much to get the company off the ground that founders wind up as minority shareholders in their own companies. And once founders lose control of their companies, they face more pressure to worry about short-term profitability. Venture capitalists are willing to lose money for several years in hopes of a significant payoff down the road, but they still want to have a clear plan to reach profitability. Hardly any are willing to invest in wide-ranging research for a decade or more in hopes that it will eventually produce a marketable product.</p> \n<p>And most Fortune 500 CEOs face a similar constraint. They might have plenty of cash, but they face pressure from Wall Street to deliver solid financial results on a quarterly basis. In practice, that creates pressures not that different from those exerted by venture capital firms: CEOs can invest, but only in projects that have the prospect to produce returns within a few years.</p> \n<p>But Google is structured in a way that guarantees Page and Brin will control the company as long as they're both alive and working for the company. They're relatively young men, and could easily run Google for another three or four decades. That allows them to make long-term bets in technologies — like self-driving cars or life-extension technology — that might not pay off for a decade or more. These are investments that few venture capital firms — or most large, established companies — would be willing to make.</p> \n<p>Obviously, it's impossible to predict how successful this strategy will be. Page and Brin might wind up wasting their shareholders' money on boondoggles that never produce significant benefits.</p> \n<p>But it's also possible they'll find big opportunities that investors with shorter time horizons have missed. Perhaps the pendulum has swung too far toward a world where companies are a little <em>too</em> accountable for delivering short-term financial results. Maybe the American economy needs some companies engaged in the kind of ambitious, long-term research that companies like AT&amp;T and Xerox engaged in a half-century ago.

Not satisfied with founding one of the world's biggest and most influential technology companies, he's now plotting to spend billions of dollars in Google profits on new ventures that are far removed from Google's original search business.</p> \n<p>To do that, Page and co-founder Sergey Brin are planning to give Google a new parent company called Alphabet. Alphabet will own Google plus a variety of other companies. These include technology businesses like Nest (which Google bought in 2014) and Google Fiber (which provides home internet access in certain cities). It will also include more radical efforts like <a href=""http://www.calicolabs.com/"">Calico</a>, a company that's trying to increase human lifespans. Each of these businesses will have its own CEO and business strategy. And Alphabet will include new ventures that Page and Brin conceive in the coming years.</p> \n<p>Clearly separating Google from other ventures could give the CEO of each company the ability to focus on their unique areas of expertise.</p> \n<p>Not much will change from the perspective of a Google user. Products will continue to use their existing brands — there won't be an Alphabet search engine or an Alphabet smartphone OS. Google will get a new CEO, Sundar Pichai, who has been at Google for a decade. He was promoted to be Page's top deputy last year, putting him in line to be CEO.</p> \n<p>Like many founders, Page and Brin are more excited about launching new ventures than they are about managing existing ones. The new structure will allow them to periodically create new projects and then hire others — such as Pichai and <a href=""http://www.calicolabs.com/arthur-levinson/"">Calico CEO Arthur Levinson</a> — to handle day-to-day operations of individual companies.</p> \n<p>Page and Brin's ambitious plans for Alphabet are made possible by Google's unusual corporate structure, which gives the co-founders a majority of the voting power. As a result, they have wide discretion to do as they please with Google, without worrying about what shareholders want.</p> \n<p>Profitable companies often face pressures to return cash to shareholders through dividends and buybacks, but Page is making clear he has no intention of doing that. Instead, he is creating Alphabet because he believes he can invest Google's billions of dollars in annual profits more effectively than Wall Street can.</p>",Business & Finance
Hillary Clinton thinks Wall Street is too focused on short-term profits. So does Google.,http://www.vox.com/2015/8/11/9133199/google-alphabet-hillary-clinton,Google CEO Larry Page is trying to solve a problem Clinton identified on the campaign trail.,"<p>Google CEO Larry Page <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/8/10/9128375/why-google-is-renaming-itself-alphabet"">announced on Monday</a> that he intends to create a new corporate parent, called Alphabet, which will own Google as well as a variety of other ventures.</p> \n<p>One way to understand the move is as a response to a problem that Hillary Clinton identified in a campaign speech last month: <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/7/24/9031597/hillary-clinton-quarterly-capitalism"">""quarterly capitalism.""</a></p> \n<p>Clinton argued that ""everything is focused on the next earnings report or the short-term share price, and the result is too little attention on the sources of long-term growth: research and development, physical capital, and talent.""</p> \n<p>In a sense, Page is trying to prove Clinton wrong, by building a company that's focused on ambitious long-term investments rather than quarterly financial results. But Page is also the exception that proves the rule: He and co-founder Sergey Brin have total control of Google, which isn't true of most other CEOs.</p> \n<h3>Clinton and Page both believe Wall Street is too focused on short-term results</h3> \n<p>The villain in Clinton's story is really Wall Street's focus on quarterly financial results. If a company reports several straight quarters of disappointing financial results, the CEO starts to worry about losing his job. So, the argument goes, she cuts back on long-term investments that could produce profits years in the future, in favor of incremental changes designed to juice profits in the next few months. In the long run, this means that companies produce fewer breakthrough innovations, and the economy as a whole grows more slowly.</p> \n<p>Clinton wants to tackle this problem with changes to public policy, including higher taxes on investors who hold stocks for fewer than six years and perhaps tweaks to corporate governance rules that give activists shareholders less influence over management. She hopes these changes will insulate CEOs from their shareholders, allowing them to focus more on the long term.</p> \n<p>Page is tackling the same problem from a very different angle: He wants to turn Google — now Alphabet — into a company dedicated to making big, risky, long-term investments. Google has long been a company with an interest in long-term investments — as evidenced by its ""moonshot"" investments in things like self-driving cars and <a href=""http://www.calicolabs.com/"">life-extension technology</a> — but the creation of Alphabet makes it official. Where Google was a search company with a side interest in moonshots, Alphabet aims to be a moonshot company whose most successful moonshot is Google itself.</p> \n<p>It might seem like Page's plan proves Clinton's thesis wrong, by demonstrating that companies are still able to make long-term bets. But it's important to recognize how unusual Page's position is. Through savvy negotiating in Google's early years, Page and co-founder Brin were able to maintain a majority of Google's voting rights. That means Page can't be fired by other Google shareholders, no matter how bad Google's quarterly results look or how much its share price drops.</p> \n<p>But the vast majority of public company CEOs don't enjoy this degree of autonomy. They serve at the pleasure of their shareholders, and are liable to lose their jobs if their share price falls too much. So most CEOs couldn't emulate Page if they wanted to; if they tried to turn their companies into moonshot factories, they'd face a revolt from their boards and likely lose their jobs. So it's worth thinking about whether there are ways to make it easier for other CEOs to behave more like Larry Page.</p>",Business & Finance
Google's plan with Alphabet: build the Bell Labs of the 21st century,http://www.vox.com/2015/8/12/9134005/google-bell-labs,Let's hope it works.,"<p>Larry Page and Sergey Brin have always seen Google's aim as more than mere profits. ""Google’s mission is to organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful,"" reads <a href=""http://www.google.com/about/company/"">the company website</a>. But even that's come to seem too small to its founders. In their 2004 IPO letter, they put it more broadly: ""We aspire to make Google an institution that makes the world a better place.""</p> \n<p>A more precise mission statement may be, simply, ""Google: better living through technology."" Page and Brin have become obsessed in recent years with what they see as a kind of market/cultural failure to pursue the big, expensive ideas that might truly change lives. In an interview with <a href=""http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/3173f19e-5fbc-11e4-8c27-00144feabdc0.html"" target=""_blank"">the Financial Times</a>, Page was unsparing:</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>Page estimates that only about 50 investors are chasing the real breakthrough technologies that have the potential to make a material difference to the lives of most people on earth. If there is something holding these big ideas back, it is not a shortage of money or even the barrier of insurmountable technical hurdles. When breakthroughs of the type he has in mind are pursued, it is ""not really being driven by any fundamental technical advance. It’s just being driven by people working on it and being ambitious,"" he says. Not enough institutions – particularly governments – are thinking expansively enough about these issues: ""We’re probably underinvested as a world in that.""</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>As Ben Thompson <a href=""https://stratechery.com/2015/do-you-trust-larry-page/"" target=""_blank"">writes</a>, Google's founders aren't business-and-strategy nerds, which is what continuing to run Google's search and advertising products would require. They are change-the-world nerds, and that's why they're reorganizing their company around breakthrough technologies.</p> \n<p>But in this, Google — excuse me, Alphabet — is walking well-trod territory. AT&amp;T took its monopoly profits and funded Bell Labs, which racked up Nobel Prizes, invented the transistor, and revolutionized our understanding of how the world began. Xerox took its profits and built PARC labs, which developed the graphical user interface that led to the Macintosh. And now Google wants to take the massive profits from its search-and-advertising business and fund its own factory dedicated to changing the world.</p> \n<p>Michael Hiltzik is the author of <i><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Dealers-Lightning-Xerox-PARC-Computer/dp/0887309895"" target=""_blank"">Dealers of Lightning: Xerox PARC and the Dawn of the Computer Age</a></i>, as well as the new book <i><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Big-Science-Lawrence-Invention-Military-Industrial/dp/1451675755/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1439332101&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=ernest+lawrence"" target=""_blank"">Big Science: Ernest Lawrence and the Invention That Launched the Military-Industrial Complex</a></i>. And so I asked him: Does Google have a chance at really making these moonshot technologies work? Or is this just founder ego run amok? A lightly edited transcript of our conversation follows.</p> \n<h3>Ezra Klein</h3> \n<p>Do you think the comparison of Google and Bell Labs or Xerox-PARC is valid?</p> \n<h3>Michael Hiltzik</h3> \n<p>There are a few things you need to do what Google seems to want to do. One is a huge flow of revenue. This is something AT&amp;T had when it was a monopoly provider of communication services and Xerox had when it was exploiting the revenue flow from what was then one of the most successful commercial products in history.</p> \n<p>The next thing was to create an atmosphere in the research arm that allowed serendipitous development. Most of what Bells Labs was trying to do was advance communications technology. But communication encompasses a lot of things. The transistor was the product of the idea that we should be more effective and efficient transmitters of voice information. They were looking for an alternative to vacuum tubes. When they discovered the background radiation of the Big Bang, they were ostensibly researching communications technology — they won a Nobel Prize, and that was okay.</p> \n<p>Xerox-PARC was the same way. The idea was to keep an eye on the digital future. Xerox deliberately established PARC on the other side of the country. They accepted it when the guy they put in charge of PARC said, Don’t expect anything you can commercialize in the next five years. So they ended up with the personal computer and the graphical user interface. No one could have foreseen that from the original charge.</p> \n<p>So when I look at Google’s R&amp;D, what interests me is they’re not only working on the self-driving car, which would be easy to commercialize, but life-extension technology, which is way out there. That reflects this culture where they want to nurture a spirit of inquiry.</p> \n<h3>Ezra Klein</h3> \n<p>From the corporate perspective, are Bell Labs and Xerox-PARC examples of success or failure? Bell Labs created the transistor, but it was Intel that commercialized it. Xerox-PARC created the graphical user interface, but it was Apple that commercialized it. There's huge social benefit in all this, but even if Google makes breakthroughs, is it likely to benefit from them?</p> \n<h3>Michael Hiltzik</h3> \n<p>It depends on the company. I’ve been talking about the culture of the research organization, but there’s also the question of the culture of the company and the reality of their business. AT&amp;T had a communications monopoly. So it could get into anything related to communications.</p> \n<p>Xerox was a prisoner of the success of the copier business — it had a whole sales and manufacturing structure devoted to this product. The way Xerox made its money wasn't even selling copiers, it was leasing them. You paid based on how many copies you made. So it was very hard for Xerox to get into anything that wasn’t really connected to the copier. They had 250,000 salesmen, and when they looked at the personal computer it wasn't even clear how they made their commission off of it.</p> \n<p>Google, almost from its inception, has had a much broader idea of what could be its business. Google engineers have always been given time to work on whatever they want. That tells you Google conceives of its business based on what it discovers. And that may mean the company is more able to absorb dramatically different technologies and discoveries.</p> \n<h3>Ezra Klein</h3> \n<p>But isn't the creation of Alphabet a signal that Page and Brin don't think that's true? It seems that implicit in this move is the idea that these other ideas and products are being somehow stanched by being inside Google, and they need to be spun out into separate entities if they're going to succeed.</p> \n<h3>Michael Hiltzik</h3> \n<p>That’s very possible. A company can also come to believe what it’s doing is costing it shares because Wall Street doesn’t understand how it all fits together. That's one reason you often see businesses spin out new product lines or break themselves into pieces.</p> \n<p>I was just looking at Google financials, and in 2014 they brought in $66 billion in revenue, brought in $10 billion profit, and they were holding over $60 billion in cash. Investors can’t say, Don’t use that money to look ahead. But things change over time. That’s why this is encouraging. They’re setting up a culture that looks ahead to innovations.</p> \n<h3>Ezra Klein</h3> \n<p>In his Financial Times interview, Page almost seems to be saying that there's a market failure around moonshot innovations — that for reasons both cultural and financial, there's too little investment in very big ideas, and so there's both good to be done there but also money to be made there. I guess another way of putting that is that Alphabet doesn't face competition for talent or big thinking right now from a Bell Labs or a Xerox-PARC. Do you think he's right?</p> \n<h3>Michael Hiltzik</h3> \n<p>I look at it in a broader sense. Traditionally — which is to say the last 50 to 75 years — the patron of basic research has been the government. The government doesn’t have these imperatives to think only about commercializable research. The internet was a government project. But what we’ve seen in recent decades is that government has started to withdraw from that role because it doesn’t want to spend that much and because the funding has become more politicized. Scientific research is easy to caricature and thus easy to cut. So basic scientific research has moved toward private industry, but they have these imperatives to foster the bottom line.</p> \n<p>Google is now the epitome of a company that has so much money coming in that they have the luxury of steering some of that money to worlds that no one knows exist yet.</p> \n",Business & Finance
Larry Page says he wants his fortune to go to Elon Musk.

Most wealthy individuals leave their money either to heirs or to a charitable foundation. But as Page later explained, he thought the Tesla Motors/SpaceX CEO could do more good with the money. In an <a href=""https://www.ted.com/talks/larry_page_where_s_google_going_next/transcript?language=en"">interview with Charlie Rose</a>, Page mentioned Musk's idea of ""backing up humanity"" by creating a parallel civilization on Mars as an example of an effective way to improve the world through business. ""That’s a company, and that’s philanthropical,"" he said.</p> \n<p>In retrospect, now that <a target=""new"" href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/8/10/9128375/why-google-is-renaming-itself-alphabet"">he's founding Alphabet</a> as a way to keep <a target=""new"" href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/8/11/9130055/google-alphabet-big-deal"">researching big moonshot ideas</a>, Page's comments seem less like idle musings and more like a coherent theory of how to best use his money to change the world: not by giving it away, but by investing it in projects he thinks could be truly revolutionary.</p> \n<h3>The paradox of philanthropy</h3> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""3962586"" alt=""Gapminder GDP per capita poverty chart"" src=""https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3962586/GDP-per-Capita-and-Share-of-People-Living-in-Absolute-Poverty-Gapminder-Graph0.0.png""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">As the above chart shows, the main factor in whether a country escapes extreme poverty is whether its economy grows.

Scientific research and technological innovation, however, are. The most important force in lifting people out of extreme poverty has, at least since the Industrial Revolution, been <a href=""http://ourworldindata.org/data/growth-and-distribution-of-prosperity/world-poverty/"">economic growth</a>, which is boosted by scientific discovery but not by charity. Improvements in life expectancy have been driven both by increased wealth and by medical advances, which are often funded and backed by pharmaceutical companies and other for-profit actors.</p> \n<p>Even major charitable success stories stand on the backs of technological and medical innovation. The eradication of smallpox was a major humanitarian undertaking, but one that required the invention of readily deployable vaccines. The Green Revolution — which dramatically increased crop yields in Mexico, India, and elsewhere — was sponsored by the Ford and Rockefeller Foundations, but worked by spreading existing technological improvements in farming to poor countries.</p> \n<h3>Doing good by dreaming big</h3> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""3962598"" alt=""dennis ritchie ken thompson"" src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3962598/kn3ztaadkrbexlzil0zp.0.jpg""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Ken Thompson (left) and Dennis Ritchie, who invented UNIX and C at Bell Labs.

What you are good at is making consumer products. It seems like if you want to do some good for the world, that's a useful skill set to draw upon. Things like Google Maps and Gmail and Hangouts and Android have already made life better for millions of people.

But then again, AT&amp;T didn't reap most of the benefits when its Bell Labs researchers invented the laser, or the transistor, or UNIX or the C programming language. Those advances trickled out and made the whole world better. Same goes for Xerox, whose Xerox PARC researchers invented the graphical user interface, which made widespread computer ownership and usage possible, and then saw companies like Apple and Microsoft profit from it while Xerox got little back.</p> \n<h3>Is Alphabet essentially a philanthropic endeavor?</h3> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""3436700"" alt=""v2.0.0.0.png"" src=""https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3436700/v2.0.0.0.png""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Google's self-driving car; if these go to market, they could save thousands of lives, help end congestion, and <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/5/28/5756736/the-case-for-self-driving-cars"" target=""new"">improve the world in countless other ways</a>. (Google)</p> \n<p>Alphabet gives Page the freedom to pursue those kinds of bigger projects. The reorganization's main purpose is to cleave the core functionality of Google — search, Maps, Docs, Gmail, YouTube, etc. — from the company's more far-out research projects: <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/6/1/8700459/google-self-driving-cars"">self-driving cars</a>, <a href=""http://www.google.com/makani/"">giant wind-energy-collecting kites</a>, attempts to <a href=""http://www.theverge.com/2014/9/3/6102377/google-calico-cure-death-1-5-billion-research-abbvie"">radically extend human lifespans</a>, <a href=""http://www.google.com/loon/"">balloon-based wifi provision</a>, etc. By placing those initiatives as subsidiaries of a company, just like Google, Page is signaling that he regards them as peers of similar importance, and suggesting that Alphabet's focus as a company will be just as much on exploring those kinds of moonshots as on improving Google's core business. The self-driving cars aren't a fun hobby supported by the search engine business, in other words. They're an equally crucial part of the business.</p> \n<p>Page also frees himself, and Sergey Brin, to focus on those projects rather than on Google qua Google. Page and Brin's time and attention are scarce and valuable resources at Alphabet, and by committing them to moonshots, Page improves their likelihood of success on the margin.</p> \n<p>He's also suggesting that he's going to use his own money to enforce a vision of Alphabet/Google as a company that invests in ambitious, crazy-seeming ideas. Page and Brin have purposefully structured Google such that not all shareholders have equal voting power — and so that the minority of shares (only about 14 percent) owned by <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/4/16/5621932/most-companies-have-to-worry-about-what-wall-street-thinks-heres-why"">Page and Brin wind up having a majority of votes</a>.

And Alphabet is set up to enable just that.</q></p> \n<p>This releases Page and Brin from any need to pursue share buybacks, pay out big dividends, or otherwise appease investors. Instead, profits can be plowed back into investments, including the long-shot projects Page is so passionate about. This only works, though, if he and Brin hold on to their stakes. If they were to sell them off and give the money to a foundation, they'd lose their ability to force Alphabet to invest in ambitious ideas. But by holding on to the roughly $30 billion apiece in Google stock they own, they can raise many more billions from investors to spend on self-driving cars, wind energy kites, and defeating death itself. They're leveraging their money to get even more money for the charitable cause Page thinks is most important: major, revolutionary innovation.</p> \n<p>Page said as much in his interview with Rose, arguing that using his money to influence and benefit his own company was the best method he had for doing good. ""You're working because you want to change the world. You want to make it better. <strong>Why isn't the company that you work for worthy not just of your time but your money as well?</strong>"" he asked (emphasis mine). ""I mean, but we don't have a concept of that. That's not how we think about companies, and I think it's sad, because companies are most of our effort. They're where most of people's time is, where a lot of the money is, and so I think I'd like for us to help out more than we are.""</p> \n<p>Page wants Google to be doing more to aggressively change the world.

New startup wants to sell your house for a third of what a traditional agent would charge,http://www.vox.com/2015/8/13/9148029/sqft-real-estate-cheaper,SQFT will help customers sell their home for 1 percent of the sales price â€” a third of what a conventional realtor charges.,"<p>On Monday I <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/8/10/9110233/redfin-glenn-kelman-profile"">profiled Redfin</a>, a technology company that set out to revolutionize the real estate industry but wound up adopting many of its practices instead. When I interviewed CEO Glenn Kelman for the story, I asked him if he saw any smaller, hungrier real estate startups following in Redfin's footsteps.</p> \n<p>""Not really, but I worry about it all the time,"" Kelman told me.</p> \n<p>After my story ran, I was contacted by a real estate startup that's doing just that. SQFT has created a mobile app and a set of real estate services that allow people to sell their homes for a third the cost of a traditional listing agent. I talked to the company's CEO, James Simpson, on Wednesday.</p> \n<p>Here's what distinguishes SQFT's business model from Redfin's — and what they still need to overcome to prove their approach is viable.</p> \n<h3>1) Redfin initially focused on buyers. SQFT is focusing on sellers.</h3> \n<p>From the outset, Redfin has offered services for both buyers and sellers, but because its original innovation was showing real estate listings on a map, most of its business came from buyers at first. One of the big hurdles Redfin faced was the fact that representing buyers is labor intensive.</p> \n<p>Buyers expect their agents to drive them around town touring houses, and a company can only offer that service if it has a significant staff on the ground in every city where it operates. That's why it has taken Redfin nine years and tens of millions of dollars to reach 36 states. It's not so labor-intensive to serve sellers, and SQFT hopes to get by with many fewer agents per city, allowing it to expand more quickly.</p> \n<p>This is significant because the sellers' side of the market has the most room for innovation. The seller is the one who sets the rules of any real estate transaction. So if a company wants to experiment with ways to make the real estate market more efficient, it needs to work with people who are selling homes, not just buying them.</p> \n<h3>2) SQFT relies on sellers to hold open houses</h3> \n<p>A traditional listing agent will run open houses for a property (Redfin does this too). That's a godsend for sellers who are nervous about interacting directly with buyers. But Simpson believes that some sellers will be willing to hold open houses themselves in exchange for thousands of dollars in savings — helping to keep SQFT's headcount down.</p> \n<h3>3) SQFT is still tiny</h3> \n<p>Simpson told me that his company has closed just 20 sales in the two months since it launched. Most of those sales occurred in Colorado, where the startup is based (it has ties to Boulder-based <a href=""http://www.techstars.com/"">Techstars</a>). It's raised $1.4 million in funding and has around a dozen people on staff.</p> \n<h3>4) SQFT charges a bit less than Redfin</h3> \n<p><strong></strong>Listing agents normally charge sellers 3 percent of a home's sales price — for example, $15,000 for a $500,000 house. SQFT charges just 1 percent — $5,000 for the same property. That compares favorably to Redfin's service for sellers, which charges 1.5 percent in most markets, though it has experimented with charging 1 percent in a few locations, including Washington, DC.</p> \n<h3>5) The big question is whether SQFT can get good prices for its customers</h3> \n<p>SQFT will save customers 2 percent of their home's value compared with a traditional listing service, but that's only a good deal if homes sold on SQFT can fetch prices as high as homes sold by more traditional realtors. Conventional realtors argue that their knowledge and experience — about advertising, staging furniture, timing, and other sales tactics — can fetch sellers a higher price than do-it-yourself sellers can earn. Unsurprisingly, Simpson disagrees — he thinks that with some advice from an SQFT agent, sellers willing to put in the necessary effort can sell a home as effectively as a professional.</p> \n<p>Still, ""we may not appeal to a first-time home seller who has never sold a house before,"" Simpson concedes. ""They might be a little bit anxious about using a service like ours. We're not going to appeal to everyone, but I think those that have been through a couple of transactions are going to be very comfortable using us.""</p> \n<h3>6) SQFT is an incremental advance over Redfin's business model</h3> \n<p><strong></strong>Real estate startups like SQFT have to deal with the traditional real estate agents who still dominate the market, and who do things much as they did a couple of decades ago, so there's not a ton of room to change how real estate is sold, at least in the short run. That's probably why SQFT isn't dramatically different from Redfin's service for sellers. SQFT offers a bit less service — no agent-run open houses — and charges a modestly lower price — 1 percent compared with 1.5 percent.</p> \n<p>Yet that doesn't necessarily mean SQFT's launch is insignificant. For the past few years, Redfin has benefited from being essentially the only technology company that also operated as a real estate brokerage. That might have been because Redfin itself seemed to be struggling to make its business model work. But now that Redfin has clearly found its footing, it's starting to attract imitators. That will force Redfin to keep innovating while keeping costs down, to the benefit of customers.</p>",Business & Finance
The Gap is ending on-call schedules. Here's why the practice was making workers miserable.,http://www.vox.com/2015/8/17/9151163/on-call-schedule-miserable,The Gap says it will no longer ask workers to call in an hour or two before a shift to find out if they are working.,"<p><span>In recent years, labor rights groups have campaigned against a common management tactic called on-call scheduling. </span><span>In an effort to save costs, many retailers require workers to call in just an hour or two before a shift starts to find out if they'll be able to work.

Often, she'd make herself available for a day's work, then be told not to come in.</span></p> \n<p>A new generation of software gives employers the ability to manage their labor costs more precisely than ever before, and this often leads to unpredictable and volatile work schedules.</p> \n<p>But the fact that employers can use these techniques doesn't necessarily mean they should. They can save employers money, but they often make lives miserable for low-income workers. And in the long run, treating workers poorly isn't necessarily a good business strategy. Companies such as Costco have figured out how to run a profitable retailer while offering workers stable and predictable schedules.</p> \n<h3>Managers are under pressure to cut costs</h3> \n<p><span>I asked Anna Haley-Lock, a professor at the school of social work at the University of Wisconsin, how employers set their employees' schedules. She told me that many companies have sophisticated programs that track employee hours in 15-minute increments and help managers make scheduling decisions.</span></p> \n<p>These programs are ""value-neutral,"" meaning they can be used to give workers predictable schedules or erratic ones. But they give managers the ability to manage labor costs in a fine-grained way that might have been challenging in the pre-digital world.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""right""><span>Many companies have sophisticated programs that track employee hours in 15-minute increments</span></q></p> \n<p>Employers using scheduling software, Haley-Lock says, can ""track sales and labor expenditures. If that ratio begins to look labor-heavy, they are eager to reduce the amount of labor expended. They will send people home early and they'll call folks off of shifts.""</p> \n<p>In larger organizations, managers often feel pressure to do this because they are given strict targets for labor costs. If sales fall short on a particular day, managers have to cut worker hours to hit their targets.</p> \n<p>But Haley-Lock says it's not only large companies that have adopted software-based just-in-time scheduling techniques. Small businesses do it too.</p> \n<p>For example, Haley-Lock visited a ""little private ma-and-pa restaurant in a rural area of Washington state. The owner walked me through with great enthusiasm the Excel spreadsheet he used to track his labor-to-sales ratio. He'd track it on an hourly basis and would use it to send workers home.""</p> \n<h3>Just-in-time scheduling isn't great for workers</h3> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""3969002"" alt=""Miami Valley Centre Mall"" src=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3969002/15067514625_60bb988cb4_k.0.jpg""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">(<a href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/fanofretail/15067514625/in/photolist-oXsX9V-nxLV9X-nxLXjP-pmvphR-9bbHtb-96huR-esUfiL-hNPBxS-3be9pt-itt1E-jYNvzx-b6NG7g-56ZF2A-8Vmh3M-eRopQ-nEWAf2-p9p71K-bx3hGz-sqgPFL-9qussh-hnhSRM-ngnEz9-wVd2Ru-iYcWYs-6XHoGh-rxRaws-nMUaUx-4N1nRH-jgrvrz-biwmxR-9Tgaus-53SfYh-jGhfhf-ruY9ba-noZMnu-pEf78J-iswusV-6J9acT-72S5rQ-6tEMeG-7ZyUD-7TTZVq-8ZvcBm-a5jvac-65Ggv3-ajymY4-bzgrEz-3JG54J-fAg6f2-893g7"">Nicholas Eckhart</a>)</p> \n<p>The trend toward using computers to more tightly manage workers' schedules parallels the trend of just-in-time manufacturing. In the past couple of decades, manufacturers have used sophisticated software to slash inventories and order new parts at the last minute. This not only cuts down on warehousing costs, it also makes the whole production process more nimble, because manufacturers can switch to new and improved components as soon as they're available.</p> \n<p>Many employers have tried to apply this nimble, waste-conscious attitude toward their workforces. But there's an important difference: Parts in a warehouse don't have personal lives. Workers do. When a company takes principles developed for supply chains and applies them to its labor force, the result can be chaos for workers.</p> \n<p>""You’re waiting on your job to control your life,"" Jannette Navarro, a Starbucks employee in San Diego, <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/08/13/us/starbucks-workers-scheduling-hours.html"">told the New York Times</a> last year. She found out each week's schedule just three days ahead of time, and she said that Starbucks software often determined everything from how much sleep her son would get to ""what groceries I’ll be able to buy this month."" (Starbucks <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.nytimes.com/times-insider/2014/08/22/times-article-changes-a-policy-fast/?_r=0"">changed its scheduling policies</a> after the Times article was published.)</p> \n<p>Erratic shifts that vary from week to week make workers' schedules challenging enough. On-call shifts make things even worse. If the employer cancels a shift, the worker generally gets no pay — and might still be on the hook for child care expenses.</p> \n<p>The use of on-call shifts, and variable schedules more generally, also creates a lot of uncertainty about workers' incomes from week to week. If business is slow for several weeks in a row, workers can wind up not making enough money to pay the rent. Espinal, the New York retail worker, says there were some parts of the year, such as after the holidays, when she could go days without getting a single shift.</p> \n<p>In a closely related practice, some employers will respond to unexpected demand by calling workers at the last minute and asking them to work unscheduled shifts. Espinal said that during the holidays she would be asked to stay on for extra hours at the end of her shift. That made it hard to have a social life, because she couldn't make plans with friends after work. ""You can't really plan ahead or map out your day or week,"" she says.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""right""><span>If the employer cancels a shift, the worker generally gets no pay</span></q></p> \n<p>The prevalence of on-call shifts and last-minute call-ins make it hard for workers to earn extra income by taking two jobs. It's becoming common for retail stores and restaurants to build large rosters of employees, giving many employees less than 30 hours of work per week. That wouldn't be so bad if employees had predictable schedules and could supplement their earnings with a second part-time job. But if workers don't have control over the schedules — and don't know if they'll be working until just hours ahead of time — it can be hard to find time for the second job, to say nothing of personal responsibilities.</p> \n<p>In this respect, a restaurant or retail establishment with ""flexible"" hours is the opposite of ride-hailing services like Uber and Lyft. Both types of employment involve irregular hours, but with Uber and Lyft, the drivers decide when and how long to work. They never have to worry about being unable to get the hours they want.</p> \n<h3>Labor law provides little protection against erratic schedules</h3> \n<p>You might think labor law would provide workers with some protections against erratic schedules, but that's generally not the case.</p> \n<p>""From an employment law perspective, scheduling is pretty much unregulated,"" says <a href=""http://law.gsu.edu/profile/charlotte-alexander/"">Charlotte Alexander</a>, a legal scholar at Georgia State University. Indeed, most worker protections related to scheduling take the existence of a schedule for granted.</p> \n<p>For example, if a worker reports for his scheduled shift and then is sent home without pay, some states require the worker to be paid a minimum amount — usually between two and four hours of work. But if an employer simply refuses to make a schedule until shortly before a shift starts, these laws don't apply.</p> \n<p>Indeed, Alexander worries that beefing up some of the existing worker protections, which take schedules as a given, will push employers toward abandoning schedules altogether, relying instead on a fully on-demand model in which workers don't learn if they have work until the last minute. ""I would be afraid about nudging employers any closer to an all-contractor, all-temp world than they're already going,"" she says.</p> \n<p>Instead, Alexander argues, the law should directly regulate scheduling. For example, the law might require employers to provide employees with their schedules a minimum number of days ahead of time. Employers that failed to provide sufficient notice — or who canceled shifts at the last moment — would be required to pay workers extra to compensate them for the inconvenience.</p> \n<h3>Costco provides a better model</h3> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""3969006"" alt=""Costco"" src=""https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3969006/15433538162_615bbff320_k.0.jpg""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">(<a href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/jeepersmedia/15433538162/in/photolist-pvNVcy-5kSj91-7pAaQ9-pekv1p-pdpAwy-dWyCL1-dWyCHG-dWsZER-883X82-pdpAR1-4fmB8N-puUnLV-eetaRg-nu1BCq-7SKBhK-6EFoqp-h1uhc-7UyYPA-aeGYtx-puUnaV-5prNj5-pvQHJ2-pvNURU-ptNtTU-ptNvvG-pemzw4-ptNvoY-pemkqj-6QCRuZ-pemkiA-pemzek-ptNv7f-pemyXt-pemySZ-pemyJn-pemyE4-pemyqX-pemkof-pvykpa-pekLT7-pekukr-pemz3P-pvyjYR-pvNUNh-pvyjG8-pekLcC-pvNUAU-pvyj7a-pekt1x-pekKEW"">Mike Mozart</a>)</p> \n<p>While just-in-time scheduling techniques have become increasingly common, Haley-Lock stresses that they're not universal. And she argues that companies can turn a profit while providing their employees with predictable schedules and adequate notice of their work hours.</p> \n<p>A good example is Costco, a discount retailer that puts a premium on treating its employees well. Haley-Lock and University of Chicago scholar Susan Lambert recently did an in-depth study of Costco's labor practices. With Costco's cooperation, they interviewed managers at a number of Costco locations in Illinois and Washington State. And they found that Costco workers do not suffer from the kind of scheduling instability many other retail workers do.</p> \n<p>""Costco is as concerned about profit as the next competitor,"" Haley-Lock says. ""But they think about work hours differently and how they handle and allocate work hours very differently.""</p> \n<p>She says that Costco ""ties their own hands"" by guaranteeing full-time workers 38 hours per week and part-time workers 24 hours. Rather than forcing workers to leave early, the company will ask for volunteers — and if no one volunteers, no one will get sent home.</p> \n<p>Having a company-wide policy in place protecting workers against unstable work hours changes managers' incentives. Rather than sending workers home at the first sign that business is slow, managers have to look for ways to keep workers busy through the end of their shifts.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""center""><span>In a market as competitive as the restaurant and retail industries, employers can benefit from treating their workers better</span></q></p> \n<p>One way they do this is by training workers to be proficient in multiple parts of the store, Haley-Lock says. That's valuable on days when demand is high in one part of the store and low in another. Rather than sending someone home in one department and calling in a different person in another — as other retailers might — Costco will transfer a suitably trained worker to the understaffed section of the store.</p> \n<p>And, of course, treating employees well makes them less likely to quit, which can reduce recruitment and training costs.</p> \n<h3>Treating employees well can be good business</h3> \n<p>Other employers have had similar experiences. Haley-Lock tells the story of two restaurants — one an upscale ""fast casual"" restaurant, the other a ""cheap family dining"" restaurant. The manager of the family dining restaurant told her, ""I often lose people who go across the street to the place that pays a little more an hour."" However, he said, ""then I get them back because they don't get the hours"" at the higher-paying restaurant.</p> \n<p>Workers don't have much bargaining power individually, but in a market as competitive as the restaurant and retail industries, employers can still benefit from treating their workers better. Employee turnover is a major cost for low-wage employers, and overly aggressive use of just-in-time scheduling techniques might wind up costing more than it saves once recruitment and training costs are taken into account. Restaurants and stores that offer their employees predictable shifts may be able to pay a bit less, and they're likely to hold on to each employee for longer.</p> \n<p>Scheduling software can obscure this reality. It can provide short-term ""savings"" that don't actually save much money because they increase employee dissatisfaction in the long run. Over time, employers may learn to use scheduling software to more precisely manage demand, while avoiding the excesses that make employees miserable.</p> \n<hr> \n<p><b>Correction: </b>An early version of this article suggested that work hour instability was increasing.

The labor market is tightening.

For example, some trucking companies that traditionally demanded at least two years of experience behind the wheel have begun paying for new employees to go to trucking school. In education, as another example, some schools are seeking permission to have teachers teach subjects outside their certified area of expertise.</p> \n<p>But in the long run, the best solution to a worker shortage is simple: Pay more. Any one employer can almost always get more workers if it pays enough, and if wages rise in an industry as a whole, that will attract more entry-level workers and career switchers.</p> \n<h3>Many workers haven't seen serious wage increases for years</h3> \n<p>One sign that worker shortages haven't gotten too serious yet is that wages are still rising more slowly than in previous economic recoveries:</p> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""3970464""><img src=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3970464/fredgraph.png""></div> \n<p>This chart, which shows the rate at which average wages have been rising over the past 25 years, is not adjusted for inflation. In inflation-adjusted terms, American workers' wages have been flat since the start of the Great Recession.</p> \n<p>That's a difference between the current economic boom and previous ones. During the boom periods of the late 1990s and mid-2000s, workers saw their wages rise by an average of about 4 percent per year. So far that hasn't really happened during the current economic recovery.</p> \n<p>So while labor markets have obviously tightened a lot since the depths of the Great Recession, there's little sign that the economy is overheating. If the Federal Reserve maintains its current low interest rate policies, the economic environment could continue improving for workers for several more years without producing much inflation.</p> \n<h3>American businesses can afford to give raises</h3> \n<p>Of course, many business owners say they can't afford to give raises. For example, a lot of restaurant owners say they just don't have the money to pay their chefs more without raising prices. And in a competitive restaurant industry, that might not be an option.</p> \n<p>That might be true in the restaurant industry, but it's not true across the economy:</p> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""3970352""><img src=""https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3970352/fredgraph-2.0.png""></div> \n<p>For the past few years, corporate profits have been at record highs. Businesses could be using those profits to boost worker pay. And if labor markets continue to tighten, they might be forced to do so.</p> \n<h3>A tight labor market could heal a lot of damage from the Great Recession</h3> \n<p>The Great Recession, like all recessions, hurt a lot of American workers. The worst hit were people who were laid off and never found another job.</p> \n<p>There were also workers who wound up stuck in jobs and careers they didn't like. During a recession, people have few job options and may be worried about investing in training if they're not sure it will lead to a better job afterward.</p> \n<p>A tight labor market is a boon both for long-term unemployed people and for people looking to change careers. Employers often pass over job applicants with long periods of unemployment on their resumes, but a worker shortage forces them to give some of these workers a second look.</p> \n<p>And it's a lot easier to switch careers in an environment where employers are hiring every qualified applicant they can find. Some employers will be willing to hire inexperienced career switchers for entry-level positions and train them on the job. And employees will feel more confident going back to school to train for a new career when demand for workers is high.</p>",Business & Finance
Amazon's relentless work culture is because it's the startup that never grew up,http://www.vox.com/2015/8/17/9164339/amazons-work-culture,"To maintain Wall Street's confidence in its zero-profit vision, the company can't show any sign of soft-heartedness.","<p>I once had the opportunity to ask a former very high-level executive with Amazon what it had been like to work with Jeff Bezos. ""I did the best work of my life,"" he told me, ""far better than I ever felt possible, and I don't regret leaving at all.""</p> \n<p>That's what I thought of when I read Sunday's lengthy New York Times article on <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/16/technology/inside-amazon-wrestling-big-ideas-in-a-bruising-workplace.html?_r=0"">""Amazon's Bruising, Thrilling Workplace.""</a> The Times highlights a few instances of clearly abusive behavior that go beyond what any sane company would want to see. A woman suffering from breast cancer was apparently told that ""difficulties"" in her ""personal life"" were impairing her job performance in a way that put her at risk of being fired. Another story tells of a person returning from treatment for thyroid cancer to a negative performance review.</p> \n<p>But Amazon is a large organization, and some edge cases of impropriety and misconduct are going to happen anywhere. <a href=""http://www.geekwire.com/2015/full-memo-jeff-bezos-responds-to-cutting-nyt-expose-says-tolerance-for-lack-of-empathy-needs-to-be-zero/"">I</a><a href=""http://www.geekwire.com/2015/full-memo-jeff-bezos-responds-to-cutting-nyt-expose-says-tolerance-for-lack-of-empathy-needs-to-be-zero/"">n an email to employees</a> in the wake of the article, Jeff Bezos clarified that if people see instances of employees ""being treated without empathy while enduring family tragedies and serious health problems,"" they should report them to HR.</p> \n<p>But the core thrust of the article isn't about the most egregious cases. It's about the culture that former executive described, except with a relentless focus on the ""I don't regret leaving at all"" side of the equation. It also doesn't get at what I think is a core reason that Amazon's culture of relentlessness is so important to the company: It's not profitable.</p> \n<h3>The startup that never grew up</h3> \n<p>Amazon's <a href=""http://www.slate.com/articles/business/moneybox/2014/01/amazon_earnings_how_jeff_bezos_gets_investors_to_believe_in_him.html"">modest to nonexistent profitability</a> makes the company very different, both culturally and operationally, from other big, mature tech companies like Apple, Microsoft, Google, or even the relatively new Facebook. Those are all companies who've found their way to core operations that are extremely high-margin and throw off tons of cash.</p> \n<p>Amazon looks much more like a relatively early-stage startup. Its relentless focus on low prices in pursuit of growth leaves it with very low margins. And whatever revenue it does scare up is invested in the further pursuit of growth. The mission is to get as big as possible, as fast as possible. The company squeezes costs remorselessly, but passes all that forward to customers in pursuit of even faster growth.</p> \n<p>There's a lot to like about this business strategy.</p> \n<p>But for a publicly traded company to <em>deliberately</em> eschew profitability over such a long span of time is asking Wall Street to have a lot of faith. Bezos has done remarkable things across a number of dimensions, but one of his most underrated skills as a CEO is simply his ability to sell investors on this strategy. There is no <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/7/24/9031597/hillary-clinton-quarterly-capitalism"">""quarterly capitalism""</a> at Amazon, and in fact the time horizon on the plan for world domination is <em>so</em> long that one can question whether there's any capitalism at all.</p> \n<h3>A featherbedding-free zone</h3> \n<p>That, I think, is the context in which you have to understand Amazon's corporate culture. For a company with Amazon's quarterly earnings reports to develop a reputation as a really sweet, caring workplace full of tons of supportive people who recognize the importance of living a full, rich, and balanced life could be absolutely deadly to Bezos's sales pitch to investors.</p> \n<p>Wall Street will tolerate ""less profit now in pursuit of more profit later."" Wall Street will absolutely not tolerate ""less profit now in pursuit of being a nice boss.""</p> \n<p>Fat profits will, by contrast, earn you the right to do pretty much whatever you want with your company. Tim Cook can angrily dismiss questions about Apple's environmental and accessibility initiatives by saying he <a href=""http://www.theverge.com/2014/3/1/5460482/tim-cook-fights-back-against-shareholders"">doesn't care about return on investment</a> because he's earning hundreds of dollars in profit off every iPhone he sells. Because Apple is relentlessly profit-focused, it would like to highlight its charitably minded activities.</p> \n<p>By contrast, when I wrote that Amazon was like a charity, <a href=""http://www.theverge.com/2013/4/12/4217794/jeff-bezos-letter-amazon-investors-2012"">Bezos denounced me in a letter to shareholders</a>. He doesn't like bad publicity, but what he <em>really </em>fears is that Wall Street will worry he's gone soft.</p> \n<h3>Save your tears for Amazon's blue-collar workers</h3> \n<p>The good news for white-collar workers put off by Amazon's corporate culture is that there's always the option of leaving. Precisely because Amazon has a reputation as such a hothouse place to work, nobody will look at you crosswise if you say you want to leave. And a stint at Amazon on your résumé looks great. The actual victims in this whole system are the blue-collar workers at Amazon's fulfillment centers.</p> \n<p>As you can read <a href=""http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/02/mac-mcclelland-free-online-shipping-warehouses-labor"">here</a> or <a href=""http://recode.net/2014/06/30/amazon-was-a-prison-says-former-worker/"">here</a> or <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/dec/01/week-amazon-insider-feature-treatment-employees-work"">here</a>, these are not good jobs. The working conditions are bad. The pay is bad. The prestige is low. Nobody walks away feeling pride in having done the best work of their lives. And working at a warehouse does not look particularly great on your <span>résumé</span>.</p> \n<p>The upshot of those brutal warehouse conditions is cheaper stuff and faster delivery for millions of middle-class customers. If the warehouses paid better, we would have to pay more for stuff. If you want to feel bad — or morally conflicted, or self-righteous — then I would focus on that.</p>",Business & Finance
The most neglected fact in immigration economics,http://www.vox.com/2015/8/17/9164725/immigration-and-wages-impact,Even the most skeptical economists admit that immigrants raise Americans' wages.,"<p>Donald Trump not only wants to build a wall across the US-Mexico border, he wants to find a way to make Mexico pay for the construction of the wall. It's part and parcel of Trump's bombastic nationalism shtick. But it raises an obvious question: If stopping people from moving here is so important, why quibble about the money? And that, in turn, raises the single most neglected point about the economics of immigration: Even the studies by the most immigration-skeptical economists show that immigration <em>raises</em> the incomes of native-born Americans on average.</p> \n<p>Don't take my word for it. <a href=""http://www.hks.harvard.edu/fs/gborjas/publications/popular/CIS2013.pdf"">Ask George Borjas</a>, who tends to be far and away the leading economist in the immigration-skeptical camp. He says the current level of immigrant workers in the United States raises US GDP by about $1.6 trillion relative to where it would be in a zero-immigration universe.</p> \n<p>But he cautions (emphasis added):</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>Of the $1.6 trillion increase in GDP, <strong>97.8 percent goes to the immigrants themselves</strong> in the form of wages and benefits; the remainder constitutes the ""immigration surplus"" — the benefit accruing to the native-born population, including both workers, owners of firms, and other users of the services provided by immigrants.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Wow — 97.8 percent! That sure sounds like a high number.</p> \n<p>But the key thing about it is that 97.8 percent is less than 100 percent. Which is to say that immigrants — unlike, say, thieves — are not imposing any net costs on the native-born. In fact, while drastically raising their own income they are slightly raising everyone else's income. And that's according to an economist who thinks high levels of immigration are <em>bad</em> public policy. Other studies by more immigration-friendly economists see considerably larger gains to the native-born. But the whole argument is about <em>how big</em> the net economic benefits to the native-born are, not whether they exist.</p> \n<p>Under the circumstances, Trump is correct. In strictly economic terms it doesn't make sense to be expending resources on trying to keep Latin Americans from moving to the United States. Immigration isn't costly, it's beneficial.</p> \n<p>Of course, this makes the rest of his <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/8/16/9162905/trump-immigration"">punitive anti-immigrant plan</a> seem very costly in economic terms.

After a federal investigation into conditions, the company started keeping an emergency vehicle with paramedics outside the warehouse to handle cases of heatstroke. An emergency room doctor who treated some of the warehouse's workers reported Amazon for unsafe work conditions.</p> \n<p>Apart from the heat, the warehouses paid little ($11 to $12 an hour) and imposed extremely strict discipline on employees. They used a point-based system wherein missed work, not working fast enough, or breaking safety rules earned a worker points, and employees with too many points were fired. Sick employees had to bring in doctor's notes and request medical waivers if they didn't want to get points. ""When the heat index exceeded 110, they'd give you voluntary time off,"" former worker Robert Rivas told Soper. ""If you wanted to go home, they'd send you home. But if you didn't have a doctor's note saying you couldn't work in the heat, you'd get points.""</p> \n<p>In 2012, after Soper's exposé, Amazon installed <a href=""http://articles.mcall.com/2012-06-03/business/mc-amazon-warehouse-air-conditioning-20120602_1_warehouse-workers-air-conditioning-breinigsville-warehouse"">additional air conditioning units</a> at its warehouses at a cost of $52 million — not insignificant a firm with <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/8/17/9164339/amazons-work-culture"">profit margins as razor-thin as Amazon's</a>. But conditions still aren't <em>good</em>.

Warehouse workers still have to endure long security screenings when leaving the facilities, time for which they are not compensated (<a href=""http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2014/12/09/supreme_court_rules_against_paying_workers_for_security_screenings_amazon.html"">Amazon went all the way to the Supreme Court</a> to avoid paying for time spent in security lines); the screenings restrict lunch breaks so much that a group of employees has <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/05/07/amazon-warehouse-workers-lunch-breaks_n_5283329.html"">filed a lawsuit</a> alleging the practice breaks federal wage and hour laws.

Disciplining workers for getting cancer is horrible.</p> \n<p>But white-collar Amazon workers are also typically paid high wages, due to Amazon's need to compete with other firms offering lucrative compensation for talented programmers. If they don't like Amazon's work culture, it's very likely there's another firm that will hire them that offers a more relaxed environment. The tech job market is very tight, and while Amazon's coders shouldn't <em>have</em> to leave to enjoy work-life balance, exit is still a viable option.</p> \n<p>Exit is not, generally, a viable option for warehouse employees: $11 an hour is not a competitive wage; generally the only people taking these jobs lack the credentials or skills necessary for more lucrative jobs and are taking positions at Amazon because it's the only work they can get. The alternative to working in a warehouse is, quite possibly, unemployment.</p> \n<p>So it's a little rich to see people like best-selling author John Green canceling their Amazon Prime subscriptions due to the company's treatment of its <em>well-paid</em> workers:</p> \n<p> </p> \n<blockquote lang=""en"" class=""twitter-tweet""> \n<p dir=""ltr"" lang=""en"">This NYT story by <a href=""https://twitter.com/jodikantor"">@jodikantor</a> made me cancel my Amazon Prime subscription.

In defense of Amazon's long hours,http://www.vox.com/2015/8/17/9166249/new-york-times-amazon,"Amazon, Apple, and other technology giants demand a lot of their employees. The rest of us benefit from the resulting innovations.","<p>The New York Times has gotten a lot of attention for its <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/16/technology/inside-amazon-wrestling-big-ideas-in-a-bruising-workplace.html?_r=0"">feature</a> on Amazon's work culture.

Google and Facebook are known for emphasizing work-life balance. Yet these companies' work cultures are ""balanced"" only compared with the insane expectations set by some of their competitors. When I worked as an intern at Google in the summer of 2010, many employees would get free dinner at the company cafeteria and then go back to their desks for a couple more hours of work.</span></p> \n<p>There's a good reason so many technology companies have intense, demanding workplace cultures. Especially in the software industry, employees who work longer hours get more work done. And we all benefit from the resulting innovations.</p> \n<h3>Working long hours helps people keep up in a fast-changing industry</h3> \n<p>There's a saying in the technology world that the best programmers are about <a href=""http://www.quora.com/Why-are-the-best-programmers-10x-more-productive-than-mediocre-programmers-but-paid-only-3x-as-much-Why-aren-t-they-paid-10x-as-much"">10 times as productive</a> as the average programmer. What people mean by this isn't that the best programmers write 10 times as many lines of code. Rather, it means that they're able to find clever solutions that allow them to accomplish more with fewer lines of code.</p> \n<p>Some of this is about innate intelligence, but in my experience a bigger factor is that the best programmers spend a huge amount of time absorbing technical information. With knowledge and experience about a broader range of software tools and programming techniques, they're more likely to know about the perfect tool for the job at hand.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true""><span>Employees who log more hours are broadening their experience </span><span>in a way that will make them more productive in the future</span></q></p> \n<p>And a similar point applies to workers who serve other roles — like marketers and product managers — at a company like Amazon. In a dynamic industry, it takes constant effort to keep up with what Amazon and its competitors are doing. Employees who log more hours aren't just accomplishing more this week; they're also broadening their experience in a way that will make them more productive in the future.</p> \n<p>Of course, there are diminishing returns to longer work hours. Beyond a certain point, you're so exhausted that you get much less done than you think you do. But some people find work at a company like Amazon so exciting that they don't mind putting in long hours — and they can set the pace for everyone else.</p> \n<h3>Smaller groups working longer hours are often more productive</h3> \n<p>You might wonder why instead of driving employees to the point of exhaustion, technology companies don't hire more employees to spread out the work. But this doesn't necessarily work.</p> \n<p>A famous programming aphorism known as <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooks%E2%80%99_law"">Brooks's law</a> explains why. It says that adding programmers to a late project makes it later. It was coined by Fred Brooks, who led one of history's first large-scale programming projects: the development of OS/360, an operating system for IBM computers in the 1960s. All the pieces of the software had to work well together, which meant that programmers on Brooks's team had to spend a lot of time talking to each other. Indeed, the larger the group, the larger the fraction of time each programmer had to spend talking to others.</p> \n<p>This is a big reason the most innovative software projects tend to be created by small groups. A 10-person team working 70-hour weeks is going to be a lot more productive than a 20-person team working 35-hour weeks, because the larger group is going to spend a lot more time sitting in meetings, arguing on mailing lists, and waiting to get answers from colleagues about how their respective parts of the software project will work together.</p> \n<p>The point applies to non-engineers too. The smaller a team is, the more efficiently it can work. Small teams require fewer meetings and less email discussions. They are less likely to be sidetracked by miscommunication or disagreement. They're more flexible and — ultimately — a lot more productive per person.</p> \n<h3>Amazon's white-collar workers have a lot of options</h3> \n<p>That said, there's more to life than working, and it would be pretty depressing to work in a world where working in technology required you to give up on having a personal life. But it's important to remember that most white-collar workers at a company like Amazon have plenty of job options.</p> \n<p>Vox's <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/8/17/9164339/amazons-work-culture"" target=""_blank"">Matt Yglesias writes</a> that he once talked to an Amazon executive who said, ""I did the best work of my life, far better than I ever felt possible, and I don't regret leaving at all.""</p> \n<p><q class=""right"" aria-hidden=""true""><span>Most white-collar workers at a company like Amazon have plenty of job options</span></q></p> \n<p>Life at a high-pressure company like Amazon can be exhilarating. Employees can make a lot of money, gain valuable skills, and be part of changing the world. Then if they find the long hours to be incompatible with other goals in their lives — like spending time with their families — they can switch to a less demanding job later in their career.</p> \n<p>Of course, some of the specific anecdotes in the Times story — like the ""woman who had thyroid cancer"" who ""was given a low performance rating after she returned from treatment"" — are indefensible, as Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos has <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/18/technology/amazon-bezos-workplace-management-practices.html"">acknowledged</a>. And there's more reason to be concerned about <a href=""http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/02/mac-mcclelland-free-online-shipping-warehouses-labor"">Amazon's treatment of low-wage workers</a> in its warehouses. But it's not a problem that a company would expect long hours from its best-paid employees. If they don't like it, they can find other jobs. And in the meantime, they might create some amazing products and services.</p>",Business & Finance
Bitcoin is on the verge of a constitutional crisis,http://www.vox.com/2015/8/18/9168977/bitcoin-constitutional-crisis,Bitcoin is facing one of its biggest challenges since its creation.,"<p>The Bitcoin community is facing one of the most momentous decisions in its six-year history. The Bitcoin network is running out of spare capacity, and two increasingly divided camps disagree about what, if anything, to do about the problem.</p> \n<p>If these two sides fail to reach a consensus, the Bitcoin network could — according to one side, at least — slowly grind to a halt as the number of transactions exceeds the network's capacity to process them. Even worse, if a fix for this problem is forced through prematurely, it could split the Bitcoin network in two and permanently damage public trust in the network.</p> \n<p>The argument is the closest thing the Bitcoin community has had to a constitutional crisis. Bitcoiners are trying to figure out who, if anyone, has the authority to make technical changes to the Bitcoin network's foundations. So far, neither side in the increasingly heated debate has shown much willingness to compromise.</p> \n<h3>The Bitcoin network is running out of capacity</h3> \n<p>The Bitcoin network processes transactions in units called ""blocks,"" which are created about every 10 minutes. To prevent malicious parties from clogging up the system with spam, the original Bitcoin software limited the size of each block to one megabyte, which corresponds to a few thousand transactions. When Bitcoin was created in 2009, that left plenty of room for growth.</p> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""3976606""><img src=""https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3976606/bitcoin_usage.png""></div> \n<p>But Bitcoin usage has been growing, bringing the network closer and closer to its maximum capacity. Right now, the network is only 30 to 40 percent full on average, but it sometimes gets congested during periods of high demand, causing delays for users. And if current growth continues, things could get a lot worse in the next year or two, as the network gets closer to 100 percent capacity.</p> \n<p>And if Bitcoin is going to become a mainstream payment platform, it's going to have to grow a lot more. Bitcoin handles tens of thousands of transactions per day. Visa handles tens of <em>millions</em>. To compete with Visa and other mainstream payment technologies, the network is going to need more capacity.</p> \n<h3>Changing the limit is easy — if everyone agrees</h3> \n<p>The limit is just a number in the Bitcoin software. If that number were changed to a higher value, the Bitcoin network would have more capacity.</p> \n<p>The difficulty is that this only works if everyone agrees to raise the limit. The Bitcoin network is built on consensus. If some parts of the Bitcoin network raise the limit and others don't, the network would be split in two. Having two competing versions of the Bitcoin network running simultaneously would be catastrophic. It would destroy trust in the Bitcoin network, since users could never be sure which transactions were official. And it would likely cause the value of bitcoins — the unit of currency — to plunge, as people questioned whether the network had a future at all.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""right""><span>Having two competing versions of the Bitcoin network running simultaneously would be catastrophic</span></q></p> \n<p>So this seemingly simple technical decision — whether to boost the Bitcoin network's capacity or not — has divided the Bitcoin community into warring camps. Two prominent Bitcoin developers, <a href=""https://medium.com/@octskyward/crash-landing-f5cc19908e32"" target=""_blank"">Mike Hearn</a> and <a href=""http://gavinandresen.ninja/time-to-roll-out-bigger-blocks"" target=""_blank"">Gavin Andresen</a>, lead the faction that wants to increase the capacity of the network, and they <a href=""http://cointelegraph.com/news/114612/major-payment-processors-in-favor-of-block-size-increase-coinkite-and-bitpagos-prefer-bip-100"">enjoy the support</a> of well-funded Bitcoin startups such as Coinbase and Bitpay.</p> \n<p>Their argument is simple: Bitcoin needs to grow if it's going to become a mainstream technology, and the current limit doesn't leave enough room for growth.</p> \n<p>But not everyone agrees with them.</p> \n<h3>Changing the limit could undermine what makes Bitcoin unique</h3> \n<p>Opponents of the proposal make two major arguments. One is that increasing the capacity of the network will lead to centralization of the Bitcoin system.</p> \n<p>Right now, Bitcoin transactions are processed in a parallel fashion by thousands of computers distributed around the internet. The Bitcoin network is designed in a clever way that prevents anyone from being able to control how it works — at least so long as no one controls a majority of the network's computing power.</p> \n<p>But as the volume of transactions has gone up, the number of computers participating in this transaction-processing task has gone down. And some critics worry that boosting the network's capacity will make it more expensive to participate in the process, further reducing the number of computers that participate. That, in turn, could make the system less reliable, or more vulnerable to attempts by governments or others to seize control of the network.</p> \n<p>When the Bitcoin network becomes congested, Bitcoin has a system of transaction fees that help bring supply and demand into balance.</p> \n<p>Some people want to simply let this mechanism work. They hope this will spur people to develop technical workarounds that allow transactions to be processed in ways that don't burden the primary Bitcoin network.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""right""><span>The rules of the Bitcoin software act as a kind of constitution for the Bitcoin community</span></q></p> \n<p>Lurking in the background is a larger philosophical disagreement. Bitcoin is built on the promise that many of its rules can never be changed. For example, the rules of Bitcoin say that there will never be more than 21 million bitcoins created. However, that's just a social convention — the people who write the Bitcoin software <em>could</em> decide to increase the rate at which new bitcoins are created so that many more wind up in circulation.</p> \n<p>In short, the rules of the Bitcoin software act as a kind of constitution for the Bitcoin community. And critics of raising Bitcoin's transaction limit worry that a hasty increase — or, perhaps, any increase at all — could undermine the public's trust that other aspects of the system won't be modified in the future.</p> \n<h3>No one knows what will happen next</h3> \n<p>While increasing the capacity of the Bitcoin network might seem like a minor change, it would be the first change made to the core rules of the Bitcoin network since it was launched in 2009. (Developers quickly fixed a <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/timothylee/2013/04/07/four-reasons-bitcoin-is-worth-studying/"">very minor bug</a> that briefly broke the network in 2013.) And there are no established rules for making this kind of change.</p> \n<p>As often happens, each side of the argument has developed its preferred talking points. Supporters of the higher limit present it as a matter of common sense. Opponents portray it as a power grab by a handful of prominent developers and deep-pocketed companies. There have been endless debates, proposals, and counterproposals about how to resolve the problem.</p> \n<p>Each side accuses the other of endangering the Bitcoin network. Proponents worry that the network will grind to a halt if the limit isn't raised in time. Opponents counter that it's reckless to foist a change on the Bitcoin community before a consensus is reached.</p> \n<p>Right now, the most popular Bitcoin software is an open-source project that's managed democratically by a <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://bitcoin.org/en/development"">five-person group of developers</a>. Andresen is a member of this group, but he hasn't been able to convince his colleagues to increase the limit. So he and Hearn have created <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://bitcoinxt.software/#sec-hardfork"">competing software</a>, Bitcoin XT, that supports a higher limit.</p> \n<p>Bitcoin XT is programmed so that it won't start supporting a higher transaction limit — breaking compatibility with the older software — until 75 percent of the Bitcoin network (as measured by computing power) adopts the new software. At that point, the other 25 percent of the network will risk being left behind if they don't switch. But we don't know if Hearn and Andresen can convince 75 percent of the network to switch. If they can't, we don't know what will happen next.</p> \n<p>Ultimately, how the dispute is resolved may matter more than the specific decision that's reached. If Hearn and Andresen's gambit is successful, it could become a template for resolving future arguments. On the other hand, if Bitcoin XT falls short and the warring camps can't reach a consensus, it could do lasting damage to Bitcoin's reputation.</p>",Business & Finance

New study argues hedge funds are an even worse scam than we thought,http://www.vox.com/2015/8/19/9177679/hedge-fund-tupitsyn-lajbcygier,"Most of them aren't even really hedging, and the ones that do are even worse than the fakes.","<p>Studies have shown, over and over again, that <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/2/24/8093957/hedge-fund-racket-chart"">hedge funds as a class provide investors with worse returns</a> than simple passive investment strategies.</p> \n<p>But a new study by <a href=""http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2642057"">Mikhail Tupitsyn and Paul Lajbcygier of Monash University</a> suggests that the ripoff is in some ways more fundamental than that — most hedge funds don't appear to be doing any hedging or active management at all.</p> \n<p>To reach that conclusion, the authors took a large set of hedge funds that deploy a variety of investment strategies and researched whether the funds exhibit linear or nonlinear returns relative to broader markets. The math behind this gets pretty funky, but the basic idea is that linear returns are simply proportional to what you could get with an index fund, whereas nonlinear returns aren't correlated with a simple index.</p> \n<p>The theory of a hedge fund, after all, is that it is going to employ some kind of active strategy that gets you a return that's <em>different</em> from just big overall market changes. What the authors find is that in most cases this doesn't happen: ""Over the long run many hedge funds behave like alternative beta portfolios and maintain linear exposures to systematic risk factors.""</p> \n<p>Think of how a recent, less technical study showed that Apple, Facebook, and Google are <a href=""http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2015/05/27/3-tech-stocks-hedge-funds-love-apple-inc-facebook.aspx"">three of the most widely held hedge fund investments</a>.</p> \n<p>These are great companies. And obviously the US high tech sector has done well recently. But owning funds that own stock in gigantic, famous technology companies is just earning you generic exposure to the tech sector minus huge management fees.</p> \n<p>The real punchline, though, is that not only is it rare for a hedge fund to have returns that are materially different from what a passive strategy could obtain, but the genuinely active minority exhibits <em>inferior</em> performance. ""The overall raw returns of nonlinear funds are 0.1 percent lower than returns of linear funds,"" the authors find.</p> \n<p>In other words, if you buy into a hedge fund hoping to take advantage of an active management strategy, you probably aren't going to get one. And if you <em>do</em> manage to obtain nonlinear exposure to broader market risk, you're going to be even worse off than you would have been if you failed. In other words, even if you're rich enough to gain access to exotic investment materials, you want to follow the same basic investing advice as anyone else — <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/10/30/7083499/you-should-be-saving-more"">make sure to save enough</a>, <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/8/3/5962625/the-case-for-investing-in-stocks-in-two-charts"">own stocks for the long term</a>, and <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/2/24/8093957/hedge-fund-racket-chart"">stick to passive strategies</a> rather than trying to beat the market.</p> \n<hr> \n<h3>VIDEO: How the rich stole the recovery</h3> \n<!--  ########  BEGIN VOLUME VIDEO  ########  --> \n<div data-volume-id=""324"" data-analytics-placement=""entry:middle"" data-volume-placement=""article"" id=""volume-placement-7815"" class=""volume-video"" data-volume-uuid=""002e9938e"" data-analytics-label=""Chart: How the rich stole the recovery | 324"" data-analytics-action=""volume:view:entry:middle"" data-analytics-viewport=""video""></div> \n<!--  ########  END VOLUME VIDEO  ########  -->",Business & Finance
4 charts that show how today's tech boom is different from the 1990s,http://www.vox.com/2015/8/19/9178837/ipo-decline-microsoft-facebook,"In the 1990s, the IPO was a right of passage for tech startups. That's not true anymore.","<p>Many people date the start of the 1990s technology boom to August 9, 1995, the date Netscape had its initial public offering. At this point, the company was just 15 months old, yet it was already offering its shares to the public for anyone to buy. After the offering, Netscape's stock surged, valuing the company at more than $2 billion at the end of the first day of trading.</p> \n<p>The IPO became a rite of passage for technology startups during the 1990s. Some of today's technology giants, including Amazon, Yahoo, and eBay, had their IPOs in the late 1990s. Lots of other companies held IPOs and then imploded when the market crashed.</p> \n<p>Today Silicon Valley is booming again, but there's been a big change in the way technology companies are financed: Technology startups are increasingly turning to rich insiders, rather than the general public, to finance their growth. Here are <a href=""http://ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2015/6/15/us-tech-funding"" target=""_blank"">four charts from Benedict Evans</a>, of the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, that show how the finances of Silicon Valley have changed.</p> \n<h3>1) There are a lot fewer technology IPOs today than in the 1990s</h3> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""3981534""><img src=""https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3981534/ipos_down.png""></div> \n<p>Both the number of technology IPOs and their value are down dramatically from the 1990s. Indeed, over the past decade the number of IPOs has been below the level of the early 1980s — though the amount of money raised has been higher.</p> \n<h3>2) Technology startups are turning to private funding sources instead</h3> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""3981552""><img src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3981552/ipo_vs_private.png""></div> \n<p>IPOs aren't becoming less common because people have stopped investing in technology companies. Rather, technology startups are increasingly turning to private sources — venture capital firms, private equity firms, and so forth — for funding instead of offering their stock to the general public. These private sources of funding have always been an important part of Silicon Valley, but recently they've become the dominant way technology companies raise money.</p> \n<p>In some cases, technology companies only turn to the public markets when they're forced to by government regulators. The Securities and Exchange Commission effectively requires companies to go public when the number of shareholders exceeds 500. The rule was a big reason Facebook had its IPO in 2012.</p> \n<h3>3) Later IPOs means fewer opportunities — and risks — for non-wealthy investors</h3> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""3981774""><img src=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3981774/public_private_returns.png""></div> \n<p>An investor who bought $1,000 of Microsoft stock shortly after the company's 1986 IPO and held it for the next decade would have wound up with more than $100,000 by the late 1990s. And as this chart shows, big post-IPO gains (represented by the gray bars) weren't that unusual in the 1980s and 1990s.</p> \n<p>Things have been different in the new century. Facebook was already worth $100 billion at the time of its IPO in 2012. Since then, the stock has more than doubled, providing investors with a pretty good return. But there's no chance that people who invested in Facebook at the time of the IPO will see their funds grow by a factor of 100. Apple, the most valuable company in the world, is worth around $700 billion — less than seven times Facebook's IPO price.</p> \n<p>And the story is the same with other recent technology IPOs. Companies are waiting a lot longer to do their IPOs, leaving public investors with much less potential upside. And because non-wealthy people are <a href=""http://edgar.sec.gov/answers/accred.htm"">legally prohibited</a> from investing in private companies, that means most people have fewer opportunities to make high-risk, high-reward investments than they did two decades ago. Of course, that also means there's less risk that these investors will lose their life savings betting on unproven technology stocks.</p> \n<h3>4) Stock prices don't reflect a technology bubble</h3> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""3981802""><img src=""https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3981802/no_tech_bubble.png""></div> \n<p>The value of technology stocks has been soaring recently, causing some people to worry that we're in the middle of another technology bubble. But this chart shows that when you compare tech stock prices to company earnings, recent stock price increases look downright tame.</p> \n<p>In the 1990s, technology stock prices soared without any corresponding rise in technology company earnings. When the market realized that companies couldn't possibly deliver on the absurd expectations implied by these high prices, the market crashed. Today, by contrast, stock price increases are largely being driven by growing technology company profits. As a percentage of earnings, technology stocks are actually a bit cheaper than they were five, 10, or 20 years ago.</p>",Business & Finance
People are underestimating Snapchat just like they underestimated Facebook,http://www.vox.com/2015/8/20/9180107/snapchat-losing-money-billion,"Snapchat lost a lot of money in 2014, but its future looks bright.","<p>Gawker's Sam Biddle has obtained internal financials showing that between January and November 2014, Snapchat had revenues of just $3 million while posting a net loss of $128 million. Biddle asks: ""How in the hell did it <a href=""http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-11/alibaba-said-to-plan-snapchat-funding-at-15-billion-valuation"">convince investors it was worth $15 billion</a>?""</p> \n<p>The Washington Post's Brian Fung <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2015/08/19/snapchats-leaked-financials-show-just-how-big-a-bullet-facebook-dodged/"">shares Biddle's skepticism</a>, suggesting that Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg dodged a bullet when Snapchat turned down a $3 billion acquisition offer and writing that Snapchat ""lacks a clear road to profitability.""</p> \n<p>But it's actually pretty easy to see how Snapchat could wind up being profitable.</p> \n<p>In fact, almost every one of today's big internet companies — Yahoo, Google, Facebook, and Twitter — faced similar skepticism in their early years. Back in 2007, Kara Swisher (who now runs Re/code which, like Vox.com, is part of Vox Media) <a href=""http://allthingsd.com/20070925/15-billion-more-reasons-to-worry-about-facebook/"">expressed astonishment</a> that Facebook could be worth $15 billion. A year before that, a <a href=""http://www.slate.com/articles/business/moneybox/2006/09/1_billion_for_facebook_lol.html"" target=""_blank"">Slate headline</a> read ""$1 Billion for Facebook? LOL!"" (Facebook is now worth $260 billion.)</p> \n<p>Then each of these sites <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/7/29/5949647/why-we-shouldnt-be-surprised-about-twitters-rapid-revenue-growth"">made a ton of money</a> with advertising. With hundreds of millions of users, they've been able to generate billions of dollars in revenue. Facebook, Google, and Yahoo have all generated big profits. Twitter hasn't turned a profit yet, but it generated $1.4 billion in revenue in 2014 and is on track to take in more this year.</p> \n<p>Snapchat is following the roadmap laid out by its predecessors. Facebook's ad revenue was paltry until it <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/23/technology/23soft.html?_r=0"">signed an ad deal</a> with Microsoft in 2006. Twitter waited until 2010 to <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/13/technology/internet/13twitter.html"">announce its advertising plan</a>. Both companies' advertising revenues surged as their user bases and sales forces grew.</p> \n<p>So there's every reason to think Snapchat's ad revenues will be large once the company has finished building its ad-sales machine. Snapchat says it has <a href=""http://qz.com/412201/snapchat-says-its-100-million-users-are-watching-2-billion-mobile-videos-a-day/"">100 million daily users</a> who watch 2 billion mobile videos a day. This is a hard figure to compare with other sites, which measure their audience in different ways. But at worst, that makes Snapchat a third the size of Twitter, which has about 300 million <em>monthly</em> active users. Twitter is worth $19 billion, suggesting Snapchat would be worth at least $6 billion.</p> \n<p>Of course, Twitter's growth has stalled, whereas Snapchat may still be growing quickly. The data leaked to Biddle doesn't give user growth numbers, so we can't estimate how big Snapchat will be in a year or two. But it's not crazy to think the 4-year-old app might still have significant growth ahead of it.</p> \n<p>A company's early ad revenue just doesn't tell us anything interesting about its long-term earnings potential. It takes a while for a company to hire a sales team, settle on an effective advertising format, and build awareness among potential customers.</p> \n<p>But while it might take time for Snapchat to build a successful advertising program, there's little doubt that it will be able to. Every day, 100 million people open up the Snapchat app. As long as that's true, advertisers are going to be willing to pay top dollar to reach them.</p>",Business & Finance
This chart shows how federal housing policy benefits the rich more than the poor,http://www.vox.com/2015/8/22/9182441/housing-tax-breaks-regressive,Housing tax breaks for the rich are worth more than housing subsidies for the poor.,"<p>If you take out a mortgage to buy a house, the federal tax code lets you deduct your interest payments from your taxable income. People can also deduct state and local property taxes from their federal income taxes.</p> \n<p>Both of these tax deductions tend to be larger for rich people, who tend to have more expensive houses. And rich people are also in higher tax brackets, making every dollar deducted worth more. As a result, these tax breaks provide the biggest financial benefit to the wealthiest taxpayers. The Urban Institute's John McGinty, Benjamin Chartoff, and Pamela Blumenthal have <a href=""http://www.urban.org/urban-wire/visualizing-housing-policys-impact-inequality"">created a helpful chart</a> showing just how big these tax breaks get.</p> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""3984844""><img src=""https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3984844/housing_subsidies.png""></div> \n<p>The blue bars show the value of these tax breaks for different income brackets. They can be compared with subsidies the federal government provides to low-income people to help them afford housing — represented by the yellow bar. As you can see, the tax breaks provided to the richest Americans, on a per-person basis, dwarf the value of housing subsidies provided to those with low incomes.</p> \n<p>But the combined effect of these policies is to hurt the middle class the most. Most households in the middle of the income distribution are too wealthy to qualify for federal housing subsidies. At the same time, they tend to have relatively small houses and be in low tax brackets, so they don't get much benefit from housing-related tax breaks.</p> \n<p>If policymakers wanted to make housing tax breaks more progressive, they could make them work more like the student loan interest deduction. The deduction is capped at $2,500, and is phased out altogether for high earners.</p>",Business & Finance
Greek crisis: Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras resigns and calls new elections,http://www.vox.com/2015/8/20/9183451/greek-election-2015-tsipras,The next chapter in the Greek crisis unfolds.,"<p>Greek politics is back in the headlines this week. After Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras signed a controversial austerity deal with European leaders earlier this summer, he faced a left-wing rebellion that cost him his parliamentary majority. That created a political crisis for Tsipras and his Cabinet, so he's calling for new elections on September 20.</p> \n<p>If you're tired of reading about Greece versus Germany and eurozone debt considerations, never fear — this almost certainly does <em>not</em> represent a resurgence of a Europe-wide political crisis.</p> \n<p>Quite the reverse. All signs are that the election will completely marginalize the Greek left, <em>and</em> the old establishment political parties, making Tsipras the absolute master of the scene and giving him freedom to implement the deal.</p> \n<h3>Can you remind me how we got here?</h3> \n<p>Sure. In brief:</p> \n<ul> \n<li>The Greek government was deeply in debt, largely though not exclusively to private banks owned by foreigners.</li> \n<li>By 2010, it became clear that Greece could not pay what it owed.</li> \n<li>Other European states let Greece pay off those debts by giving Greece a bunch of new loans at an interest rate far below what Greece would have paid on the private market.</li> \n<li>In exchange, Greece had to reduce its budget deficit and also agree to a package of economic policy reforms.</li> \n<li>This was deeply unpopular in Greece, and the Greek economy performed very poorly. So in 2015 a previously marginal left-wing political party called Syriza swept into power promising to generate a better outcome.</li> \n<li>After months of sporadic negotiations and then a couple of weeks of intense crisis, Syriza failed to get a better deal and <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/7/10/8931729/greek-parliament-passes-austerity/in/8625476"">Tsipras essentially capitulated to creditor demands</a>.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>As you might expect, abandoning all of Syriza's main campaign pledges was somewhat controversial inside the party. Many Syriza leaders, especially those associated with the inter-party group called the Left Platform, opposed the pirouette.</p> \n<p>The terms of the agreement between Greece and its creditors require various parliamentary votes to implement various changes. This week, enough Syriza MPs began defecting that Tsipras could only secure a majority for his proposals by relying on votes from the center-right New Democracy party. In Greece's parliamentary system, that made Tsipras's position untenable, so he has called for new elections.</p> \n<h3>So Tsipras alienated everyone and is now doomed, right?</h3> \n<p>Quite the opposite! To many foreign observers, Tsipras's tenure in office has been a complete catastrophe. He's <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/7/13/8949925/greece-syriza/in/8625476"">incurred m</a><a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/7/13/8949925/greece-syriza/in/8625476"">a</a><a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/7/13/8949925/greece-syriza/in/8625476"">ny of the costs that would be involved in Greece leaving the Eurozone altogether</a> but secured none of the benefits. He put Europe through months of wrangling and the Greek economy through a terrifying week of near-collapse, all just to secure a deal he could have had in February. He's broken all his campaign pledges, and seemingly abandoned the agenda that made him popular in the first place.</p> \n<p>But Syriza is enjoying an <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_legislative_election,_September_2015#Vote"">18 to 20 percent lead in the polls</a> over New Democracy, and <a href=""http://www.wsj.com/articles/greek-prime-minister-alexis-tsipras-remains-popular-despite-tough-bailout-deal-1437563249"">Tsipras personally has a 60 percent approval rating</a>.</p> \n<p> </p> \n<blockquote class=""twitter-tweet"" lang=""en""> \n<p lang=""en"" dir=""ltr"">September snap election could look very bad for the Left: Left Platform will be pushed from party lists, hard to be viable outside party too</p> \n— Bhaskar Sunkara (@sunraysunray) <a href=""https://twitter.com/sunraysunray/status/634394276680462337"">August 20, 2015</a>\n</blockquote> \n<p> </p> \n<p> \n<script src=""//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"" charset=""utf-8""></script> \n</p> \n<p>Unless something changes dramatically in the next month, new elections should cement his status as Greece's dominant political figure.

Absent a constituency for leaving the Euro, there's no viable left alternative to Tsipras.</li> \n<li> <b>The mainstream parties are completely discredited.</b> Point one tends to indicate that the government Tsipras beat back in January — a grand coalition between New Democracy and the center-left party Pasok — was actually not nearly as bad as Tsipras said it was back then. But the collapse of the Greek economy since 2008 and the revelations about the scale of government borrowing before then have managed to massively discredit those parties. Pasok's entire constituency has basically vanished in favor of Syriza, and New Democracy remains badly tainted by past failures.</li> \n<li> <b>Tsipras is a fighter.</b> Greek voters appear to appreciate how far Tsipras was willing to push the limits in pursuit of a better deal. There's a sense that perhaps Greece's two previous prime ministers — ND's Antonis Samaras and Pasok's George Papandreou  — were a little <em>too</em> eager to please European partners and the global financial community. Tsipras gets credit for genuinely trying his best. </li> \n</ol> \n<h3>What time is the Greek election?</h3> \n<p>The vote is on September 20.</p>",Business & Finance

Steve Jobsâ€™ best advice for managers,http://www.vox.com/2015/2/28/8124303/steve-jobs-best-advice-for-managers,"""You don't care about how they feel! You're being vain, you want them to like you.""","<p>On Wednesday, Apple's lead designer, Jony Ive, was promoted to Chief Design Officer.

Jobs replied, ""Why would you be vague?,"" arguing that ambiguity was a form of selfishness: ""You don't care about how they feel! You're being vain, you want them to like you."" Ive was furious, but came to agree. ""It's really demeaning to think that, in this deep desire to be liked, you've compromised giving clear, unambiguous feedback,"" he said.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>You can take this insight too far, and if the stories about Jobs are any indication, he almost certainly did. But in trying to separate the tales of Jobs' brutality from his legendary effectiveness as a manager, this is probably a good place to start. Jobs was able to give his employees something many managers can't: clear feedback. And that's because he understood something that many managers don't: it's actually unpleasant to work for a manager who desperately wants to be liked:</p> \n<center> \n<p><iframe width=""480"" height=""360"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/AZ3v7V2CZu8"" frameborder=""0""></iframe></p> \n</center>",Business & Finance
"Warren Buffett explains how taxes, Wall Street greed, and executive ego help him get rich",http://www.vox.com/2015/3/2/8130295/warren-buffett-shareholder-letter,3 structural advantages for Berkshire-Hathaway.,"<p>Warren Buffett's annual messages to the shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway are always full of interesting observations about the business world. This year he treated us to a brief explanation of how the tax code, the predatory instincts of Wall Street, and the frailties of human nature create an opportunity for him to make money:</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>At Berkshire, we can — without incurring taxes or much in the way of other costs — move huge sums from businesses that have limited opportunities for incremental investment to other sectors with greater promise. Moreover, we are free of historical biases created by lifelong association with a given industry and are not subject to pressures from colleagues having a vested interest in maintaining the status quo. That’s important: If horses had controlled investment decisions, there would have been no auto industry.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>What he's saying is that some businesses are profitable, some businesses are promising. Coal mines, for example, make money. But solar power is exhibiting more potential for growth. There's money to be made in shifting funds from the profitable businesses to the promising ones.</p> \n<p>Shifting money from profitable businesses to promising businesses is what financial markets are supposed to do. But, Buffet says, there are three impediments that make it harder to do this — impediments that his company is in a unique position to overcome:</p> \n<ul> \n<li> <em>Taxes:</em> A profitable company can pay dividends, flushing cash out to its owners. Its owners could then invest their money in promising new businesses. But the government makes the shareholders pay taxes on those dividends. By owning a diverse array of unrelated businesses, Berkshire can simply shift money from the profitable ones to the promising ones without needing to pay taxable dividends. Buffett is known as an advocate of the ""Buffett rule""  that would make very rich people pay higher tax rates on their dividend and capital gains income. This would be costly for Buffett personally, but improve the outlook for his business. </li> \n<li> <em>Wall Street:</em> Even without taxes, reallocating capital normally faces the significant problem that Wall Street intermediaries grab lots of the money for themselves. That's the ""other costs"" that Buffett is talking about. The services of investment bankers, <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/2/24/8093957/hedge-fund-racket-chart"">hedge fund managers</a>, and <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/2/6/7983147/mutual-fund-rip-off"">even mutual funds</a> don't come cheaply. Allocating capital is often more lucrative for the people in a position to grab some of the money flying around the room than it is for the people whose money is being thrown. That's why for  normal people <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/7/31/5882885/retirement-planning-saving-how-much-do-i-need"">passive investments are usually best</a>. Buffett can shift money between his different operations without paying middlemen.</li> \n<li> <em>Ego:</em> This is arguably the biggest one. When profitable companies get interested in investing in new businesses, they tend to want to find <em>related</em> industries. So Microsoft has turned its Windows and Office profits into the XBox, Bing, Windows Phone, and other <em>technology</em> businesses. Buffett says it is more lucrative to invest across the whole range of businesses, without regard to adjacencies or synergies or anything else. Since his company is a pure holding company rather than an effort to actually manage anything, it's easy to be objective and dispassionate.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Of course these structural explanations for Berkshire-Hathaway's success only take you some far. Picking the right investments is still hard. But Buffett's letter is a reminder that his success isn't just skill or luck, it's also based on some big structural factors.</p>",Business & Finance
Ikea furniture will soon charge your cell phone wirelessly,http://www.vox.com/2015/3/2/8135573/ikea-wireless-cell-charging,Ikea is throwing its weight behind one of two competing wireless charging standards.,"<p>The furniture giant Ikea has <a href=""http://www.cnet.com/news/ikea-to-sell-furniture-that-can-wirelessly-charge-your-phone/"">announced</a> a new line of furniture with built-in wireless charging pads. If you have a compatible phone, you can set it on top of the pad, and it will draw power without having to plug anything in.</p> \n<p>Ikea is entering the market with a range of products including tables, desks, and lamps, which will go on sale in the United States on April 15.</p> \n<p>Many cell phones already support wireless charging, and this is expected to become a standard feature in the next few years. But a big obstacle to widespread adoption is the lack of a universal industry standard. There are two competing technologies, and phones designed for one won't work with charging pads built with the other.</p> \n<h3>Ikea is getting involved in a standards war</h3> \n<p>Wireless charging will only work if your smartphone supports the same charging standard as the charging station. And right now, there are two different wireless standards being developed, each with a roster of influential companies behind it (Some major vendors, including LG and HTC, are members of both groups.):</p> \n<p><span> </span></p> \n<ul> \n<li> <span>Two industry</span><strong style=""font-size: 1.15em;""> </strong><span>groups called the Alliance for Wireless Power and the Power Matters Alliance </span><a href=""http://www.cnet.com/news/key-wireless-charging-groups-a4wp-pma-agree-to-merge/"" style=""font-size: 1.15em; background-color: #ffffff;"">merged</a><span> back in January with the aim of creating a new industry standard. This coalition enjoys the support of Samsung, Intel, Qualcomm, Duracell, and other companies. The PMA has a charging station called the Powermat, but it will likely be superseded by a new standard that the new group will create.</span> </li> \n<li> <span>Ikea chose to go with an opposing group called the </span><a href=""http://www.wirelesspowerconsortium.com/member-list/"" style=""font-size: 1.15em; background-color: #ffffff;"">Wireless Power Consortium</a><span>. It's supported by Verizon, Philips, Nokia, and several other companies. The group is backing a standard called Qi that is already supported</span><strong style=""font-size: 1.15em;""> </strong><span>by </span><a href=""http://www.qinside.biz/en/support/qi-enabled-phones"" style=""font-size: 1.15em; background-color: #ffffff;"">dozens of devices</a><span> from Samsung, HTC, and other companies.</span> </li> \n</ul> \n<p> </p> \n<ol> </ol> \n<p>This battle is of interest not only to device makers, but also retail establishments that might offer charging stations. For example, Starbucks has <a href=""http://news.starbucks.com/news/starbucks-begins-national-roll-out-of-powermat-wireless-charging"">signed on</a> to offer Powermat charging stations in its San Francisco stores.</p> \n<p>Ikea joining the Wireless Power Consortium is a bit of a risk because it means that if the Alliance for Wireless Power eventually prevails, the charging stations in Ikea's furniture could quickly become obsolete. Then again, Ikea's support could help the Wireless Power Consortium win.</p> \n<p>This kind of standards battle isn't uncommon. Thirty years ago consumers had to choose between the VHS and Betamax standards for VCRs (VHS eventually won). More recently, there was a fight between the HD-DVD and Blu-Ray standards for high-definition video discs (Blu-Ray won).</p> \n<p>At some point in the next few years, we can expect this race to reach a tipping point, where a critical mass of companies endorse one standard and support for the other one collapses. That means winning a prominent supporter like Ikea is a big deal because it increases the chances that the WPC will prevail.</p>",Business & Finance
Why Clinton's private email account was a danger to national security,http://www.vox.com/2015/3/4/8149057/clinton-email-national-security,Building a homebrew email system makes it more vulnerable to attacks from foreign governments.,"<p>Most of the criticism following the revelation that Hillary Clinton used a personal email account for official business as Secretary of State has been based on suspicions that she was trying to evade transparency laws that require federal officials to preserve their  communications.</p> \n<p>But the more serious problem with Clinton's do-it-yourself approach to email isn't about transparency. It's about national security. Creating a secure email system is difficult, and it's unlikely that Clinton's homebrew email system was as secure as the official email system that would have been provided to her by the State Department.</p> \n<p>That means that for four years — years when she was involved in numerous high-stakes negotiations — she was communicating in a way that made it easier for foreign intelligence services to keep tabs on her. We don't know if any foreign spy agencies took advantage of this opportunity. But it was reckless to give them the opportunity.</p> \n<h3>Running a secure email service is hard</h3> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/assets/4694751/57585409.jpg"" alt=""NSA via Getty Images"" data-chorus-asset-id=""646864""></p> \n<p> </p> \n<p class=""caption"">National Security Agency headquarters in Ft. Meade, MD. (NSA)</p> \n<p> </p> \n<p>According to an <a href=""http://bigstory.ap.org/article/b78ba433af3a45209668f745158d994c/clinton-ran-homebrew-computer-system-official-emails"">Associated Press story</a> published this morning, Hillary Clinton didn't just have her own, private email address. She set up a private system to host her email. The AP suggests this server may even have been located in her house in New York.</p> \n<p>Running a secure online service is difficult no matter who you are. Online security is an arms race: hackers are constantly discovering new security flaws, while software makers are rushing to patch them before they can be used to hack into vulnerable software. This is why big software companies like Google and Microsoft have <a href=""https://cloud.google.com/files/Google-CommonSecurity-WhitePaper-v1.4.pdf"">hundreds of people</a> on staff who do nothing but deal with security threats.</p> \n<p>Most people who run their own email servers have one big advantage: no one is likely to target them personally. But of course Hillary Clinton wasn't an ordinary person between 2009 and 2013. She was the top diplomat of the most powerful country in the world. Every foreign intelligence service on the planet was interested in her private communications.</p> \n<p>And securing a server against foreign governments is a lot more difficult than securing it against garden-variety hackers. Foreign countries like China and Russia <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/chinese-hackers-who-breached-google-gained-access-to-sensitive-data-us-officials-say/2013/05/20/51330428-be34-11e2-89c9-3be8095fe767_story.html"">have their own versions</a> of the National Security Agency — agencies full of smart hackers who have spent years studying how to break into computer systems. It's likely that these governments — <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2013/08/31/the-nsa-hacks-other-countries-by-buying-millions-of-dollars-worth-of-computer-vulnerabilities/"">like the NSA</a> — have an inventory of security vulnerabilities that haven't yet been discovered by the broader hacker community (information about flaws in popular software can be purchased in underground markets).</p> \n<p>And while the federal government is not generally known for its IT savvy, the feds <em>do</em> take IT seriously when it comes to issues of national security. It's likely the NSA has worked with the State Department to ensure that agency's email is as secure as possible.</p> \n<p>We asked a Clinton spokesman if she had taken measures to secure the domain against foreign attackers. He answered with a single word: ""absolutely."" But he didn't provide details.</p> \n<p>Of course, it's possible that Clinton hired a small army of computer security experts to administer her server, and they made it just as secure as Gmail or the State Department's email system. But it's not very likely. And more to the point, it would have been hard for Clinton — who is not, herself, an expert on computer security — to know whether she had taken sufficient precautions.</p> \n<h3>It doesn't matter if Clinton sent out classified information</h3> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3469282/109916598.0.jpg"" alt=""109916598.0.jpg"" data-chorus-asset-id=""3469282""></p> \n<p> </p> \n<p class=""caption"">Knowing which aides have a Secretary of State's ear during negotiations can be a powerful advantage. (Jonathan Ernst/Getty Images)</p> \n<p> </p> \n<p>The Clinton camp has emphasized that Clinton did not send any classified information from her personal email address. Even if this is true, it doesn't excuse Clinton's decision to use a personal email address for official business.</p> \n<p>During her time as Secretary of State, Clinton was intimately involved in a wide variety of sensitive negotiations with foreign governments. In this type of high-stakes negotiation, seemingly mundane information can provide valuable insights.</p> \n<p>For example, the tone of emails she sent could give insight into the Secretary's mood, which could inform decisions about when to push for a deal and when to delay negotiations. Information about how frequently Clinton met with different aides could give insight into whose advice she trusted most (and therefore what the US negotiating posture was likely to be). Similarly, information about which domestic interest groups got meetings with the Secretary could provide valuable information about US priorities.</p> \n<p>In short, knowledge is power. By creating her own personal email server, Clinton took the risk that America's adversaries could gain invaluable information about her private communications. That was a big mistake.</p>",Business & Finance
Mattress stores want to rip you off. Here's how to fight back.,http://www.vox.com/2015/3/5/8151607/mattress-buying-tips-savings,Here's how to figure out how much a mattress is really worth. And how to opt out of the mattress-haggling game altogether.,"<p>At Walmart, Best Buy, or Whole Foods, the listed price on any item is usually what you pay.<strong> </strong>You might be able to get a discount with a coupon, but asking store employees for a discount generally won't work.</p> \n<p>But not every industry works like this. Haggling is common in expensive industries, like car and jewelry sales. Because customers don't participate in these markets very often, there's less incentive to win customer loyalty with fair and transparent pricing, and more opportunities to dupe unsophisticated buyers into overpaying.</p> \n<p>Or take the mattress industry. It's notorious for inflated prices, confusing branding, and gimmicks that trick consumers into overpaying.</p> \n<p>Yet underpaying for a mattress can also be a big problem. After all, most people spend about eight hours per day — that's a third of their life — sleeping. And a good mattress will last a decade or more. So it's worth investing in a mattress that will help you wake up well rested every morning.</p> \n<p>So how do you buy a mattress that will help you get a good night's sleep without getting ripped off? Read on for details.</p> \n<h3>Knowledge is power</h3> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""3470914"" alt=""454355978.0.jpg"" src=""https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3470914/454355978.0.jpg""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Sleepy's is one of the nation's largest mattress chains. (John Greim/LightRocket via Getty Images)</p> \n<p>Mattress salespeople's power comes from the fact that they know what a fair price is for each mattress and you don't. Many mattress stores invent hugely inflated ""standard"" retail prices and then offer ""discounts"" that still price the mattress way above its actual cost. Department stores are particularly notorious for this.</p> \n<p>For example, a price tag might claim that a mattress normally costs $3,000 but is currently available for 60 percent off at $1,200. In reality, no one ever pays $3,000; $1,200 <em>is</em> the regular price. And if you negotiate effectively, you'll be able to get it for hundreds of dollars less.</p> \n<p>As with any negotiation, the key to getting a better deal is to demonstrate that you know the product's real value and won't pay more. The easiest way to do that is by playing brick-and-mortar stores against online ones.</p> \n<p>Once you find a mattress you like at a brick-and-mortar mattress store, use your favorite search engine to find the lowest price for that same mattress from an internet retailer. If you have a smartphone, you might be able to do this right in the store, though it might make sense to go home, do your research on a PC, and then go back to the store.</p> \n<p>Once you know the best price offered by competitors, ask the salesperson to beat it. He or she might say no, in which case you can go to another store or just order online. But most stores will agree to match the price.</p> \n<h3>Mattress stores make price comparisons unnecessarily difficult</h3> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""3470924"" alt=""5210277791_d8eceff1b1_b.0.jpg"" src=""https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3470924/5210277791_d8eceff1b1_b.0.jpg""></p> \n<p> </p> \n<p> </p> \n<p class=""caption""><span>(</span><a href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/amberlrhea/5210277791"" target=""_blank"">Amber Rhea</a><span>)</span></p> \n<p> </p> \n<p>Of course, the mattress industry hates this kind of comparison shopping. To discourage it, some mattress manufacturers will give the same mattress different names in different stores.</p> \n<p>For example, the popular Simmons Beautyrest line has different brand names at different stores. The <a href=""http://www1.macys.com/shop/product/beautyrest-recharge-allie-firm-tight-top-mattress-sets?ID=2067669&amp;CategoryID=25931&amp;LinkshareID=iKgX8FN3UAI-AZLn8MTkKBNDlW64NG233g&amp;PartnerID=LINKSHARE&amp;cm_mmc=LINKSHARE-_-5-_-63-_-MP563"" target=""_blank"">""Beautyrest Recharge Allie""</a> at Macy's is called the <a href=""http://www.sears.com/beautyrest-devonwood-luxury-firm-queen-mattress-set/p-082CO80272912B?prdNo=2&amp;blockNo=2&amp;blockType=G2&amp;sid=I0084400010000100600&amp;aff=Y&amp;PID=7566101&amp;AID=11569691"" target=""_blank"">""Beautyrest Recharge Devonwood Luxury""</a> at Sears, the <a href=""http://www.mattressfirm.com/simmons-beautyrest-recharge-signature-select-hartfield-11-5-luxury-firm-mattress.aspx"" target=""_blank"">""Recharge Signature Select Hartfield""</a> at Mattress Firm, and the <a href=""http://www.us-mattress.com/clear-ovmb061527.html"" target=""_blank"">""Beautyrest Recharge Lyric Luxury""</a> at US-Mattress.com. If customers don't realize these are names for the same mattress, it's harder for them to bargain effectively.</p> \n<p>Fortunately, this kind of obfuscation isn't too hard to overcome. Often you'll be able to <a href=""http://www.mattressnerd.com/beautyrest-recharge-2015-comparison-chart/"" target=""_blank"">find charts online</a> that tell you exactly which mattress models are equivalent. Otherwise, you should be able to figure it out by comparing features. US-Mattress.com, for example, says that the Beautyrest Recharge Lyric Luxury has 1 1/4 inches of AirFeel foam, an inch of AirCool foam, a half inch of GelTouch foam, one inch of energy foam, 476 ""800-series"" coils, and so forth. Ask your brick-and-mortar store for this kind of information on the mattress you want, and then find prices for similar mattresses from online retailers.</p> \n<h3>Make sure the store has a good return policy</h3> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""3470916"" alt=""158730595.0.jpg"" src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3470916/158730595.0.jpg""></p> \n<p> </p> \n<p style=""text-align: start;"" class=""caption"">(Andrew Burton/Getty)</p> \n<p> </p> \n<p>One thing that makes mattress shopping hard is that there's no fast, foolproof way to tell if a particular mattress is going to be comfortable. The only way to be sure is to spend a lot of time on it.</p> \n<p>Experts recommend setting aside several hours for mattress shopping. Bring a book to the mattress store and spend about 15 minutes lying on each bed.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""right""><span>mattress salespeople's power comes from the fact that they know what a fair price is for each mattress and you don't</span></q></p> \n<p>But even a leisurely in-store evaluation period won't guarantee that it will be comfortable for a full night's sleep. So you want to make sure that you can return a mattress if it proves less comfortable in your bedroom than it seemed in the store.</p> \n<p>Stores' return policies differ dramatically. Many charge hefty fees. Some charge as much as half the price of the original mattress to swap it out for a new one. So before you agree to buy a mattress, make sure you understand its return policy.</p> \n<p>Totally free returns are fairly rare, because it costs money to send a truck to retrieve the old mattress and bring a new one. But if a company charges high fees for returning a mattress, that's a reason to call around to see if another store will offer a more generous return policy.</p> \n<p>Mattresses also come with separate warranties provided by the manufacturer. These generally range from 5 to 20 years. Longer warranties may be a sign of quality, but don't put too much stock into warranties longer than 10 years, since it's a good practice to replace your mattress after a decade of use.</p> \n<h3>Consider buying a ""bed in a box""</h3> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""3470926"" alt=""Casper_Team2.0.jpg"" src=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3470926/Casper_Team2.0.jpg""></p> \n<p> </p> \n<p class=""caption"">Casper's cofounders on a Casper bed. CEO Philip Krim is in the center. (Casper)</p> \n<p> </p> \n<p>We don't think of the mattress industry as a hotbed of innovation, but the last two years have seen the emergence of a new generation of direct-to-customer mattress companies. The most famous of these companies is <a href=""https://casper.com/"">Casper</a>, but it faces competition from <a href=""https://www.tuftandneedle.com/"">Tuft and Needle</a> and <a href=""http://www.leesa.com/"">Leesa</a>.</p> \n<p>These companies are all based on the same basic idea: they sell mattresses made of foam that can be compressed enough to fit in a box the size of a dorm fridge. That lowers shipping costs and makes it easier to get the bed into tight spaces. Once removed from the box, the mattress expands to its full size.</p> \n<p><iframe frameborder=""0"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/b2UHgBTFAEc"" height=""480"" width=""853""></iframe></p> \n<p>You might think a mattress that expands from a box wouldn't be very comfortable, but reviews so far have been generally positive. These mattresses use materials similar to those found in high-end memory foam beds that can cost thousands of dollars through conventional retail channels.</p> \n<p>Casper and Leesa charge around $850 for a queen-size mattress. Tuft and Needle is even cheaper at $600. And because the companies sell their product directly to consumers via the web, there's no haggling.</p> \n<p>To entice customers to give the mattress a try, Casper and its rivals have introduced another innovation: a free, no-hassle return policy. All three companies let you try their mattresses for free for 100 days, and then return them if you're not satisfied.</p> \n<p>The big downside with these companies is a limited selection. Each company sells just one model (though it's available in a variety of sizes). All three companies have targeted the middle of the firmness scale. That means if you prefer a mattress that is particularly firm, or particularly soft, these products won't be a good option.</p> \n<p>Also, some people find conventional coil mattresses more comfortable than high-tech memory foam ones.

But before that, she was working in media, at the Washington Post and Huffington Post.</p> \n<p>Her column no doubt did well for the sheer shock value. (She recounts how she said nothing when an editor proposed firing someone ""before she 'got pregnant.'"") But another reason it resonates so strongly could be that the worst of Zaleski's actions line up with emerging research around the ways women — especially moms — are discriminated against in the workplace. Women have felt this for years. But the research, and now the confessions, are catching up.</p> \n<p>Zaleski recounts a few of her worst transgressions:</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>1. I secretly rolled my eyes at a mother who couldn’t make it to last minute drinks with me and my team. I questioned her ""commitment"" even though she arrived two hours earlier to work than me and my hungover colleagues the next day.</p> \n<p>2. I didn’t disagree when another female editor said we should hurry up and fire another woman before she ""got pregnant.""</p> \n<p>3. I sat in a job interview where a male boss grilled a mother of three and asked her, ""How in the world are you going to be able to commit to this job and all your kids at the same time?"" I didn’t give her any visual encouragement when the mother – who was a top cable news producer at the time – looked at him and said, ""Believe it or not, I like being away from my kids during the workday… just like you.""</p> \n<p>4. I scheduled last minute meetings at 4:30 pm all of the time. It didn’t dawn on me that parents might need to pick up their kids at daycare. I was obsessed with the idea of showing my commitment to the job by staying in the office ""late"" even though I wouldn’t start working until 10:30 am while parents would come in at 8:30 am.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>It's easy to see why the column went viral: it's not only enraging, but it's also a conversion story — once Zaleski had a baby herself, the scales fell from her eyes and she realized the error of her ways.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""center"">we're very good at honoring motherhood. but we seem to have trouble when moms need a paycheck or have career aspirations.</q></p> \n<p>She also gets into some of the very issues researchers have begun uncovering.</p> \n<p>For example, many working moms know that ""opting out"" isn't always opting out. Zaleski's story echoes an eye-opening <a href=""https://hbr.org/2014/12/rethink-what-you-know-about-high-achieving-women"">December study</a> of Harvard Business School alums. Many of those high-achieving women had stopped working, not because they wanted to be stay-at-home moms but because the working world had started to shun them.</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>[T]he vast majority leave reluctantly and as a last resort, because they find themselves in unfulfilling roles with dim prospects for advancement. The message that they are no longer considered ""players"" is communicated in various, sometimes subtle ways: They may have been stigmatized for taking advantage of flex options or reduced schedules, passed over for high-profile assignments, or removed from projects they once led.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Some women get subtle messages, as Harvard's researchers write...and as Zaleski shows, some women get interviewers asking them how they'll commit to a job and kids <em>at the same time</em>.</p> \n<p>A lack of flexibility for parents can also show up in women's paychecks. For example, Zaleski expected parents to conform to a non-parent schedule, coming to 4:30 pm meetings. That kind of rigidity can prevent women from keeping up with men. Harvard economist <a href=""http://scholar.harvard.edu/files/goldin/files/goldin_aeapress_2014_1.pdf"" target=""_blank"">Claudia Goldin</a> found in a 2014 study that flexibility in hours plays a huge part in creating more pay equality between men and women. As she wrote, ""The gender gap in pay would be considerably reduced and might vanish altogether if firms did not have an incentive to disproportionately reward individuals who labored long hours and worked particular hours.""</p> \n<p>It's true that Zaleski and Harvard Business School alums are breathing some rarefied air. But even the most basic kind of flexibility is unavailable to many American workers. According to <a href=""http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/docs/leave_report_final.pdf"" target=""_blank"">the White House</a>, only 39 percent of US workers report having access to paid family leave for the birth of a child. Even more shockingly, employers say only 11 percent of workers are covered, meaning some employers may be offering informal arrangements.</p> \n<p>It's true that not all bias in the workplace is as deliberate as that in Zaleski's former world — indeed, a lot of it may be subconscious. But it reflects a twisted attitude — that our society values motherhood but not the mothers themselves. In cards, poems, songs, movies, books, even commercials, we are very good at honoring mothers for being moms. What we seem to have trouble with is when those moms need to earn money or want to advance their careers.</p>",Business & Finance
How Google's wireless service could push down everyone's cellphone bill,http://www.vox.com/2015/3/9/8172063/google-republic-wireless-wifi,"Google's new service, which the Wall Street Journal says will launch within weeks, could reduce costs by relying more on cheap wifi connections.","<p>Google is getting into the wireless business, a company executive <a href=""http://www.wsj.com/articles/google-confirms-plan-to-offer-wireless-service-1425308552"">admitted</a> last week. That might mean cheaper wireless service for all of us.</p> \n<p>Google isn't building its own cellular towers — that would be way too expensive. Instead, Google will purchase capacity from other wireless carriers and resell it as a Google-branded service. The new service <a href=""http://www.wsj.com/articles/google-wireless-plan-has-one-catch-1425598890"">might launch</a> before the end of the month.</p> \n<p>By seamlessly combining expensive cellular service with cheap wifi, Google is expected to offer a service that's a lot cheaper than conventional wireless plans. Google wouldn't be the first to use this technique — it was pioneered by a startup called Republic Wireless — but a Google service would help to push the concept into the mainstream. And that will put pressure on wireless providers to cut their prices.</p> \n<h3>Google wants to put pressure on other wireless providers</h3> \n<p> </p> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3481736/167505727__1_.0.0.jpg"" alt=""167505727__1_.0.0.jpg"" data-chorus-asset-id=""3481736""></p> \n<p> </p> \n<p class=""caption"">Google, state, and city officials gathered at the Provo Convention Center to announce that the city has been chosen as the third city in the country to get Google Fiber on April 17, 2013. (George Frey/Getty Images)</p> \n<p> </p> \n<p>The wireless project bears some similarities to Google Fiber, the effort to build a super-fast fiber optic network in Kansas City — and later <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/1/28/7931959/google-fiber-cable-terrified"">other metropolitan areas</a>. When the Google Fiber project was launched about five years ago, it helped to highlight how far behind the curve incumbent phone and cable companies had fallen.</p> \n<p>When it launched, that network was 10 to 50 times faster than service available in other parts of the country. Building it pressured broadband providers across the country to upgrade their networks, which made Google products — especially the bandwidth-hungry YouTube — work better.</p> \n<p>Google may be trying to do something similar in the wireless market. The two biggest wireless providers, AT&amp;T and Verizon, have been charging high prices for plans that limit how much data users can download. If Google is able to offer a cheaper service, it would pressure conventional wireless providers to offer cheaper plans with fewer restrictions. That can only help Google's many online services. And it would be good for consumers, too.</p> \n<h3>Google doesn't have to win to win</h3> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3481732/489069331.0.jpg"" alt=""489069331.0.jpg"" data-chorus-asset-id=""3481732""></p> \n<p> </p> \n<p class=""caption"" style=""text-align: start;"">(hon ning tse / Getty)</p> \n<div><br></div> \n<p>Google's goal here probably isn't to dominate the wireless industry. That would be too expensive even for the deep-pocketed search giant. Building a wireless network from scratch requires constructing thousands of cellular towers and buying billions of dollars' worth of electromagnetic spectrum. These high costs are a big reason there are only four national wireless carriers: AT&amp;T, Verizon, Sprint, and T-Mobile.</p> \n<p>Instead, Google is planning to become a mobile virtual network operator (MVNO). That's a company that resells other companies' wireless service under its own brand. Examples of existing MVNOs include Boost Mobile, Cricket Wireless, and Virgin Mobile. From the customer's perspective, the distinction between MVNOs and conventional carriers doesn't matter very much. Many customers won't even realize that Google is reselling service from other companies.</p> \n<p>According to the Wall Street Journal, Google is <a href=""http://www.wsj.com/articles/google-to-sell-wireless-service-in-deals-with-sprint-t-mobile-1421887967"">planning to partner</a> with Sprint and T-Mobile, the two smallest of the nation's four wireless providers.</p> \n<h3>A wifi-first approach can save a ton of money</h3> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3481742/148172151.0.jpg"" alt=""148172151.0.jpg"" data-chorus-asset-id=""3481742""></p> \n<p> </p> \n<p class=""caption"">(John Moore/Getty Images)</p> \n<p> </p> \n<p>So why jump into the wireless business? It looks like Google's plan is to save money by helping people use cheap wifi networks more — and expensive cellular networks less.</p> \n<p>Wifi equipment is so cheap and user-friendly that anyone can set up a wifi network for their home or office. But most cellphones aren't set up to take full advantage of these potential savings. Switching from a wifi network to a cellular network in the middle of making a phone call or browsing the web causes dropped connections. As a result, our smartphones consume a lot of expensive cellular bandwidth when they could be using cheaper wifi service instead.</p> \n<p>In 2011, a startup called Republic Wireless <a href=""http://techcrunch.com/2011/11/07/republic-wireless-officially-unveils-19month-service-unlimited-everything-no-contracts/"">launched a new service</a> designed to use wifi networks more efficiently. Today, the company offers unlimited talk, text, and data for $40 per month using a high-speed 4G network. Or, if you can live with the slower speeds of older 3G networking technology, you can get unlimited talk, text, and data for $25 per month. That's two to four times less than the cost of a conventional wireless plan.</p> \n<p>Republic Wireless's service only works with Android-based Motorola phones that Republic has customized to support seamless switching between wifi and cellular networks. The Wall Street Journal <a href=""http://www.wsj.com/articles/google-wireless-plan-has-one-catch-1425598890"">reports</a> that Google's service will have a similar limitation: it will only work with the Nexus 6, a phone that's also made by Motorola.</p> \n<p>According to the Journal, Google ""expects to launch the service in coming weeks, but the start may be delayed.""</p> \n<p><b>Correction:</b> This article originally stated that Motorola was a Google subsidiary, but the unit was sold to Lenovo in late 2014.</p>",Business & Finance

"How a $10,000 Apple Watch could change how people see smartwatches",http://www.vox.com/2015/3/9/8177185/apple-iwatch-luxury-tesla,People think smartwatches are for nerds. Apple wants to change that.,"<p>The most striking thing about today's Apple event is the price of the luxury edition of the Apple Watch. While the low-end Apple Watch Sport starts at $349, the high-end version starts at an astronomical $10,000.</p> \n<p>Why did Apple do this? The obvious reason is: because it can. Presumably, the profit margin on a $10,000 watch — even an 18-karat-gold one — is huge. So if Apple thinks people will pay that much, why not do it?</p> \n<p>But making a super-expensive version of the Watch serves another purpose, too. Apple's big challenge is convincing people that a watch can be a status symbol rather than a funny-looking gadget you strap on your arm. To solve this problem, Apple is using a strategy that previously helped Tesla make electric cars cool.</p> \n<p>It's hard to remember today, but a decade ago electric cars didn't have a great reputation. Carmakers had experimented with a few electric vehicles, but these had not been a commercial success. The cars' primary selling point was their high fuel economy, but this wasn't very appealing when the cars themselves cost dramatically more than gasoline-powered alternatives.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""right""><span>Smartwatches have a reputation as impractical devices for nerds</span></q></p> \n<p>Tesla's solution to this problem was to focus on the very high end of the market. The first Tesla car, the Roadster, cost $109,000. And Tesla's marketing focused not on its energy efficiency but on the sports car's extremely fast acceleration, made possible by its powerful electric motor.</p> \n<p>This strategy of defying stereotypes about electric cars helped Tesla become one of the most prestigious brands in the auto industry. And as it has moved downmarket (the company introduced a $57,400 Model S in 2012 and is working on a vehicle that will cost $30,000), it has been buoyed by the luxury reputation the Roadster helped to establish.</p> \n<p>Apple faces a similar challenge with its Watch. Smartwatches have a reputation as impractical devices for nerds. Apple's strategy is to defy this stereotype by creating luxury smartwatches that (Apple hopes) people will pay $10,000 for.</p> \n<p>If this strategy works and Apple persuades people that its gold watches are in the same category as watches from Rolex and Cartier, it will create a halo effect that should boost the rest of Apple's product line. If rich and famous people are willing to shell out $10,000 for a gold Apple Watch, that will help persuade people that Apple Watches in general are cool.</p> \n<p>Of course, the reverse is also true. It's possible that those $10,000 watches will sit on the shelf unsold. If this happens despite Apple's legendary marketing savvy, it will confirm that smartwatches remain hopelessly uncool.</p> \n<p><b>Correction:</b> I originally described the Apple watch as gold plated, but the watches are solid gold.</p> \n<!-- CHORUS_VIDEO_EMBED ChorusVideo:66568 -->",Business & Finance

While battery technology does get better, the pace of progress is glacial compared with the speed of Moore's Law. The amount of power a given volume of battery can hold hasn't changed much over the past decade. So each time Apple has squeezed a few millimeters of thickness out of its laptops, it has been forced to devote a larger fraction of the internal space to the battery. This has progressed to the point where the latest MacBook is mostly battery inside.</p>",Business & Finance
The Apple Watch seems useless â€” just like the first PCs and smartphones,http://www.vox.com/2015/3/10/8182131/apple-watch-huge-deal,"People often underestimate new, smaller computing platforms.","<p>One of the first questions to come up in almost every discussion of the Apple Watch is: what is it good for?

By the standards of the day, these new computers were tiny, cheap, and ludicrously underpowered. They couldn't run the powerful business applications of the day's conventional computers, which were the size of a washing machine and cost tens of thousands of dollars. People who were used to these larger computers couldn't imagine what they'd do without it.</p> \n<p>The answer, it turned out, was run a new generation of applications that wouldn't have made sense on larger computers. People used PCs for word processing, spreadsheets, graphic design, computer games, and more.</p> \n<p>These are all applications that only make sense on computers small and cheap enough that there can be one on everyone's desk. It would have been absurd for a company executive to go down to the computer room and tie up a $100,000 mainframe typing a memo. It was a lot cheaper and more convenient to use a typewriter — or to dictate the memo and have a secretary type it up.

People mocked early BlackBerry users for trying to check their email on the go. But over time, people discovered that having a tiny, connected computer in their pocket is extremely useful.</p> \n<p>And once again, people invented new apps that wouldn't have made sense on a PC. Apps like Uber or Instagram only make sense in a device that's small enough to always be in your pocket.</p> \n<p>In both cases, what skeptics missed was that greater convenience (and lower cost) would lead people to use the new technology a lot more. If you've spent your life using film cameras — where developing a roll of film takes an hour and costs $5 — Instagram seems ridiculous.

It's true that any individual use for a smartwatch — say, reading a text message on your wrist rather than having to pull out your phone — is going to seem trivial.</p> \n<p>But the thing skeptics are missing is that smartwatches won't just allow people to do the things they already do more efficiently. It could cause people to do more and different things. Smartwatches eliminate the small but real time-cost of pulling your phone out of your pocket. So short interactions that would have seemed too trivial to be worth pulling your phone out of your pocket suddenly make sense.</p> \n<p>Of course, this is hard to imagine, just as it was hard for a PC user circa 1999 to imagine Instagram or Uber — or a mainframe user circa 1975 to imagine Excel or Photoshop.

For example, our watches might help us find items on our shopping list as we walk through the grocery store, alert us to historical markers as we pass them during vacations, or let us know when friends are nearby. These are all things we <em>could</em> do with our cellphones, but it's annoying to have our phones buzzing in our pockets all the time. Once our computers are on our wrists, they might seem a lot more compelling.</p> \n<p>But the really important apps are likely to be ones no one has thought of yet. Steve Jobs wasn't trying to revolutionize the taxi business when he created the iPhone, but Uber and Lyft wouldn't exist today without multi-touch smartphones. By the same token, there may be apps that only make sense once millions of people have computers on their wrists.

Video streaming app Meerkat seems ridiculous. But so did Twitter.,http://www.vox.com/2015/3/11/8191039/meerkat-explained,A new app that lets people live-stream video to their friends is blowing up on Twitter. Is it the next big thing?,"<p>There's a new social media fad that's going crazy on Twitter — people have started linking to a service called Meerkat. If you click these links fast enough, it will take you to a live video stream — probably of your friend doing something mundane like walking down the street or eating lunch.</p> \n<p>Meerkat has attracted tens of thousands of users in just a couple of weeks. And it seems silly. But most social media startups seemed silly when they were founded. Instagram seemed frivolous. Twitter seemed downright ludicrous.</p> \n<p>There have also been plenty of social startups that seemed silly and <em>were</em> silly — think of Yo or Ello. We don't know yet if Meerkat will be a big hit or a one-hit wonder.</p> \n<h3>Meerkat lets people broadcast live from their phones</h3> \n<p><span>To use Meerkat, you need two things: an iPhone and a Twitter account. You download the Meerkat app to your iPhone, enter your Twitter credentials, and can then start broadcasting live video with a few taps. (Right now, it's for iOS only, but an Android app is in the works.)</span></p> \n<p>Here's an example. I borrowed my colleague <a href=""https://twitter.com/laur_katz"" target=""_blank"">Lauren Katz</a>'s phone and gave a tour of the Vox office. We captured video of the stream — though normally you would only get to see it live. The quality of the video is terrible, but that's mostly my fault for waving the phone around too quickly.</p> \n<p><!-- CHORUS_VIDEO_EMBED ChorusVideo:66722 --></p> \n<p>Meerkat is best seen as a cousin of other services like Twitter, Instagram, and Vine that allow people to share nuggets of information with their friends and the world. Unlike other video-sharing platforms such as YouTube, however, Meerkat streams are ephemeral. Once the live stream is over, the video disappears from the site. It's something like Snapchat, except that you're sharing with anyone who wants to watch, not just your friends.</p> \n<h3>Meerkat is different from most other video streaming services</h3> \n<p>Meerkat puts a new spin on the old concept of a live-streaming video service.</p> \n<p>There are some well-known live-streaming video services out there, including UStream and Livestream. YouTube has a live video feature, too. But these services are geared toward large-scale, professional broadcasts such as corporate conferences or sporting events. Meerkat is simpler, cheaper, and better suited to amateurs.</p> \n<p>Perhaps the closest analogue here is Justin.tv, a 2007 startup whose founder, Justin Kan, live-streamed his life on his site continuously for several months to generate interest in the company. Justin.tv was not a big hit, but it evolved into into Twitch.tv, which allows people to live-stream video-game play. It was acquired by Amazon last year.</p> \n<p>Another live video–sharing app, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skype_Qik"">Qik</a>, was acquired by Skype in 2011 and has since shifted focus to sending private video messages.</p> \n<p>The main thing Meerkat adds is a social media dimension. Meerkat broadcasts are automatically announced on the user's Twitter account to attract viewers. And viewers must log into Twitter, as well, allowing broadcasters to know who is watching them.</p> \n<p>Ironically, <a href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/twitter-acquires-periscope-for-a-sizable-amount-2015-3"" target=""_blank"">Business Insider has reported</a> that Twitter recently acquired a company that was building a live-streaming app called Periscope that works a lot like Meerkat. That service hasn't launched yet.</p> \n<h3>Most Meerkat streams are pretty boring — to strangers at least</h3> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3493524/158871066.0.jpg"" alt=""158871066.0.jpg"" data-chorus-asset-id=""3493524""></p> \n<p> </p> \n<p class=""caption"">(Matt Cardy/Getty Images)</p> \n<p> </p> \n<p>If you look at random Meerkat streams (I did this by searching Twitter for the word ""meerkat""), most of the broadcasts are pretty boring. I found a woman streaming her drive from Oregon to Washington State, a couple of women walking down the street in San Francisco, a guy hanging out at a mall, and a group of people at some kind of meeting.</p> \n<p>However, looking at a random video isn't a good way to judge the service's utility. After all, if you looked at the average tweet or Instagram photo, it would look pretty boring, too. The point of Meerkat is to allow people to share snippets of their life with friends and family. And while watching snippets of a random person's daily life might be boring, getting a window into the life of your sister, best friend, or favorite celebrity might be more interesting.</p> \n<h3>Meerkat has only been around for a few weeks</h3> \n<p>Meerkat was created by a San Francisco–based startup that has undergone multiple rebrandings since its founding in 2012. The current incarnation has only been around since February.</p> \n<p>The company previously created two apps called Yevvo and Air, but neither gained traction with users. Then, <a href=""http://www.theverge.com/2015/3/9/8164893/meerkat-live-video-streaming-twitter-yevvo-periscope"">according to the Verge</a>, one of the company's investors suggested building a simplified video-sharing app that just did one thing well: live video streaming. The result, which the company originally saw as a side project, has proved so popular with users that the company is now making the app its primary focus.</p> \n<h3>Sometimes internet fads turn into serious companies</h3> \n<p>Over the years, quite a few apps have suddenly caught the public's imagination. Some of these, like Twitter and Instagram, went on to become huge, successful companies. Others, like <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/6/18/5820948/9-questions-about-yo-you-were-embarrassed-to-ask"">Yo</a> and <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/9/26/6844633/what-is-ello-should-i-care"">Ello</a>, quickly fizzled out after a brief flurry of interest.</p> \n<p>It's too soon to say which category Meerkat will be in, but there are some reasons for skepticism. For one thing, past efforts to build amateur live streaming apps have not been very successful. Justin Kam, the founder of Justin.tv, <a href=""http://www.theverge.com/2015/3/9/8164893/meerkat-live-video-streaming-twitter-yevvo-periscope"">says</a> he tried some of the same strategies Meerkat is pursuing before he finally gave up on live video streaming in favor of Twitch, the video-game streaming service he sold to Amazon.</p> \n<p>On the other hand, sometimes a startup will find a sweet spot that similar startups previously missed. YouTube was far from the first video-streaming website, but it launched at exactly the right time and with exactly the right features to become a huge hit. Perhaps Meerkat will be the startup that finally figures out how to make live, amateur video a viable business.</p>",Business & Finance

(They've also founded a new company called <a href=""http://carbon3d.com/"">Carbon3D</a> to sell the printer.)</p> \n<p>Unlike conventional 3D printing, which prints in layers, their printer continuously forms a new object. As a result, they say, it's much faster than conventional 3D printing, taking minutes instead of hours.</p> \n<p>This could finally bring the <a href=""https://hbr.org/2013/03/3-d-printing-will-change-the-world"">big advantage of 3D printing</a> — that it lets you easily customize or tweak designs by making changes to software, rather than building new manufacturing machines — to mass consumer products.</p> \n<h3>How ""continuous"" 3D printing actually works</h3> \n<p>There are a few different types of <a href=""http://mashable.com/2013/03/28/3d-printing-explained/"">existing 3D printers</a>, but they mostly work via the same principle: a printing head passes over a platform over and over, <a href=""http://mashable.com/2013/03/28/3d-printing-explained/"">depositing layer after layer</a> of a material like plastic<strong> </strong>in a precise pattern. Over time, these layers combine to form the desired object — much like a paper printer forms text on a page by putting down row after row of ink.</p> \n<p>By contrast, this new continuous 3D printer would do away with the layers entirely. Instead, a platform draws the object continuously out of a bath of liquid resin.</p> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3508660/3d_printing_gif.0.gif"" alt=""3d printing"" data-chorus-asset-id=""3508660""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">(<a href=""http://carbon3d.com/"" target=""_blank"">Carbon3D</a>)</p> \n<p>The resin solidifies when ultraviolet light hits it (a process called <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photopolymer"">photopolymerization</a>). So to create the desired item, a projector underneath the resin pool shoots UV light,  in the form of a series of cross-sectional images of the object. Light, in a sense, is the blade the printer uses to sculpt its products.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, oxygen prevents this reaction from occurring — so to stop the object from simply hardening and sticking to the floor of the pool, there's a layer of dissolved oxygen there, creating an ultra-thin ""dead zone"" at the very bottom.</p> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""3509822"" alt=""liquid printing diagram"" src=""https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3509822/How_CLIP_Works.0.png""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">(<a href=""http://carbon3d.com/"">Carbon3D</a>)</p> \n<p>With the projector and platform in sync, the object forms as it moves upward, with new resin continuously solidifying just above the dead zone.</p> \n<p>Right now, the printer is still a prototype, used by Carbon3D to print mainly demonstration objects. Carbon3D hasn't said how much it'll cost, but it does plan to begin selling the printers to companies in about a year.</p> \n<h3>Can continuous 3D printing really change the world?</h3> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""3510658"" alt=""3d printed heart stents"" src=""https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3510658/tumbleston6HR.0.jpg""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Prototype coronary stents, printed by Carbon3D's printer. (<a href=""http://carbon3d.com/"">Carbon3D</a>)</p> \n<p>3D printing in general is exciting for one big reason: it lets you customize objects or introduce new product designs simply by altering software (that is, the data the printer uses to make the object), rather than having to retrofit the molds or other hardware used to make the actual object.</p> \n<p>For this reason, lots of people have speculated that 3D printing could <a href=""https://hbr.org/2013/03/3-d-printing-will-change-the-world"">revolutionize manufacturing</a>, or lead to people printing their own goods at home instead of buying them at stores. But so far, it's mostly been a niche process, used for prototypes, models, and other individually crafted items.</p> \n<p>One of the reasons is that it's pretty slow. Conventional 3D printers usually take several hours to print an object — because with most printing methods, they need to individually treat each new layer of material after it's put down so that the next layer can be put down on top of it.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""right"">the new method works in minutes rather than hours</q></p> \n<p>The new method is much faster because it works continuously, instead of in layers, eliminating this step. As a result, it works in minutes rather than hours — 25 to 100 times faster, its creators say, than conventional 3D printing.</p> \n<p>The lack of layers also makes the products of this new method stronger. That's because they're solid objects, rather than layers of material stacked together.</p> \n<p>These two factors, Carbon3D says, could make its technology practical for mass-producing common products — like, say, a toothbrush you buy in a store. In theory, it could combine the flexibility of 3D printing with the speed and strength of old-school <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_moulding"">injection molding</a> — the current standard for mass-producing many types of products and parts, especially plastic ones.</p> \n<p>However, people have said similar things about conventional 3D printing, but that still hasn't happened. And that's not just because of time. Conventional 3D printing falls into a bit of a gap between potential uses — it's still far more expensive than manufacturing goods the old-fashioned way, but the printers are still mostly <a href=""http://www.zdnet.com/article/whats-holding-back-3d-printing-from-fulfilling-its-promise/"">too complex for the average person</a> to use at home.</p> \n<p>For it to succeed where conventional 3D printing hasn't, Carbon3D's technology will have to solve one of these problems. Its creators are betting it'll end up being cheap and reliable enough to use in mass production of goods, but right now, it's still a prototype — so we'll have to wait and see.</p>",Business & Finance
5 reasons self-driving taxis are going to be amazing,http://www.vox.com/2015/3/17/8231401/self-driving-taxis-amazing,"A sophisticated computer simulation predicts self-driving taxis will cost less than a third of conventional taxis, increase carpooling, and let millions of families get by without a car.","<p>In recent years, <a href=""http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/07/07/disruptions-how-driverless-cars-could-reshape-cities/"">lots</a> and <a href=""http://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2015/02/06/driverless-cars-google-uber-future-ford/22932537/"">lots</a> of pundits — <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/5/28/5758560/driverless-cars-will-mean-the-end-of-car-ownership"">including me</a> — have speculated about how self-driving cars will change American cities. But almost all the talk has been just that — speculation. Because we can't collect data on the social effects of a technology that isn't available yet.</p> \n<p>But a <a href=""http://www.ce.utexas.edu/prof/kockelman/public_html/TRB15SAVswithDRSinAustin.pdf"">recent study</a> does the next best thing: it starts with detailed data about today's traffic patterns, and then uses a computer simulation to predict what would happen if drivers switched to taking rides in self-driving taxis. The research, by University of Texas at Austin professor Kara Kockelman and the University of Utah's Daniel Fagnant, provides unprecedented insight into how self-driving vehicles will change the urban landscape.</p> \n<p>The researchers found that a company running a hypothetical fleet of self-driving taxis can make big profits charging $1 per mile, a fraction of what American taxis cost today. Each new self-driving taxi added to the fleet eliminates the need for about 10 privately owned cars. And thanks in part to the possibility of on-the-fly carpooling, the system can gracefully handle the demand spikes that occur during rush hour.</p> \n<p>Self-driving technology is going to dramatically change how people get to work, to school, and around town. It's going to make a car-free lifestyle a lot more attractive to a lot of people, make taxis affordable to a lot of people who can't afford them today, and help ease both traffic jams and parking shortages.</p> \n<h3>1) One self-driving taxi can replace around 10 private cars</h3> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""3512620"" alt=""112148752.0.jpg"" src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3512620/112148752.0.jpg""></p> \n<p> </p> \n<p class=""caption"">Car-sharing services like ZipCar are already reducing private car ownership. (Spencer Platt/Getty Images)</p> \n<p> </p> \n<p>Traffic planners collect detailed data about metropolitan traffic patterns to help them understand how changes to roads will affect traffic patterns. Kockelman and Fagnant realized they could use data from the Austin area (where UT is located) to build a precise simulation of how a self-driving taxi network would perform in the real world.</p> \n<p>They started with existing traffic patterns and then created a computer model in which a small fraction of car commuters (1.3 percent in their main simulation) ditched their cars and relied on self-driving taxis to get around instead. Fagnant wrote a computer program that simulated the movement of each self-driving vehicle over the course of a 24-hour day.</p> \n<p>In one 24-hour period, a fleet of 1,700 virtual self-driving vehicles completed 56,324 rides, which works out to a bit more than 30 rides per vehicle. Given that the typical privately owned car completes around three trips per day, this means each taxi does as much work as 10 private vehicles.</p> \n<p>This finding is consistent with the experience of car-sharing services like Zipcar. One study <a href=""http://www.uctc.net/access/38/access38_carsharing_ownership.pdf"">found</a> that each vehicle added to a car-sharing network corresponded to subscribers owning 9 to 13 fewer cars. This is a big social benefit, especially in cities that suffer from parking shortages.</p> \n<h3>2) Self-driving taxi rides are going to be really cheap</h3> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""3512724"" alt=""450502212__2_.0.jpg"" src=""https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3512724/450502212__2_.0.jpg""></p> \n<p> </p> \n<p class=""caption"">Self-driving taxis are going to be a lot cheaper than these guys. (Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)</p> \n<p> </p> \n<p>In the United States, the driver's labor is the single largest expense for today's taxi services. But self-driving taxis work 24 hours a day, seven days a week, for free. So taxi companies will be able to slash their fares.</p> \n<p>How much cheaper could taxi service get? Fagnant and Kockelman assume self-driving taxis will cost around $70,000 — less than they cost now but a plausible guess for what they'll cost a decade from now. They also assume their virtual taxi company will charge $1 per mile, which is less than a third of the $3.65 per mile that conventional taxis cost in Austin. Despite these low fares, their simulated taxi service is highly profitable, earning a 13.9 percent annual return on investment.</p> \n<p>There are several reasons to think fares will fall even lower than $1 per mile in the long run. Competition among self-driving taxi services should push prices — and therefore profits — down. Also, Fagnant and Kockelman assume self-driving taxis will have the same operating costs — about 50 cents per mile — as conventional vehicles. If self-driving taxis make super-efficient electric vehicles practical — as <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/5/28/5756736/the-case-for-self-driving-cars"">some people have predicted</a> — then savings on energy should translate into lower fares. It's also likely that progress in sensor technology will eventually bring the cost of self-driving taxis below $70,000.</p> \n<p>But even $1 per mile is cheap enough to make self-driving taxis a practical commuting option for many people, especially in urban areas. I live about two miles from Vox Media headquarters in downtown DC, so commuting by self-driving taxi would be a no-brainer for me — the $2 cab fare would be only slightly more than the $1.75 I currently pay to ride the bus to work, and it would be a lot more convenient.</p> \n<h3>3) Rush hour will work better than you think</h3> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""3512730"" alt=""493332185.0.jpg"" src=""https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3512730/493332185.0.jpg""></p> \n<p> </p> \n<p class=""caption"">(Scott Olson/Getty Images)</p> \n<p> </p> \n<p>When I <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/5/28/5758560/driverless-cars-will-mean-the-end-of-car-ownership"">wrote</a> a few months ago that self-driving taxis will mean the end of mass car ownership, the most common objection I heard regarded rush hour. Sure, people said, you can take taxis everywhere the rest of the time. But during the morning commute, everyone is going to work at the same time, so there's not much room for car-sharing.</p> \n<p>But the data tells a different story. Fagnant tells me a single self-driving taxi was able to complete several trips during each rush hour period.</p> \n<p>""You don't have a uniform peak where everybody leaves their house at 7:30 and arrives to work at 8,"" he says. ""You have some people who leave earlier, some who leave later, some who do reverse commuting.""</p> \n<p>According to Fagnant, an autonomous taxi might pick up someone in an outer-ring suburb and take him to his job in an inner-ring suburb. Then it could pick up someone in the inner-ring suburb and take her to her job downtown. It could then pick up someone who lives downtown and take him on a reverse commute out to the suburbs, before turning around to take another customer into downtown. It's true that some taxis will have to travel empty out to the suburbs to get the next passenger, which isn't efficient. But this doesn't have to happen as much as many people think.</p> \n<h3>4) Self-driving taxis can boost carpooling</h3> \n<div class=""align-right""> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""3512740"" alt=""84278414.0.jpg"" src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3512740/84278414.0.jpg""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">(Weimer Pursell / Galerie Bilderwelt/Getty Images)</p> \n</div> \n<p><span>The self-driving taxi network in the simulation was able to organize just-in-time carpooling arrangements, matching passengers who happened to be traveling in the same direction. This is similar to the </span><a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/8/7/5977685/lyfts-new-ridesharing-service-is-the-beginning-of-the-end-for-public"">UberPool and Lyft Line carpooling services</a><span> that exist today.</span></p> \n<p>Carpooling was still relatively rare, with about 4.5 percent of trips involving shared rides. However, this was still significant because it was concentrated during morning and evening rush hour, when cars and space on the roads were scarce.</p> \n<p>And surprisingly, passengers who agreed to the carpooling option didn't see their average trip time go up. Carpooling does slightly increase the average distance each passenger travels, since sometimes one passenger has to go out of his way so another can be dropped off. But this increased travel time was offset by the fact that carpooling reduced the amount of time people spent waiting for a taxi to arrive. This effect was most dramatic at rush hour, when carpooling slashed the average time passengers spent waiting for a car from nine minutes to four and a half minutes.</p> \n<h3>5) The economics of self-driving taxis get better as the network grows</h3> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3512750/462675492.0.jpg"" alt=""462675492.0.jpg"" data-chorus-asset-id=""3512750""></p> \n<p> </p> \n<p class=""caption"">(Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)</p> \n<p> </p> \n<p>Due largely to computational limitations, the study focused on scenarios in which only a small percentage of trips in the Austin area — about 1.3 percent — are taken in self-driving taxis. But Fagnant and Kockelman also did some simulations with higher (but still single-digit) market share for self-driving taxis, and found that the economics of self-driving taxis improve as the size of the network grows.</p> \n<p>If a network has more cars and passengers, it becomes easier for the system to find pairs of passengers who are a good fit for carpooling. The data reflects this. As the market share of self-driving taxis increased from 1.3 percent to about 6.5 percent, the fraction of carpooling trips rose from 4.5 percent to 5.9 percent.</p> \n<p>With more taxis on the road — including many taxis whose passengers are willing to carpool — the average wait time for a vehicle fell. The length of the average trip — including time spent waiting for the car to show up — declined by 30 seconds from 14 and a half minutes to 14 minutes.</p> \n<p>Finally, economies of scale should make self-driving taxi fleets more profitable as they get larger, as cars will spend less time waiting around (or driving back and forth) to get the next passenger. Assuming healthy competition, this should translate to even cheaper fares.</p> \n<h3>The simulation didn't capture every benefit of self-driving taxis</h3> \n<p>This research provides a lot of insight into how self-driving taxis will change the transportation market. However, some likely effects weren't captured by the simulation.</p> \n<p>One is changes in housing patterns. Self-driving taxis will make housing that's relatively close to downtown but not well-served by transit relatively more attractive. At the same time, because self-driving taxis won't need parking, cities will be able to devote more space to housing people and less to housing cars. It's hard to predict exactly how this will change cities, but it seems likely that the parts of the city that are made newly convenient will experience a building boom as nearly empty parking lots are converted to housing.</p> \n<p>Another important question not addressed in the research is how self-driving taxis will interact with transit. For example, self-driving taxis could allow increased use of the subway in the suburbs. Instead of driving to the subway station and paying several dollars to park in the park-and-ride (daily park-and-ride rates for subways in the Washington, DC, area, for example, average about $5), someone who lived two miles from the subway could take a taxi, paying $2 or or less each way. That could make subway stations practical in parts of the city that are currently too sparse to justify it.</p> \n<p>Of course, the model may not work for everyone. Fagnant's simulation focused on a 12-by-24-mile rectangle enclosing the densest parts of the Austin metro area, excluding trips that went into outlying areas. People in these areas have long commutes, which leaves fewer opportunities for vehicle sharing. For them, owning a car outright may make more sense for the foreseeable future.</p> \n<p>But there are millions of people who will find self-driving taxis to be a more convenient and affordable way to get to work than the alternatives.</p>",Business & Finance
The Federal Reserve hints interest rates could rise soon,http://www.vox.com/2015/3/18/8251825/fed-interest-rate-hike,"Interest rates have been at 0 percent since 2008, but that could change as soon as June.","<ul> \n<li><span>In a new statement, the Federal Reserve hints that it could start raising interest rates soon — perhaps as early as June.</span></li> \n<li>The stock market reacted positively to the news, rising about 1 percent in the hour after the release.</li> \n<li><span>The Fed is projecting that the unemployment rate will average between 5.0 and 5.2 percent in 2015. The current rate is 5.5 percent.</span></li> \n<li><span>The Fed is projecting low inflation over the next couple of years. It expects inflation to be below 0.8 percent in 2015 and below the Fed's 2 percent target in 2016.</span></li> \n</ul> \n<h3>Interest rates have been at zero for years</h3> \n<p>The traditional way the Fed has managed the economy is by manipulating short-term interest rates. Lower interest rates encourage borrowing and make it easier for businesses to invest and grow. But since the 2008 financial crisis, the Fed has been keeping short-term rates near zero.</p> \n<p>But with the economy recovering, the Fed is widely expected to raise interest rates for the first time in more than six years. The only question is when this will happen.</p> \n<p>In its January meeting, the Fed <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20150128a.htm"">signaled</a> that interest rate hikes were not imminent. ""The Committee judges that it can be patient in beginning to normalize the stance of monetary policy,"" the central bank said in its typical bureaucratic prose.</p> \n<p>In today's statement, the committee <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20150128a.htm"">said something more specific</a>: ""The Committee judges that an increase in the target range for the federal funds rate remains unlikely at the April FOMC meeting."" That stuff about being ""patient"" is gone. And the statement that the Fed won't raise rates in April sure sounds like a hint that it <i>will</i> raise them in the meeting after that — in June.</p> \n<p>But in a press conference following the statement's release, Fed Chair Janet Yellen encouraged people not to read too much into the change. ""Just because we removed the word 'patient' doesn't mean we're going to be impatient,"" she said.</p> \n<p>Another part of the latest Fed statement also suggests the Fed could wait longer. Today's statement says the Fed won't raise rates until it ""has seen further improvement in the labor market and is reasonably confident that inflation will move back to its 2 percent objective over the medium term.""</p> \n<p>The stock market has reacted positively to the news, with the S&amp;P 500 up about 1 percent for the day. Ordinarily, news that interest rate hikes are coming would trigger a fall in stock prices. The fact that markets rose instead may reflect relief that the Fed didn't send a stronger signal that higher rates were coming.</p>",Business & Finance
Can every company really act like a startup?,http://www.vox.com/2015/3/19/8252787/eric-ries-lean-startup,Eric Ries believes almost any company can innovate more if it uses strategies pioneered in Silicon Valley.,"<p>It's become a cliché for an executive at a large company to promise to run it like a startup. Yet in his influential 2011 book <em>The Lean Startup</em>, startup founder and business guru Eric Ries argued that businesses of any size and age — and perhaps even nonprofit organizations and governments — can still learn a lot from management methods pioneered in Silicon Valley.</p> \n<p>On Monday, Ries began work on his next book project. Fittingly, he started it off with a <a href=""https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/881308232/only-on-kickstarter-the-leaders-guide-by-eric-ries/posts"">Kickstarter campaign</a>. The campaign achieved its $135,000 fundraising goal on Tuesday, and by Thursday morning Ries had more than $170,000 in pledges.</p> \n<p>""I'm a believer that this is the future of publishing,"" Ries told me on Monday shortly after the campaign began. For Ries, the Kickstarter campaign isn't just about raising money; it's also a way to solicit feedback from his future readers. <span>Pledgers will be able to participate in a closed online community for aspiring entrepreneurs.</span><span> Ries wants to learn what they want from the book and — more important — gather examples of real-world business successes and failures that he can incorporate into the book.</span></p> \n<p>Ries' big idea is that the key to success for a startup — or any organization trying to innovate — is to learn quickly and act on the knowledge gained. While that might sound obvious, doing it often requires people to do many things that are counterintuitive.</p> \n<h3>Why startups need a different way to measure productivity</h3> \n<p>Normal companies — and normal employees — measure their productivity by how many units of output they produce each day. A chef might measure his productivity by the number of meals he prepares, while a programmer might measure the number of lines of code she's written.</p> \n<p>This notion of productivity assumes whatever is produced can be sold at a profit. This is a reasonable assumption for an established business in a mature industry.</p> \n<p>But by definition, startups are trying to pioneer new product categories in situations of extreme uncertainty. There's a big risk that once the product is done, no one will buy it. And in that case, it doesn't matter how ""productive"" the company was in the months before the product was released, because no one is going to benefit from all that hard work.</p> \n<h3>A minimum viable product gets customer feedback as fast as possible</h3> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3517836/96796887.0.jpg"" alt=""96796887.0.jpg"" data-chorus-asset-id=""3517836""></p> \n<p> </p> \n<p class=""caption"">Zappos CEO Tony Hsieh in 2010. (Ethan Miller/Getty Images)</p> \n<p> </p> \n<p>Ries argues that startups should think about productivity differently: as the ability to quickly receive and respond to feedback from customers. Good startups boost productivity by minimizing the amount of time they waste building products customers won't want.</p> \n<p>A key strategy here is to create a ""minimum viable product."" An MVP is a real product, not just a prototype. But the goal is to get the product out the door as quickly as possible, even if it's still missing key features and may only appeal to a narrow subset of the target audience.</p> \n<p>Sometimes an MVP can be amazingly bare-bones. For example, the popular online shoe retailer Zappos started out by just walking into retail stores, taking pictures of shoes, and then listing those shoes for sale on their website. If a customer ordered a pair, they'd go back to the same store, buy them at full price, and ship them to the customer.</p> \n<p>Obviously, this wasn't a viable long-term business model. But starting this way allowed Zappos to learn a lot about the market before spending a single dollar on inventory or warehouses. It avoided the risk of wasting millions of dollars building infrastructure for an online store customers wouldn't use.</p> \n<p>This approach seems counterintuitive to many people, who worry that a low-quality MVP might turn off customers and tarnish a company's brand. But having customers who are frustrated with your product's limitations is a lot better than not having customers at all. And if you're building a new type of product, having no customers is a real risk.</p> \n<h3>Why specialized teams kill innovation</h3> \n<p>Many companies are organized by function. A company might have a sales department, an engineering department, a design department, and so forth. While this method of organization has intuitive appeal, Ries argues that it's deadly for innovation.</p> \n<p><q class=""right"" aria-hidden=""true""><span>Having customers who are frustrated with your product's limitations is a lot better than not having customers at all</span></q></p> \n<p>Remember, the key to innovation is to learn what customers want as quickly as possible, and then to act on that knowledge. At any given point in time, different companies will have different ideas about how to make the product better. For example, the sales team's frequent contact with customers might give them insight into what features customers would like, while only people on the engineering team know which feature ideas are technically feasible.</p> \n<p>If these two groups are segregated into different departments, learning will happen slowly. The engineering department will spend hundreds of hours building a new feature before the sales team tells them it's not what customers were asking for. The sales team might spend weeks touting a new feature to customers before learning the engineering team can't actually deliver it.</p> \n<p>Ries notes that this idea — that cross-functional teams are more efficient than specialized ones — flies in the face of most peoples' intuition. When people are thrown into teams containing a mix of different job skills, they often feel they're being less productive, because they're forced to spend a lot more time talking to people with different job skills.</p> \n<p>Individual workers might feel these interruptions reduce productivity. But these conversations tend to increase the productivity of the organization as a whole. That's because one part of the company is less likely to waste time working on things that don't actually serve the needs of other parts — or, ultimately, of customers. The programmer will overhear the sales guy in the next cubicle promising a customer features that are impossible. The sales guy will be able to give the programmer earlier feedback about what customers are looking for.</p> \n<h3>Can every company really act like a startup?</h3> \n<p><q class=""right"" aria-hidden=""true""><span>A large company wanting to follow these strategies faces an uphill climb</span></q></p> \n<p>One of the big themes of <em>The Lean Startup</em> is that any company — large or small, old or new — can innovate like a startup. In theory, the strategies he advises — including building minimal viable products and organizing around small, cross-functional teams — can be practiced by a company of any size.</p> \n<p>Still, a large company wanting to follow these strategies faces an uphill climb. Organizing a company by function is such an intuitive idea that most wind up doing it. The larger and older a company is, the harder it will be to change how business is done.</p> \n<p>And while an MVP is a great way for a startup to test out a new product, the potential pitfalls are bigger for established companies. Customers expect a new product from a well-known brand to meet a certain quality threshold, and when a product fails to deliver, they judge it harshly. Big companies are naturally cautious because they have a lot to lose.</p> \n<p>Ries isn't blind to these challenges, of course. In his first book, he offers some advice on how to deal with them. The goal of his new book project — which aims to produce one book designed for his Kickstarter supporters and then a second book for a broader audience — is to develop more practical advice for<strong> </strong>putting the principles of his first book into action<strong> </strong>in a variety of settings.</p> \n<p>And he's hoping to have a lot of help to do that. Over the next year, he'll be encouraging members of his online community to put his ideas into practice and report back on the results. Hopefully, he'll learn a lot, and then share that with the rest of us.</p>",Business & Finance
This Target executive knows what's wrong with the minimum wage,http://www.vox.com/2015/3/19/8259865/target-minimum-wage,"There's a simple way to determine a good minimum wage in your city, and it has nothing to do with ballot initiatives.","<p>Target is joining the long line of retailers that are upping their wages, with reports that the store will soon be setting its minimum pay at $9 per hour. The Gap raised its wages early last year, and <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/2/19/8068871/walmart-minimum-wage-pay"">Walmart</a> and <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/2/26/8107517/walmart-tj-maxx-raises"">T.J. Maxx</a> have followed suit this year.</p> \n<p>The nationwide wage hike seems to represent a change in Target's thinking. Earlier this month, the company's CFO, John Mulligan, <a href=""http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/03/18/target-wages-idUSL2N0WK2T120150318"">said</a> it was ""not reasonable"" for the store to think about its wages in terms of one national hourly rate, as Reuters reported.</p> \n<p>""Fixating on some single number to us, on an average number is unimportant. It’s about being competitive locally at a store level within a marketplace,"" he said. He also noted that Target <a href=""http://www.wsj.com/articles/target-to-increase-wages-to-minimum-9-hour-for-all-workers-in-april-1426709296"">already paid more than $9 per hour</a> in places where wages were high, like New York and North Dakota.</p> \n<p>So why is Target changing its tune? The decisions of Walmart and T.J. Maxx to set their own national minimums may have forced the company's hand.</p> \n<p>But Mulligan's broader point was absolutely right, and it applies not only to Target but also to how we think about minimum wage laws nationwide. It doesn't make sense to set a uniform minimum wage across the country, and then hope state and local governments raise them as needed. It would make more sense to have a federal system in which the local minimum wage in each area is more connected to local economic conditions.</p> \n<h3>A one-size-fits-all wage doesn't work</h3> \n<p>If you've ever moved from one major city to another for a new job, you've probably experienced how different the cost of living can be in different places. The $50,000 you were making in Memphis might sound small compared with your new $70,000 salary in New York ... until you see rents in the Big Apple.</p> \n<p>The same principle applies at the bottom of the wage scale: earning $7.25 per hour is a lot more doable in rural Idaho, for example, than in a higher-cost place like Dallas, Texas, where the minimum wage is also at the federal minimum.</p> \n<p>It's true that many places have independently raised their own wages. San Francisco, which famously has a high cost of living, is slowly ratcheting its minimum wage up to $15 per hour. Indeed, at a time when many people agree the federal minimum is too low ($7.25 per hour, or around $15,100 annually for a full-time worker), <a href=""http://www.ncsl.org/research/labor-and-employment/state-minimum-wage-chart.aspx"">29 states and the District of Columbia</a> have minimum wages above the federal minimum. And as <a href=""http://livingwage.mit.edu/"">MIT's Living Wage Project</a> has found, the federal minimum wage simply isn't enough to live on for most American families.</p> \n<p>But just hoping cities and states raise their minimums on their own isn't a great policy. Minimum-wage laws can get tied up in prolonged political fights in state legislatures, meaning minimum wages end up reflecting state and local politics, not state and local economies, as<span> </span><span>University of Massachusetts-Amherst economist Arindrajit Dube</span><span> wrote in a</span><a href=""http://www.hamiltonproject.org/files/downloads_and_links/state_local_minimum_wage_policy_dube.pdf"" target=""_blank""> 2014 paper</a><span>.</span></p> \n<p>As economist <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/28/upshot/a-minimum-wage-that-makes-more-sense.html?abt=0002&amp;abg=1"">Jared Bernstein wrote</a> last year, Dube's way is a better way: Dube proposed that state and local minimum wages be based at half the local median wage, a level he says is consistent with the US minimum wages of the 1960s and 1970s, as well as with standards in advanced economies.</p> \n<p>He also advocates that lawmakers take local costs of living into account when setting those minimum wages, as the median wage and cost of living aren't perfectly correlated around the country. And finally, he advocates indexing wages to inflation, thus taking care of the problem of having to revisit the issue constantly.</p> \n<h3>What's needed: both higher and more location-specific wages</h3> \n<p>Using Dube's calculations, every state would have a minimum wage above the current federal level of $7.25 per hour.</p> \n<p>Mississippi is the state that would have the lowest minimum wage — $7.97 per hour — under Dube's proposal. Adjust for regional prices, and it's even higher, at $8.42.</p> \n<p>Businesses and the government, of course, have different rationales for setting their minimum wages: firms want to attract talent, while the government wants to make sure people are making enough to live on. But to achieve either requires some semblance of flexibility, and the federal government's nationwide, rarely changing minimum wage simply doesn't have that.</p>",Business & Finance
Why Uber's deal with big insurance companies matters,http://www.vox.com/2015/3/24/8285963/why-ubers-deal-with-big-insurance-companies-matters,A new deal between Uber and several major insurance companies could help close a gap in coverage that can hurt drivers.,"<ul> \n<li>Uber says it has struck a deal with several major insurance companies to overhaul how personal insurance policies cover Uber drivers who get in accidents.</li> \n<li>The deal is supported by State Farm, Farmers, and USAA, as well as the American Insurance Association, according to a <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://blog.uber.com/insurancealigned"">post on Uber's blog</a>.</li> \n<li>Supporters hope the deal will become the basis of legislation in a number of states in the coming months. It is designed to prevent drivers from falling into a gap between insurance coverage offered by ride-sharing companies and a driver's personal insurance policy.</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>Right now, ride-sharing drivers can fall into a legal twilight zone</h3> \n<p>After I <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/12/17/7402311/lyft-driver-pay"">wrote about my week as a Lyft driver</a> back in December, the most common feedback I got was that I should have written about Lyft's (and Uber's) problems with insurance. Traditionally, the car insurance market has been divided between commercial insurance policies for people who use their cars to earn a living, like taxi and limousine drivers, and personal insurance for everyone else. But ride-sharing drivers too often fall into a legal gray area: their personal insurance won't cover accidents that happen while drivers are on the clock, but full commercial insurance was too expensive for part-time drivers to afford.</p> \n<p>Uber and Lyft have stepped in with their own insurance policies that cover drivers most of the time they're working for the ride-sharing companies. However, there have still been <a href=""http://qz.com/365854/a-coverage-dispute-between-uber-lyft-and-insurers-leaves-drivers-exposed/"">gaps in coverage</a> that can leave drivers exposed. Drivers have sometimes been caught in the middle of disputes between Uber and insurance companies about who should cover which accidents.</p> \n<p>The new framework is designed to eliminate these gaps by establishing a clear set of rules for which accidents can be covered by personal insurance policies and which ones must be covered by either Uber or drivers.</p> \n<p>The framework may also provide a boost for a new breed of supplemental policies being offered by a growing number of insurance companies. In January, both <a href=""http://www.carriermanagement.com/news/2015/01/08/133917.htm"">USAA</a> and <a href=""http://www.carriermanagement.com/news/2015/01/15/134182.htm"">Farmers Insurance</a> announced a limited ride-sharing plan that covers a driver between the time ""driver mode"" is enabled and the time the driver accepts a hail (at which point full coverage from Uber or Lyft kick in). GEICO <a href=""http://www.insurancejournal.com/news/east/2015/02/04/356433.htm"">began offering</a> a ride-sharing plan in Maryland last month. The cost of the coverage is fairly modest — USAA plans to charge just $6 to $8 per month. The Farmers ride-sharing option is expected to boost drivers' premiums by about 25 percent.</p> \n<p><b>Update: </b>I've updated this post to reflect <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://blog.uber.com/insurancealigned"">Uber's confirmation</a> of the deal <a href=""http://www.insurancejournal.com/blogs/right-street/2015/03/24/361971.htm"" target=""_blank"">first reported in Insurance Journal</a>.</p>",Business & Finance
"Silicon Valley is becoming a little more like Wall Street, and that's a good thing",http://www.vox.com/2015/3/25/8287989/porat-google-acquisitions-innovation,"Big tech companies often innovate via acquisitions, and Wall Street bankers help these deals work smoothly.","<p>Google has hired Morgan Stanley CFO Ruth Porat to be its new CFO. Neil Irwin notes that this is part of a <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/25/upshot/why-wall-streeters-defecting-to-silicon-valley-is-good-news-for-the-economy.html?smid=tw-nytimes&amp;abt=0002&amp;abg=0"">broader trend</a> of talent shifting from Wall Street to Silicon Valley.</p> \n<p>In Irwin's view, this is a positive trend. Obviously, Wall Street performs an important function in channeling investments to companies that need them. But Irwin argues this is still a ""back-office function,"" like legal services or human resources, that doesn't directly create wealth for consumers. On this view, an overgrown finance sector acts as a drag on the economy, so talent shifting to Silicon Valley is a positive sign.</p> \n<p>A contrary view, <a href=""http://qz.com/369233/wall-streets-infiltration-of-silicon-valley-is-a-bad-sign-for-the-us-economy/"">expressed by Tim Fernholz</a>, is that big Silicon Valley firms are simply becoming more like big Wall Street firms. Fernholz suggests that instead of creating innovative new products and services themselves, technology firms are increasingly acquiring technology companies that would have succeeded anyway and then claiming credit — and a bunch of profits — when they do.</p> \n<p>There's some merit in both perspectives. But I think it's a mistake to draw a sharp distinction between innovation on the one hand and Wall Street–style financial engineering on the other. It's absolutely true that a lot of what Wall Street does — like, say, buying a company, <a href=""http://www.dmagazine.com/publications/d-ceo/2012/november/why-private-equity-creates-more-debt-than-jobs"">loading it up with debt</a>, and then reselling it — doesn't create value for society.</p> \n<p>But most high-tech dealmaking isn't like that. There are a lot of ambitious startups in Silicon Valley that have a kernel of a good idea but lack the resources — both financial and otherwise — to turn that idea into a successful product. Like Wall Street banks, big Silicon Valley companies bring cash to the table. But unlike banks or conglomerates, technology giants also bring other things, like technical infrastructure, ownership of complementary products, and a brand that helps push little-known technologies into the mainstream.</p> \n<h3>Android and Siri prove the value of smart dealmaking</h3> \n<p>Two examples help make the point. One is Android, which Google acquired in 2005. You could say Google ""merely"" bought Android and then managed it well as it grew into the world's most popular mobile OS. Yet it's hard to imagine almost any other company doing this so successfully. Google brought a lot to the table, from apps like Google Maps and Chrome to a corporate culture and reputation for innovation that made it easy to hire and retain the best programmers.</p> \n<p>The same point applies to Siri. It was an innovative technology before Apple acquired it in 2010, but it wasn't obvious how it could succeed as a stand-alone product. Making Siri part of iOS not only put it in the hands of a lot more customers, but also made it a lot more useful, since it could be deeply integrated with other features of Apple's mobile OS.</p> \n<h3>Bankers can play a valuable role</h3> \n<p>Of course, a finance person like Porat isn't the most important ingredient in this kind of deal: the key decisions — which companies to buy and what do with them — need to be made by people with more technical expertise. I'd be worried if Silicon Valley companies started to hire Wall Street bankers to be their CEOs.</p> \n<p>But people like Porat can expand a company's capacity to make deals like this.

Kraft and Heinz are merging to form a food superconglomerate,http://www.vox.com/2015/3/25/8288047/kraft-heinz-merger,Warren Buffett and the Brazilian private equity group 3G are putting up the money to make the deal happen.,"<p> </p> \n<ol> \n<li> <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/hj-heinz-company-and-kraft-foods-group-sign-definitive-merger-agreement-to-form-the-kraft-heinz-company-300055709.html"">Heinz and Kraft today announced plans to merge</a>, forming the fifth-largest food company in the world.</li> \n<li><span>Before the merger, Heinz was jointly owned by Warren Buffett's Berkshire-Hathaway and a Brazilian private equity group called 3G.</span></li> \n<li><span>Former Kraft shareholders will own 49 percent of the new company, with Berkshire and 3G splitting the rest.</span></li> \n<li><span>Heinz's current CEO, Bernardo Hees — who is also a partner at 3G — will run the newly unified company.</span></li> \n<li><span>Kraft shareholders will also get a $10 billion special dividend, financed by Berkshire and 3G, to grease the wheels of the deal.</span></li> \n</ol> \n<h3>What brands will the new entity combine?</h3> \n<p>Kraft is probably best known for its mac and cheese and Heinz is definitely best known for its ketchup, but both companies are portfolios of brands. The companies released a handy infographic to summarize everything the new company controls:</p> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3538900/0001ur-1.0.png"" alt=""0001ur-1.0.png"" data-chorus-asset-id=""3538900""></p> \n<h3>This is probably bad news for Kraft employees</h3> \n<p>While Warren Buffett has traditionally taken a ""buy and don't change much"" approach to acquisitions, the hallmark of 3G's management of Heinz has been firing lots of workers. There were the <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://triblive.com/business/headlines/4524974-74/heinz-pittsburgh-company#axzz3VPBcZNMd"">August 2013 layoffs</a>, the <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.bizjournals.com/pittsburgh/blog/morning-edition/2014/04/heinz-offers-buyouts-to-pittsburgh-based-employees.html"">April 2014 buyouts</a>, the <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.post-gazette.com/business/news-briefs/2014/11/22/Heinz-announces-layoffs/stories/201411220038"">November 2014 layoffs</a>, etc.</p> \n<p>One suspects part of the value Buffett bought to the table in the Heinz purchase is that his folksy persona helped obscure the extent to which foreign investors were taking over an iconic American brand to sack its employees. Finding redundant back-office staff to lay off is generally a priority in any merger, and putting the Heinz management team in charge is a good sign that there is ruthlessness to come.</p> \n<h3>Kraft will try to go global</h3> \n<p>The more optimistic take on the merger is that this combines Kraft's products with Heinz's platforms. The background here is that the current version of Kraft is the result of a corporate split, in which a giant food conglomerate became two companies. One of those companies, Mondolez, controls an <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.mondelezinternational.com/brand-family"">international portfolio of snack brands</a>. New Kraft, by contrast, is very focused on supermarket products targeting the US market — Velveeta, Jell-O, Oscar Mayer, etc.</p> \n<p>Heinz has a narrow range of products, but it is very global. The new company says it wants to fuel ""global expansion"" by ""combining Kraft's brands with Heinz's international platform."" In other words, they think they can use Heinz's distribution network to place Kraft products in foreign supermarkets, where its various wares may have more growth potential than in the mature American market.</p>",Business & Finance
What Steve Wozniak is missing about our future robot overlords,http://www.vox.com/2015/3/25/8288309/steve-wozniak-robot-overlords,Apple cofounder Steve Wozniak is worried that smart computers will take over the world. But being smarter doesn't necessarily help people â€” or machines â€” gain power.,"<p>Apple cofounder Steve Wozniak is the latest technology luminary to <a href=""http://www.afr.com/technology/apple-cofounder-steve-wozniak-on-the-apple-watch-electric-cars-and-the-surpassing-of-humanity-20150323-1m3xxk"">predict</a> that computers will eventually take over the world and relegate humanity to a subservient role.</p> \n<p>""Like people including Stephen Hawking and Elon Musk have predicted, I agree that the future is scary and very bad for people,"" Wozniak said in an interview with Australian Financial Review. ""If we build these devices to take care of everything for us, eventually they'll think faster than us and they'll get rid of the slow humans to run companies more efficiently.""</p> \n<p>This argument is superficially plausible: humans are the smartest species on earth, and we also dominate all other species. So if you built machines that are smarter than humans, they'd be able to dominate us just as easily.</p> \n<p>But if you think about who has power <em>within</em> human societies, the theory that intelligence leads to power seems more dubious.</p> \n<p>If this theory were true, societies would be run by their scientists, philosophers, or chess prodigies. Instead, America — like most societies around the world — has been run by men like Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton, and George W. Bush. These men became powerful not because they were unusually bright, but because they were well-connected, charismatic, and knew how to offer the right combination of carrots and sticks to get others to do their bidding.</p> \n<p>It's true that brilliant scientists have played an important role in creating powerful technologies such as the atomic bomb. And it's conceivable that a super-intelligent computer would conceive of similar breakthroughs. But building new technologies and putting them into practice usually requires a lot of cash and manpower, which only powerful institutions like governments and large corporations can muster. The scientists who designed the atomic bomb needed Franklin Roosevelt to fund it.</p> \n<p>The same point applies to intelligent computers. Any plausible plan for taking over the world would require the cooperation of thousands of people. There's no reason to think a computer would be any more effective at enlisting their assistance for an evil plot than a human scientist would be. Indeed, given that persuasion often depends on longstanding friendships, in-group loyalties, and charisma, a disembodied, friendless computer program would be at a huge disadvantage.</p> \n<p><b>Correction:</b> In the caption I misidentified Steve Wozniak as Apple's CEO rather than its cofounder.</p>",Business & Finance
"Relax, the rumored Facebook-NYT deal is probably good for readers and journalism",http://www.vox.com/2015/3/25/8290161/facebook-nyt-news-deal,Some journalists are worried about a deal to put New York Times content on Facebook. They shouldn't be.,"<p>If a <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2015/05/new-york-timesfacebook-deal-is-here.html"">report by Gabriel Sherman</a> of New York Magazine is accurate, the New York Times is about to sign a historic deal with Facebook that would allow Times news stories to be hosted directly on Facebook's website. The deal — and similar deals with other websites — could benefit users by sharply reducing the time it takes to load news stories. <span>A lot of pundits see this as a danger to the independence of news organizations.</span></p> \n<p>Felix Salmon, for example, <a href=""http://fusion.net/story/108799/how-facebook-could-kill-the-news-brand/"">has warned</a> that hosting content on Facebook could dilute the brands — and ultimately undermine the journalistic standards — of prestigious media organizations like the New York Times.</p> \n<p>""If Facebook continues to grow as a trusted news source in its own right,"" Salmon argues, ""then the result could be an existential crisis for news organizations with old-fashioned things like editors and fact-checkers and clear ethical guidelines.""</p> \n<p>But this misunderstands something important about the media business. News organizations have always done two things: decide what content people should read, and produce the content itself. We're not used to thinking about these as separate functions because in traditional news organizations — especially newspapers and magazines — they were always packaged together.</p> \n<p>But the internet is pulling them apart. And once you start to think about these as distinct functions, the apparent dangers of Facebook-hosted content no longer seem so threatening.</p> \n<h3>News organizations have already lost control of their readers</h3> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""3540102"" alt=""2054107736_e231ed3572_o.0.jpg"" src=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3540102/2054107736_e231ed3572_o.0.jpg""></p> \n<p> </p> \n<p class=""caption"">Internet news doesn't work like this.

Blume</a>)</p> \n<p> </p> \n<p>We can think of the New York Times website as really being two products. The homepage is a news aggregator that performs the same function as sites like Digg, Reddit, and Facebook: it suggests articles people might want to read.</p> \n<p>Then there's the New York Times's core business: producing news articles. The success of these articles doesn't depend much on how users find them. A click from Facebook is worth about as much as a click from Twitter, Reddit, or the New York Times homepage.</p> \n<p>Media organizations tend to overrate the importance of that first part of their businesses. This is especially true of newspaper editors, who have always viewed deciding what goes on A1 as a core part of their job. But the reality is that news organization homepages have been getting less and less important. Today users mostly find news with the help of news aggregators or social media sites, not by bookmarking a news organization's homepage.</p> \n<p>So the trend Salmon is worried about — in which news organizations lose control over how readers find and consume their stories — has been underway for years. News organizations, even really big ones like the New York Times, already depend on third-party platforms for most of their traffic.</p> \n<p>Indeed, I suspect most users will barely notice the shift from reading NYT-hosted content via Facebook links to reading NYT content hosted by Facebook. Users don't care which company owns the server that provided a particular bit of content or which ad network provided the ad that appears next to it. The only change most Facebook users are likely to notice is that New York Times articles load faster than they used to.</p> \n<h3>News brands will still matter</h3> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""3540098"" alt=""139519718.0.jpg"" src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3540098/139519718.0.jpg""></p> \n<p> </p> \n<p class=""caption"">(Ethan Miller/Getty Images)</p> \n<p> </p> \n<p>Of course, it's important for the terms of an agreement like this to be right. News organizations need to have final control over the content of articles, and they need to get enough revenue for the shift to Facebook to make financial sense. But given the significant consumer benefits of faster and more streamlined browsing, it should be possible to come up with terms that are good for Facebook, news organizations, and the reading public.</p> \n<p>Salmon worries that as news organizations lose control over how their content is consumed, their brands will be devalued in the process. But recent experience points in the opposite direction: the strength of the Times brand means people are more likely to read, share, and link to Times articles over articles published by other news organizations.</p> \n<p>And letting Facebook host news articles won't make Facebook a ""trusted news source in its own right"" any more than journalists tweeting makes Twitter a trusted news source. Users understand the difference between technology platforms (like Facebook, Twitter, and Reddit) and news organizations (like the New York Times, the Washington Post, and CNN).</p> \n<p>This is more obvious in broadcast media than in print. People can get CNN content lots of different ways — cable networks, satellite TV services, or CNN's own website. But partnerships with cable and satellite companies aren't harming CNN's brand, because everyone understands that a cable channel is a different thing from a video distribution system. By the same token, the fact that people can get New York Times articles on Facebook's website isn't going to fool anyone into thinking Facebook has become a news organization.</p> \n<p><b>Disclosure:</b> Vox Media, the parent company of Vox.com, is involved in a <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://blog.voxmedia.com/post/117166810442/vox-media-joins-facebooks-anthology-to-partner-on"">collaboration with Facebook</a> to develop video content.</p>",Business & Finance
Here's how incredible computer word processing seemed in 1982,http://www.vox.com/2015/3/26/8295171/james-fallows-word-processing-1982,"Atlantic writer James Fallows spent $4,000 on a computer that could only handle a few thousand words of text at a time. And he thought it was amazing.","<p>Today, everyone takes it for granted that you can type text into a computer and edit it on the screen. But this wasn't always such a commonplace activity. Indeed, it used to seem downright miraculous, as this 1982 <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.theatlantic.com/past/issues/82jul/fallows.htm"">passage by James Fallows</a> in the Atlantic shows:</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p><span>When I sit down to write a letter or start the first draft of an article, I simply type on the keyboard and the words appear on the screen. For six months, I found it awkward to compose first drafts on the computer. Now I can hardly do it any other way. It is faster to type this way than with a normal typewriter, because you don't need to stop at the end of the line for a carriage return (the computer automatically ""wraps"" the words onto the next line when you reach the right-hand margin), and you never come to the end of the page, because the material on the screen keeps sliding up to make room for each new line. It is also more satisfying to the soul, because each maimed and misconceived passage can be made to vanish instantly, by the word or by the paragraph, leaving a pristine green field on which to make the next attempt.</span></p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Computers have improved so much over the past three decades that it's hard to even describe the difference. The computer Fallows owned in 1982 had 48 kilobytes of memory. That was enough to store a few pages of text, but it would be too little to hold many modern webpages or even a single high-resolution photo. I'm typing this on a MacBook Air with eight gigabytes of memory — more than 100,000 times more.</p> \n<p>And the comically underpowered computers people bought in 1982 were expensive. Fallows spent about $4,000 for his, which would be more than $10,000 in today's dollars. In contrast, my MacBook Air cost me about $1,200.</p> \n<p>(Hat tip to <a href=""https://twitter.com/kevinroose/status/580491061325402113"" target=""_blank"">Kevin Roose</a>)</p>",Business & Finance
America's biggest airlines are accusing Persian Gulf carriers of cheating,http://www.vox.com/2015/3/27/8296495/gulf-airline-subsidies,"Emirates, Etihad, and Qatar have taken the aviation world by storm. The US airline lobby wants to put a stop to that.","<p>Three of America's four largest airlines — American, United, and Delta — have teamed up with the labor unions representing their workers to <a href=""http://fairskies.org/ourletter/"">form a coalition called Americans for Fair Skies</a>, which is demanding US government action against three major airlines based in the Persian Gulf that are cheating on existing international agreements. Bill Shuster, the Republican chair of the House Transportation Committee, <a href=""http://www.star-telegram.com/news/business/aviation/article15177896.html"">says the complaint has merit</a>, and the <a href=""http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/03/19/us-airlines-competition-regulator-idUSKBN0MF07D20150319"">Obama administration has agreed to review the matter</a>.</p> \n<p>The key complaint from the American airlines is that their three state-owned Gulf competitors — Emirates, Etihad, and Qatar — receive government subsidies that violate the terms of the existing Open Skies agreements between the US, the United Arab Emirates, and Qatar.</p> \n<p>But the real stakes are less about legal details than about whom US transportation policy should favor: American aviation workers or American travelers. A crackdown on Gulf airlines could mean more jobs and higher pay for US-based aviation workers. But it could also mean higher prices and less choice for American international fliers, especially those bound for Asia.</p> \n<h3>Government subsidies for Gulf airlines may have violated an agreement</h3> \n<p>Since 2001, the US has had an agreement with the government of the United Arab Emirates giving UAE-based airlines (specifically Emirates and Etihad) access to American airports, and vice versa. We have a similar agreement with Qatar, home to Qatar Airways. One stipulation of these agreements is that governments on both sides pledge not to subsidize their airlines.</p> \n<p>The goal of these Open Skies deals is to create a free, open, and undistorted market in international air travel with traffic between the US and Doha (or Abu Dhabi or Dubai), won by whichever airline does the best job of providing a compelling deal for passengers.</p> \n<p>Delta, America, and United have alleged for some time that Emirates, Etihad, and Qatar are all breaking this agreement. In March, they made their complaint formal and <a href=""http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/86598e3a-c358-11e4-9c27-00144feab7de.html#axzz3VQtq2728"">detailed to Robert Wright of the Financial Times</a> and US government officials their specific<strong> </strong>concerns based on what's known about Gulf airline finances:</p> \n<p><em>Against Emirates</em></p> \n<ul> \n<li>Government assumption of $2.4 billion in fuel hedging costs</li> \n<li>$2.3 billion in artificially low airport charges at its Dubai hub </li> \n<li>$1.9 billion in low labor costs due to non-union labor</li> \n</ul> \n<p><em>Against Etihad</em></p> \n<ul> \n<li>$6.3 billion in equity infusions from the emirate of Abu Dhabi, which owns the airline</li> \n<li>$4.6 billion in interest-free loans from Abu Dhabi</li> \n<li>$4.2 billion in unclearly specified ""additional committed subsidies""</li> \n</ul> \n<p><em>Against Qatar</em></p> \n<ul> \n<li>$7.7 billion in interest-free loans from the government of Qatar</li> \n<li>$6.8 billion in reduced interest costs due to sovereign guarantees for its borrowing</li> \n</ul> \n<p>The Gulf airlines counter that equity investments are not subsidies, that cheap labor and cheap airport fees simply reflect a pro-business policy environment, and that discount loans are the equivalent of the <a href=""http://www.cbsnews.com/news/9-11-airline-bailout-so-who-got-what/"">airline industry bailout</a> Congress approved in the wake of 9/11's disruption to the industry — financial assistance that arguably violated the terms of the Open Skies deal.</p> \n<p>The Economist's <a href=""http://www.economist.com/blogs/gulliver/2015/03/airline-subsidies-gulf"">Gulliver blog makes a game effort to adjudicate the claim</a>, but the basic reality is that there is no agreed-upon legal standard the US airlines' complaint needs to make. This is not a case that falls under World Trade Organization jurisdiction. It's simply up to the American political process. If the US government wants to cancel the Open Skies agreement it can, and if it doesn't want to it doesn't have to.</p> \n<h3>Should the US government protect passengers or airlines?</h3> \n<p>The political decision American officials need to reach is whom US aviation policy should benefit: US-based airlines or international air travelers. The stakes in the dispute are high because over the past 10 to 15 years the Gulf-based airlines have grown enormously.</p> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""3545460"" alt=""2_large-1.0.JPG"" src=""https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3545460/2_large-1.0.JPG""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">(<a href=""http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2015/01/04/boeings-new-love-affair-the-gulf-airlines.aspx"">Chart by Eshna Basu</a>, data from <a href=""http://www.iata.org/Pages/default.aspx"">IATA</a>)</p> \n<p>The real issue is not so much direct transportation between the US and the Gulf airlines' hubs, but rather the massive business all three airlines do in connecting Western travelers to Asia and vice versa.</p> \n<p>In other words, will a traveler from DC to Shanghai switch planes in California or in the UAE?</p> \n<p>Regardless of why the Gulf airlines have been so successful, their success has been a boon to long-haul air passengers and a disaster for competing airlines. This is true whether their market share has been gained through savvy marketing decisions or through under-the-table subsidies.</p> \n<p>Cheaper long-haul flights to Asia primarily benefit more affluent people, whereas the US-based airline industry's workforce is solidly middle-class. So one can see this as a case for a crackdown. On the other hand, the growth of Gulf airlines has been excellent news for America's airplane manufacturing industry and for US tourism, so the ultimate distributive consequences of a crackdown are by no means clear.</p> \n<h3>A different agreement could let Gulf airlines reduce domestic airfare</h3> \n<p>The logic of Gulf airlines' side of the case <em>could</em> be taken even further. The current Open Skies deal gives the Gulf carriers the right to fly from an American city to Doha or Dubai, but not to Boston or Baltimore. Foreign-owned carriers flying domestic routes inside the United States is called cabotage, and it's generally not allowed in order to protect the American airline industry.</p> \n<p>But with limited competition <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/24/business/dealbook/as-oil-prices-fall-air-fares-still-stay-high.html"">keeping airfares high despite falling oil costs</a>, it might be beneficial to take some of that protection away. After successive waves of bankruptcies and mergers, America's domestic airlines have become very cautious about expansion in a way that restrains competition and keeps fares high. The Gulf airlines, whether subsidized or not, have a spirit of gung-ho expansion that suggests they'd like to fly just about anywhere they're allowed.</p> \n<p>Right now, it isn't on the political agenda to take advantage of the Gulf's eagerness to increase routes in order to boost competition on US domestic routes, but it could be. For now, though, all the momentum seems to be on the other side.</p> \n<p><b>WATCH: 'The better way to board an airplane'</b></p> \n<!-- CHORUS_VIDEO_EMBED ChorusVideo:60190 -->",Business & Finance

The population of the Bay Area grew 1.3 percent last year, which is a lot better than the 0.7 percent average annual growth rate the Bay Area has seen since 2000.</p> \n<p>But it's also important to keep a sense of perspective: 1.3 percent is not a very impressive growth rate. The population of the Houston metropolitan area grew by 2.4 percent between 2013 and 2014. The Dallas metro area grew by 1.8 percent during the same period. Greater Atlanta grew by 1.5 percent.</p> \n<p>And these southern cities have been growing faster than the San Francisco Bay Area for more than a decade. Between 2000 and 2010, the Bay Area grew by about 5 percent. Houston, Dallas, and Atlanta all increased their populations by more than 20 percent.</p> \n<p>The crazy thing about this is that while Atlanta, Dallas, and Houston all have perfectly healthy economies (Houston especially has benefited from an oil boom for much of the last decade), none of them compare Silicon Valley's.</p> \n<p>Google, <span>Apple, Facebook, and other internet giants are growing fast, and they're desperate to hire more engineers. </span><span>The Bay Area should be comfortably topping the population-growth charts among large metropolitan areas.

The legislation was designed to combat the problem of patent trolls — companies that make their money by threatening patent lawsuits rather than by making useful products. The idea enjoyed the support of Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-VT) and several senior Republicans in the Senate.</p> \n<p>But last May, Leahy announced that he was shelving his patent reform bill, and insiders told me he <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/5/23/5742620/patent-reform-is-dead-heres-who-killed-it"">did this at Reid's request</a>. Reid has a close relationships with trial lawyers' groups, who opposed the bill. Plaintiffs' lawyers were concerned that the bill's ""loser pays"" provision — which allows winning defendants in patent cases to collect legal fees from plaintiffs — could later be expanded to apply to non-patent cases.</p> \n<p>By contrast, Schumer is an<span> advocate of patent reform and </span><span>was one of Leahy's key allies in the patent fight. That makes sense given his constituency; New York is home to both Wall Street and a lot of technology startups, and both groups are frequent targets of patent trolls.</span></p> \n<p>On a lot of issues, it <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/3/27/8299765/harry-reid-successor"">doesn't really matter</a> who the party leaders are because their caucuses already have strong opinions. Harry Reid was personally pro-life, but he's been forced to reflect the views of his overwhelmingly pro-choice caucus. But patent issues aren't like that. There are Democrats on both sides of the issue, and a number of senators who don't have a strong opinion on the issue one way or the other. So who leads the Democrats can have a big impact.</p> \n<p>Of course, if Republicans pass a strong patent reform bill this year — which they might — then this could be a non-issue by the time Reid's successor takes over in 2017. But given how slowly the legislative process moves, there's a good chance this will still be a live debate if and when Schumer takes charge.</p>",Business & Finance
"Oil prices crashed, but US output is still rising. How long can that last?",http://www.vox.com/2015/3/27/8301165/oil-production-low-prices,"You would think low prices would throttle America's oil industry. Surprisingly, that hasn't happened yet.","<p>One of the biggest energy stories of the last decade has been the vast oil boom in the United States. But how long can it last?</p> \n<p>When oil prices were soaring during the mid-2000s, energy companies found it highly profitable to use <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/fracking"">fracking</a>, horizontal drilling, and other techniques to extract oil from shale formations in places like Texas and North Dakota. The result: a glut of oil and <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/12/16/7401705/oil-prices-falling"">a major crash in global oil prices</a> back in 2014.</p> \n<p>What's surprising, though, is that US oil output has <em>kept</em> growing even though oil prices have fallen by half since last summer. On March 25, the US Energy Information Administration <a href=""http://www.eia.gov/petroleum/weekly/crude.cfm"">announced</a> that US crude production rose yet again to 9.42 million barrels per day — the highest level since 1973:</p> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3548664/chart__1_.0.png"" alt=""chart__1_.0.png"" data-chorus-asset-id=""3548664""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">(<a href=""http://www.eia.gov/petroleum/weekly/crude.cfm"" target=""_blank"">Energy Information Administration</a>)</p> \n<p>This is pretty astonishing. After all, it costs more to frack oil from shale rock in North Dakota than it does to pump out oil from conventional fields, like those in Saudi Arabia or Kuwait. <span>So, when prices were dropping last year, many onlookers </span><a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/12/16/7401705/oil-prices-falling"">figured</a><span> it would wipe out the US oil industry. (Some Saudi officials were reportedly </span>hoping<span> this would be the case.) Yet America's oil production has stayed remarkably resilient.</span></p> \n<h3>US drillers have felt the pinch from low prices — but they're also adapting</h3> \n<p>US oil drillers have certainly been affected by the recent crash. The price of West Texas Intermediate fell from $95 per barrel in July 2014 to less than $50 per barrel today. The result? It's less profitable for many companies to keep pumping for oil in difficult shale formations the way they used to.</p> \n<p>To some extent, you see this in the data. The number of active drilling rigs has been declining steadily since the crash. On March 20, <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=79687&amp;p=irol-reportsother"">according to data</a> from Baker Hughes, there were 825 active oil drilling rigs in the United States. That's plummeted from 1,473 rigs a year ago. Here's a chart from Business Insider:</p> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3548672/rigs-1.0.png"" alt=""rigs-1.0.png"" data-chorus-asset-id=""3548672""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">(Chart: <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/baker-hughes-rig-count-march-27-2015-3"">Business Insider</a>, Data: Baker Hughes)</p> \n<p>But that hasn't translated to a decrease in US oil production yet. Why is that? As the Energy Information Administration <a href=""http://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.cfm?id=20392"">explains</a>, when oil companies start idling their drilling rigs, they generally start with the older, least-efficient rigs first. That's then offset by output from the remaining rigs, which are in the most productive, oil-rich regions.</p> \n<p>What's more, as Ed Crooks <a href=""http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/372e52bc-c98b-11e4-a2d9-00144feab7de.html#axzz3VbaJ7OiY"">recently reported</a> in the Financial Times, US oil companies are finding ways to pump oil more efficiently. They're putting pressure on suppliers to cut costs. They're adopting new techniques and technologies like <a href=""http://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.cfm?id=7910"" target=""_blank"">""pad drilling,""</a> which allows them to drill multiple wells in tight clusters with fewer rigs. Add it all up, and oil output per rig has risen 29 percent in North Dakota's Bakken region and 30 percent in West Texas's Permian Basin.</p> \n<h3>But US oil production likely won't keep growing indefinitely — and is expected to taper off later this year</h3> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3548684/GettyImages-467701296.0.0.jpg"" alt=""GettyImages-467701296.0.0.jpg"" data-chorus-asset-id=""3548684""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">An oil pump-jack is viewed on March 26, 2015, in the oil town of Gonzales, Texas. (Spencer Platt/Getty Images)</p> \n<p>That dynamic can't last forever, though. Most of the oil wells drilled in the shale regions of North Dakota and Texas tend to produce a lot of crude very early on and then start declining sharply within a few years. (Output from a typical well in the Bakken <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.nga.org/files/live/sites/NGA/files/pdf/2014/1412ShaleDevelopmentStateFiscalPolicies_Haggerty.pdf"">declines by 65 percent</a> after the first year.)</p> \n<p>So over time, oil producers will need to keep drilling new wells to maintain production. But it's costly to drill a new well, and low oil prices make this a less-attractive proposition at the margins. Companies like EOG Resources and Hess <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/372e52bc-c98b-11e4-a2d9-00144feab7de.html#axzz3VbaJ7OiY"">have already announced cuts</a> to capital spending this year.</p> \n<p>The EIA, for its part, recently noted that this crunch has already started to hit certain shale regions, albeit unevenly. Crude oil production in the Permian Basin in West Texas is expected to rise through April 2015. But production in other shale regions, like the Bakken in North Dakota or Eagle Ford in East Texas, <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.cfm?id=20392"">is expected to decline slightly</a>:</p> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3548692/main.0.png"" alt=""main.0.png"" data-chorus-asset-id=""3548692""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">(<a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.cfm?id=20392"">Energy Information Administration</a>)</p> \n<p>Indeed, while the recent growth in oil production has been impressive, last week's gain was actually the smallest since January. And the International Energy Agency <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.iea.org/oilmarketreport/omrpublic/currentreport/"">expects</a> US oil production to plateau sometime in the middle of this year, at least if prices stay around $60 per barrel.

Can Amazon make hiring a plumber as easy as buying an iPad?,http://www.vox.com/2015/3/30/8314069/amazon-home-services,Millions of customers love buying products on Amazon with one click. Can Amazon do the same thing for home services?,"<p>Amazon has made it almost effortless to purchase a book, an iPad, or thousands of other physical products. You find the product you want online and order with one click, and it shows up at your door a few days later.</p> \n<p>Now Amazon is trying to do the same thing for personal services like plumbing, lawn mowing, and music lessons. Amazon Home Services, which has been under development for the past year but officially launches today, promises to let people order personal services in much the same way that they've always ordered physical goods, complete with customer reviews and a money-back guarantee.</p> \n<p>But it won't be easy to make ordering services online as effortless as ordering physical goods. While iPads come in a few well-defined models, every plumbing job is different. A lot of companies have tried to sell services online, and so far none of them has figured out how to make the process as easy as ordering a book online.</p> \n<h3>Amazon is entering a crowded market</h3> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3555890/450831356.0.jpg"" alt=""450831356.0.jpg"" data-chorus-asset-id=""3555890""></p> \n<p> </p> \n<p class=""caption"">(David Ryder/Getty Images)</p> \n<p> </p> \n<p>In the past, when you needed to hire someone to trim your trees or change your oil, you'd pull out the Yellow Pages and make a call. The internet has changed this process in some respects — you're more likely to use Google or Craigslist rather than the phone book — but the customer is still forced to do a lot of the work himself. Customers need to check a provider's references, verify that they're properly licensed and insured, and negotiate a fair price. For many customers, it's a stressful and intimidating experience.</p> \n<p>A number of technology companies have been trying to make this process easier. Angie's List started out as a Yelp-style review site for services, but in recent years it's increasingly acted as a middleman, matching customers with service providers directly. Amazon competitor eBay <a href=""http://techcrunch.com/2013/11/14/ebay-debuts-new-angies-list-competitor-and-local-service-provider-marketplace-ebayhire-in-the-us/?source=email_rt_mc_body&amp;app=n"">launched a service</a> called eBayHire in 2013, though it seems to have abandoned the product since then.</p> \n<p>There are also newer startups, including <a href=""https://www.taskrabbit.com/"">TaskRabbit</a> and <a href=""http://www.thumbtack.com/"">Thumbtack</a>, that help customers order services online.</p> \n<p>Amazon brings two big assets to this already crowded market. One is its brand. As the nation's largest online retailer, Amazon has earned the trust of millions of American consumers. In a market where customers are nervous about getting subpar services, the Amazon brand could help put skeptical customers at ease.</p> \n<p>Second, Amazon has a lot of experience partnering with third-party providers. While Amazon's original business model was to sell products it owned from its own warehouse, much of the company's recent growth has been from listing products from third-party providers on its site. So Amazon knows how to recruit third-party providers, vet them for quality, field customer complaints, and make the entire process seamless for users.</p> \n<p>According to TechCrunch, <a href=""http://techcrunch.com/2015/03/30/amazon-home-services-gets-its-official-launch/"">Amazon is working</a> with some of these smaller service startups, such as TaskRabbit, to help deliver services to customers.</p> \n<h3>Why selling services online is hard</h3> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3555896/170493098.0.jpg"" alt=""170493098.0.jpg"" data-chorus-asset-id=""3555896""></p> \n<p> </p> \n<p class=""caption"">(MyLoupe/UIG via Getty Images)</p> \n<p> </p> \n<p>There are a lot of successful startups that sell physical products like shoes and sunglasses. But the services market seems to be a tougher nut to crack.</p> \n<p>A big reason for this is standardization. When you sell physical products, you often have to keep track of a lot of different variations — a single line of shoes, for example, can come in many colors and sizes — but they're still well-defined and standardized. So when you order shoes online, you can tell exactly what you're getting.</p> \n<p>But services are performed by individual human beings, which makes them inherently difficult to standardize. The fact that a plumbing company did a good job on my neighbor's toilet last week doesn't guarantee that it will do a good job on mine this week, since it might not send out the same guy.</p> \n<p>""They’re shoehorning local services into the same way they treat other products,"" Thumbtack CEO Marco Zappacosta <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/ryanmac/2014/11/25/amazon-quietly-reveals-local-services-push-with-new-web-page/"">told Forbes</a>. ""What about building a deck? Your deck is going to be different than my deck and your backyard is going to be different than my backyard.""</p> \n<p>A lot of services have this character: it's impossible to say exactly what a professional can do and how much the service will cost without a personalized evaluation. And that runs against the grain of Amazon's business model, which is all about using technology to streamline the purchasing process.</p> \n<p>Still, there are probably some services that can be standardized. For example, Amazon's move into services began with a pilot program that was focused on installation of products customers had bought. If you bought a flat-screen TV, Amazon would offer to connect customers with a professional who would mount it on the wall. That's a simple enough service that it probably is possible to offer uniform pricing. The big question is whether this is the norm or a rare exception.</p>",Business & Finance

His visual style — which mostly consists of making the world <span>look all jittery and stretched out as those</span> super-fast cars pass by — defines that first film in a big way.</p> \n<p>The second film was directed by <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005436/?ref_=nv_sr_1"">John Singleton</a>, a great director who also made <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0101507/?ref_=nm_knf_i3""><em>Boyz N the Hood</em></a><em> </em>but who seemed to fundamentally misunderstand that a <em>Fast &amp; Furious</em> movie should never be too serious.</p> \n<p>The next four films were directed by <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0510912/?ref_=nv_sr_1"">Justin Lin</a>, one of the best action directors working right now. Now that he's left the franchise, he'll be directing the <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2660888/?ref_=nm_flmg_dr_4"" target=""_blank"">next <i>Star Trek</i> movie</a>. He's a good choice.</p> \n<p>What Lin understands intuitively is that action sequences require long shots that will establish geography, so we have a better idea of what's happening to whom, and when. <span>Here's a great example of how he establishes the geography of a major chase in </span><em>Fast Five</em><span>:</span></p> \n<div> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3558376/ffgeography.0.gif"" alt=""ffgeography.0.gif"" data-chorus-asset-id=""3558376""></p> \n</div> \n<p>The seventh film is directed by <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1490123/?ref_=nv_sr_1"">James Wan</a>, best known for his horror work on movies like <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0387564/?ref_=nm_knf_t1""><em>Saw</em></a> and <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1457767/?ref_=nv_sr_1""><em>The Conjuring</em></a>. He's an expert at building tension, something he uses to great effect throughout <em>Furious 7</em>.</p> \n<p>It's also worth pointing out that films three through seven are all written by <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0604555/?ref_=nv_sr_1"" target=""new"">Chris Morgan</a>, who has become a kind of steward of the characters.</p> \n<h3>Who are the most important characters?</h3> \n<p>The crazy thing about the <em>Fast &amp; Furious</em> franchise is that no single character has appeared in all seven films. This isn't a conscious choice in the way it might be in, say, the Marvel movies, where all the characters have their own solo adventures before coming together in <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0848228/?ref_=nv_sr_2""><em>Avengers</em></a> films. Many of the actors split off to have more successful careers elsewhere — only to come back when those careers didn't exactly pay off.</p> \n<p>Here's a quick look at who's appeared in which <em>Fast &amp; Furious</em> films.</p> \n<div> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3558278/fast_and_furious_timeline-10.0.png"" alt=""fast_and_furious_timeline-10.0.png"" data-chorus-asset-id=""3558278""></p> \n</div> \n<p>These characters break down into four main groups.</p> \n<p><strong>The main four: </strong>This includes former LAPD officer and FBI agent <strong>Brian O'Conner</strong> (<a href=""http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0908094/?ref_=nv_sr_1"">Paul Walker</a>), who sets the series in motion by trying to get close to street racer and small-time criminal <strong>Dom Toretto</strong> (<a href=""http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0004874/?ref_=nv_sr_1"">Vin Diesel</a>) and his girlfriend <strong>Leticia ""Letty"" Ortiz</strong> (<a href=""http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0735442/?ref_=nv_sr_1"">Michelle Rodriguez</a>). Naturally, Brian gets in too deep and falls for Dom's sister, <strong>Mia</strong> (<a href=""http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0108287/?ref_=nv_sr_1"">Jordana Brewster</a>). The constant twists and turns in the relationships of these four characters drive every movie but the second and third ones, though Brian is still the main character of <em>2 Fast</em>.</p> \n<p><strong>The rest of the crew: </strong>These are the characters who sign up with the main four to pull off impossible schemes. <strong>Roman Pearce </strong>(<a href=""http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0879085/?ref_=nv_sr_1"">Tyrese Gibson</a>) and <strong>Tej Parker </strong>(<a href=""http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0524839/?ref_=nv_sr_1"">Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges</a>) joined the franchise in <em>2 Fast</em>, before becoming its comic relief in <em>Fast Five</em>. <strong>Han</strong> <strong>Seoul-Oh</strong> (<a href=""http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0437646/?ref_=nv_sr_1"">Sung Kang</a>) is a wryly philosophical drift racer from Tokyo who proved so popular that the franchise resurrected him. (More on this in a bit.) <strong>Gisele Yashar</strong> (<a href=""http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2933757/?ref_=nv_sr_1"">Gal Gadot</a>) is a relatively minor character in <em>Fast &amp; Furious</em> who joins the crew more fully in <em>Fast Five</em> and develops a relationship with Han. (Also in this classification but not in our graphic are <strong>Tego Leo </strong>[<a href=""http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1578798/?ref_=nv_sr_1"">Tego Calderón</a>] and <strong>Rico Santos </strong>[<a href=""http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1885797/?ref_=nv_sr_1"">Don Omar</a>].)</p> \n<p><strong>Friends in law enforcement: </strong>These characters start out as <em>Fast Five</em> antagonists but quickly realize our heroes are the good guys and help them take out supercriminals. They include <strong>Luke Hobbs</strong> (<a href=""http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0425005/?ref_=nv_sr_1"">Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson</a>), who is basically <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000169/?ref_=nv_sr_1"">Tommy Lee Jones</a>'s relentless pursuer from <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0106977/?ref_=nm_knf_t4""><em>The Fugitive</em></a> until he and Dom become best pals, and <strong>Elena Neves </strong>(<a href=""http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0665235/?ref_=nv_sr_1"">Elsa Pataky</a>), a Brazilian police officer who's the only non-corrupt cop in Rio or something.</p> \n<p><strong>Sean: Sean Boswell</strong> (<a href=""http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0085407/?ref_=nv_sr_1"">Lucas Black</a>) is the protagonist of <em>Tokyo Drift</em>. Because of the series' wacky chronology, he sat out three movies and is returning in <em>Furious 7</em>. But don't get too excited for him to join the series full-time — he's only in a couple of scenes.</p> \n<h3>What's this about wacky chronology?</h3> \n<p>The most beautiful thing about the <em>Fast &amp; Furious</em> franchise is that it accidentally invented a prequel trilogy, then stuck it in the middle of the run, and it's all because Vin Diesel wanted to make more <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chronicles_of_Riddick_(franchise)""><em>Riddick</em> movies</a>.</p> \n<p>As mentioned, <em>Tokyo Drift</em> has nothing to do with either of the two movies preceding it, but audiences sparked to the character of Han, who trains Sean in the ways of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drifting_(motorsport)"">drift racing</a>. (This involves sliding around a curve, seemingly perpendicular to the road, in a way that seems almost magical when done well.) In the course of that film, Han dies after a race. At the film's end, when Sean has taken the title of Drift King, he is challenged by a new racer — who turns out to be Dom, who says Han used to ride with his crew back in the day.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""left"">It's all because Vin Diesel wanted to make more Riddick movies</q></p> \n<p>Diesel was hoping to make more films in the <em>Riddick</em> franchise of sci-fi action pictures. To do that, though, he needed to get the rights for the character from Universal, which also produced the <em>Fast &amp; Furious</em> movies. He agreed to cameo at the end of <em>Tokyo Drift</em> — as a promise of his return to the franchise in a fourth film (which eventually happened) — but instead of payment, <a href=""http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/vin-diesel-traded-fast-furious-619386"">he asked for the <i>Riddick</i> rights</a>. Universal gave them to him, and another <i>Riddick</i> movie came out in 2013.</p> \n<p>These two things — Han's popularity and Diesel's cameo mentioning Han — combine to create the franchise's twisty timeline. Wouldn't it be fun to see Dom hanging out with Han? Yes. Yes it would. This meant that for Han to be alive in the next three films, <em>Tokyo Drift</em> had to take place <em>after</em> them. Then, Han's death is repeated at the end of <em>Fast &amp; Furious 6</em>, revealing the villain of <em>Furious 7</em> to be behind his death.</p> \n<p>Thus, the chronological order of the films is 1 - 2 - 4 - 5 - 6 - 3 - 7, and the third film (in which everybody uses flip phones and instant messaging programs) technically takes place sometime in the 2010s, even if it was released in 2006.</p> \n<p>Here's a visual representation of that timeline.</p> \n<div> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3558286/fast_and_furious_timeline-01.0.png"" alt=""fast_and_furious_timeline-01.0.png"" data-chorus-asset-id=""3558286""></p> \n</div> \n<h3>So do I have to watch the movies in that order?</h3> \n<p>Nah. You could watch these movies in literally any order and be fine. The chronology is complex, but it's not incomprehensible or anything.</p> \n<p>Your best bet, then, is the same as it is with <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chronicles_of_Narnia""><em>The Chronicles of Narnia</em></a> (another series where chronology doesn't reflect release order): watch in release order. You'll be fine! We promise!</p> \n<h3>This is a lot. Can I possibly take a music break with a song that endlessly repeats one of the film's titles?</h3> \n<p>And how!</p> \n<p><iframe width=""420"" height=""315"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/TA7gnSyuIik"" frameborder=""0""></iframe></p> \n<p>This is ""Act a Fool"" by Ludacris, from <em>2 Fast 2 Furious</em>. It is the most memorable thing about that film, if only because you will essentially be forced to now say the film's title in the same cadence as the song.</p> \n<h3>How do the <em>Fast &amp; Furious</em> films fit into the overall Hollywood landscape?</h3> \n<p>Make no mistake: <em>Fast &amp; Furious</em> is one of the most important franchises in Hollywood. If you look at the box office totals for the first seven films above, you'll see that — outside of the blip for <em>Tokyo Drift</em> — they keep going up and up and up.</p> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""6688365"" alt=""Fast_Furious_box.0.png"" src=""https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6688365/Fast_Furious_box.0.png""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">(Javier Zarracina/Vox)</p> \n<p>What's more, the franchise has been almost perfectly cultivated by its studio. Really, the only comparable franchise in Hollywood right now is the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe"">Marvel Cinematic Universe</a>, over at Disney. And the films reflect how Hollywood has changed as they've been made.</p> \n<p>Here are a few ways they reflect those changes.</p> \n<p><strong>The films basically switch genres with <em>Fast Five</em>. </strong>For the first four films, this is a franchise about car racing and big chase sequences, with those elements mixing into fairly standard crime thriller plots. In <em>Fast Five</em>, however, the franchise takes a hard right turn into the heist movie genre, with only one (very short) car chase. And <em>Fast &amp; Furious 6</em> is much closer to <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Bond_in_film"">a James Bond movie</a> than anything else, with the characters having to take down a villain who could destroy the world. The franchise always prominently features cars, and the solution to every problem is always ""more cars,"" but these aren't ""car movies"" anymore. It's a neat trick.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""center"">Make no mistake: Fast &amp; Furious is one of the most important franchises in Hollywood</q></p> \n<p><strong>The franchise switches templates with <em>Fast &amp; Furious.</em> </strong>Before the fourth film in the franchise, this is basically <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halloween_(franchise)"">the <em>Halloween</em> franchise</a> — three films, where the third has essentially no connection to the first two other than genre. With the fourth, though, the films accidentally become (thanks to the addition of Han to the main cast) a shared universe, where all of the characters are involved in one another's adventures — and they get there a few years before Marvel would. Along the way, they also make a stop in ""the bad guys are good guys now!"" territory, straight out of the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminator_(franchise)""><em>Terminator</em> movies</a>.</p> \n<p><strong>The films have a surprisingly deep mythology: </strong>Okay, it's not Marvel levels of deep, but that franchise has decades of comic books propping it up. And from the fourth movie on, the story of the franchise has been <em>one</em> story, which slowly builds on previously established character relationships and plot twists. It's kind of like a giant, cinematic TV show.</p> \n<h3>What are the best action sequences in each film, ideally complete with GIFs?</h3> \n<p>Here are some great moments from each film in GIF form.</p> \n<p><strong><em>The Fast and the Furious</em>:</strong> Here's a quick look at how the first film portrays going really fast in a car like traveling through hyperspace in the <em>Star Wars</em> movies.</p> \n<div><img data-chorus-asset-id=""3558378"" alt=""ff1.0.gif"" src=""https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3558378/ff1.0.gif""></div> \n<p><strong><em>2 Fast 2 Furious</em>: </strong>Literally the only moment of note in this film is when Brian jumps a car onto a boat.

It's true love!</p> \n<div><img data-chorus-asset-id=""3558388"" alt=""ff6.0.gif"" src=""https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3558388/ff6.0.gif""></div> \n<p><b><i>Furious 7</i>: </b>The seventh film has by far the most computer-assisted visual effects in the series, as you can see in this scene where Brian runs up the side of a bus that's falling off a cliff and leaps to grab hold of Letty's car. It's crazy and over-the-top in the series' best sense.</p> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6685109/fast7jump.0.gif"" alt=""Furious 7"" data-chorus-asset-id=""6685109""></p> \n<h3>Why are these movies so successful?</h3> \n<p>It's impossible to say <em>why</em>, of course, other than the fact that they are hugely entertaining blockbusters, with just the right amount of character work to go with the giant stunts. But here are my five best guesses.</p> \n<p><strong>1) The movies feel <em>real</em>. </strong>Though there are plenty of computer-assisted visual effects throughout the series, the franchise attempts to actually <a href=""http://www.complex.com/sports/2013/05/the-17-most-insane-stunts-from-fast-furious-movies-in-gifs/getting-tanked"">perform as many stunts as it can</a>. This means that when the cars crash, some stunt driver really crashed a car. It underlines the verisimilitude of much of what happens onscreen, no matter how ridiculous. This is really happening to these characters in our universe, it seems to say, not in some fantastical one.</p> \n<p><strong>2) The movies' dramatic stakes build slowly. </strong>The stakes of the first film literally hinge on Brian deciding whether to betray Dom. That's it. Even in <em>Fast Five</em>, the stakes involve ripping off one man — albeit the most powerful criminal in all of Rio de Janeiro. It's only in <em>Fast &amp; Furious 6</em> that the idea of ""saving the world"" comes into play, and it's almost always an afterthought there, because ...</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""right"">It is the most sensitive movie franchise out there, and the most sentimental</q></p> \n<p><strong>3) Personal stakes are always more important than plot stakes. </strong>The major story of these films is the relationships between the characters and how they shift and change. If you ever watch a <em>Fast &amp; Furious</em> movie, there is at least a half-hour — and often more — smack-dab in the middle of the movie where the characters talk about how they feel about each other. The action sequences become seasoning, sprinkled throughout the rest of the story to heighten it, not to define it. The series defines itself by questions of honor, friendship, family, and redemption. It is the most sensitive major franchise out there, and the most sentimental. (See also: the <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2NvoYKf7S0"">tear-jerking end</a> of <i>Furious 7</i>.)</p> \n<p><strong>4) The cast is very diverse. </strong>It seems no coincidence to me that the rise of <em>Fast &amp; Furious</em> — largely on the backs of films made by a Taiwanese-American director — came right as Hollywood was realizing people of color were hungry for stories in which they were prominently featured. Of the series' major actors, only Walker fits the usual white-guy-hero mold of most Hollywood films. (Diesel's full ethnicity is unknown, though he's said he's <a href=""http://jam.canoe.ca/Movies/Artists/D/Diesel_Vin/2000/02/17/757953.html"" target=""_blank"">""definitely a person of color.""</a>) That's proved quietly revolutionary.</p> \n<p><strong>5) This series isn't afraid to be stupid. </strong>From Tej and Roman's comic relief to Hobbs's frequent one-liners to the sheer ridiculousness of many of the series' stunts, there is nothing in <em>Fast &amp; Furious</em> that is above broadly winking at the audience about how silly this is. That lack of self-seriousness is hugely welcome in the current blockbuster climate — and another link between this franchise and the Marvel movies.</p> \n<h3>What's next for the franchise?</h3> \n<p>The eighth film is coming (and will star Charlize Theron and <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.cnn.com/2016/06/16/entertainment/helen-mirren-fast-and-furious-8/"">Helen Mirren</a>!), but <a href=""http://articles.latimes.com/2014/mar/25/local/la-me-ln-paul-walker-death-report-20140325"">Walker died in a 2013 car accident</a>, so the series will have to pivot from the relationship that formed its core for most of the first seven films. (Walker had completed enough of <em>Furious 7 </em>to appear in that film, and the filmmakers were able to construct a fitting coda for his character.)</p> \n<p>One thing's for certain, though: whenever the eighth film arrives, it will probably involve Vin Diesel staring at a seemingly unsolvable problem, then smiling and driving a car through it.</p> \n<p><b>WATCH: 'Every Fast and Furious movie plot in 10 minutes'</b></p> \n<!-- CHORUS_VIDEO_EMBED ChorusVideo:67878 -->",Business & Finance
Amazon's new Dash Button is the future of computing,http://www.vox.com/2015/3/31/8319955/amazon-dash-button-future,"A button for ordering laundry detergent might seem silly, but we're going to see a lot more simple, single-purpose computing devices in the future.","<p>Amazon has a new product that seems so simple, it's hard to believe it's a product at all:</p> \n<p><iframe frameborder=""0"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/NMacTuHPWFI"" height=""315"" width=""560""></iframe></p> \n<p>It's called the <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.amazon.com/oc/dash-button?reqInv=1"">Amazon Dash Button</a>. It's a small plastic device with a button and a light. When you press the button, it sends a message to Amazon to order a refill of some product, like a new bottle of Tide laundry detergent or a new order of Gillette razor blades. And that's all it does.</p> \n<p>Dash Buttons have adhesive backs, and the idea is you'd stick them near the place where you store each product. So you'd put the Tide button on your washing machine, the Cascade soap button on your dishwasher, the Folgers coffee button on your coffee machine, and the Gillette razor button inside your medicine cabinet. That way, as soon as you notice you're running low, you can push the button to order more, saving you the minute or two it would take to browse Amazon's website to find that same product.</p> \n<h3>Cheap, specialized gadgets are the future</h3> \n<p><span>I don't know if the Dash Button is going to be a big hit. But regardless, it's a good example of how the plummeting cost of computer chips can change how people interact with computers.</span></p> \n<p>Amazon's website doesn't have a lot of technical details, but the Dash Button appears to be a tiny, battery-operated computer with a built-in wifi chip, capable of connecting to the internet, just like your laptop, iPad, and Kindle can.</p> \n<p><span>Two decades ago it would have been crazy to build a product like this. A PC capable of connecting to the internet cost $1,000 to $2,000. Because most families could only afford to own one or two PCs, they were designed to be all-purpose machines with a wide variety of applications.</span></p> \n<p>By the end of the last decade, costs had fallen to the point where you could build an internet-connected computer for $100 to $200. Now, a typical family could afford to buy 10 or 20 of these devices instead of just one or two. So we started to see more single-purpose computing devices: Kindles for reading, iPod Touches for listening to music, wifi baby monitors for keeping track of sleeping infants, and so forth.</p> \n<p>Yet these devices were still expensive enough that it only made sense to buy one if it provided a lot of value. People aren't going to spend $200 on a device they only use a few times a year.</p> \n<p>But prices have continued to fall. We're now <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/5/8/5590228/how-tiny-computers-could-change-the-way-we-live"" target=""_blank"">getting close to the point</a> where you can build an internet-connected computer for $10 or $20. Suddenly, applications that seemed frivolous at $1,000 or $100 look sensible. It would be silly to spend $100 or $1,000 for a light bulb that you can turn off with your smartphone, but if it only costs $10, it might be worth it.</p> \n<p>And this is also cheap enough to open up a lot of new business-model options. You might not be willing to pay $10 or 20 for a button that automatically orders Tide detergent, but I bet Tide would be happy to buy it for you!</p> \n<p>And there's every reason to expect these costs to keep falling. If current trends continue, internet-connected computers will only cost $1 or $2 by the 2030s. At that price, no application will be too frivolous. Expect the average family to have dozens, and probably hundreds, of simple connected devices.</p> \n<p>And in this sense, the Dash Button is the future of computing. People will still have PCs and smartphones, of course. But the vast majority of the computing devices they own will be single-purpose devices that cost just a few dollars.</p>",Business & Finance
Ford hopes China's love of chauffeurs could save America's luxury cars,http://www.vox.com/2015/4/1/8325277/lincoln-continental-china,The new Lincoln Continental is all about the pleasures of being driven.,"<p>Ford has been enjoying a decent run of business lately thanks to the enormous popularity of its F-150 trucks plus some smaller sedans. But one sign that the company still exists in a somewhat fallen state is that its Lincoln luxury sub-brand is still a minnow compared to the major German and Japanese luxury marques.</p> \n<p>The company is hoping to change that with the <a href=""http://www.theverge.com/2015/3/31/8315147/lincoln-continental-concept-photos-nyias-2015"">latest edition of the Lincoln Continental</a>, announced yesterday in concept version in New York.</p> \n<p>But there's an interesting twist. Ford's plans for reviving a once-iconic American brand are all about China — where chaffeurs are cheaper to hire and Lincoln doesn't have a tarnished reputation.</p> \n<h3>A car for people with chauffeurs, not for driving enthusiasts</h3> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3562860/lincoln-continental-015-2040.0.0.0.jpg"" alt=""lincoln-continental-015-2040.0.0.0.jpg"" data-chorus-asset-id=""3562860""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">(The Verge)</p> \n<p>The new Continental has a classic external style and a not-super-impressive V6 engine. But the interior and especially the back seat really stand out. It features a mini desk with a built-in touchscreen that offers seat controls, an entertainment system, and some not-yet-specified communications functions. A person sitting in the back can control the front passenger seat to make more room for himself, and the right rear seat features a footrest that can expand at the expense of the front passenger.</p> \n<p>Which is to say that this is a car whose target market is people who are driven around by a chauffeur.</p> \n<p>Such people exist in the United States, of course, but it's rare. For one thing, few people can afford it. But beyond that, America has a car culture and even prosperous people often want to put their luxury money behind a car that's fun to drive rather than a car that's optimized for backseat sitting. BMW markets itself as the Ultimate Driving Machine, not the Ultimate Riding Around Machine.</p> \n<h3>Ford thinks Chauffeurs are big in China</h3> \n<p>In China, the situation is a bit different. Wages are lower, so it's much cheaper to hire a  driver there than it is in the United States. And because the whole country was so poor so recently, few Chinese people have the kind of multi-generational commitment to driving that's common in the US. Over there, the thinking goes, the kind of person interested in paying a premium price for a premium car really is interested in sitting in the back seat.</p> \n<p>China is already the world's largest market for cars overall. In the luxury segment, it's number two behind the United States. Even with Chinese economic growth slowing down, it's a fair bet that the <em>growth</em> in the Chinese luxury market will be enormous as it matures.</p> \n<p>At the unveiling event, Lincoln President Kumar Galhotra reportedly told journalists that even though luxury cars are only 9 to 10 percent of all cars on the road they represent almost one-third of all profits.</p> \n<h3>A new beginning, or a new Town Car?</h3> \n<p>The less polite version of the case for the China-first strategy is <a href=""http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/84b5d322-d726-11e4-93cb-00144feab7de.html#axzz3VsJv7FI9"">offered by Robert Wright of the Financial Times</a> who says ""Lincoln has built much of its strategy around appealing to Chinese consumers who have not been put off the brand by the decades when it focused on poor-quality vehicles popular mainly with US car services.""</p> \n<p>The focus is on China, in other words, because the Lincoln brand is tarnished in the United States.</p> \n<p>Here in the company's home market, perception of the Lincoln brand is heavily influenced by the now-defunct Town Car — a very large but not especially high-quality vehicle optimized for fleet sales. Not so much a true luxury item for the chauffeur set as a moderately classy ride to the airport. One question for Lincoln is whether this chauffeur luxury market genuinely exists. By the numbers, after all, the <a href=""http://www.motorauthority.com/news/1096204_bmw-is-most-successful-luxury-car-brand-in-2014-with-1-8-million-sales"">#1 luxury brand in China is BMW — just like in the United States</a>.</p> \n<p>That suggests that as the Continental shifts from concept car to production model, actual driving quality will still be the key to its success. If Lincoln hopes to truly compete with the top luxury brands — rather than recreating the Town Car under a new name — they need to make a car people want to drive, not just be driven around in.</p>",Business & Finance

Why it's hard for women to prove systematic discrimination in court,http://www.vox.com/2015/4/1/8326221/pao-sexism-data-silicon-valley,The Ellen Pao case showed that sexism can be hard to spot and harder to prove. Here's how data can stop it before it starts.,"<p>When Ellen Pao launched her high-profile lawsuit against the venture capital firm of Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers, she became a hero to feminists who believe Silicon Valley has a pervasive problem with workplace sexism. But while Pao provided some vivid examples of sexist attitudes by some of her male Kleiner Perkins coworkers, a jury found that she hadn't proved that these attitudes were the reason she wasn't promoted as quickly as some of her male colleagues.</p> \n<p>While Pao's case might be over, the broader debate about gender discrimination in Silicon Valley will continue. Women at <a href=""http://money.cnn.com/2015/03/18/technology/facebook-discrimination-suit/"">Facebook</a> and <a href=""http://money.cnn.com/2015/03/24/technology/twitter-sex-discrimination-lawsuit/"">Twitter</a> have alleged that they missed out on opportunities because of gender discrimination.</p> \n<p>Pao's loss in court showed that women can face an uphill battle in proving their claims in court. Many legal experts agree that proving to a jury that an atmosphere of sexism affected particular hiring and firing decisions is difficult. Meanwhile, there are fears that these sorts of cases will lead companies, fearing lawsuits, to hire fewer women.</p> \n<p>But even when companies ""win"" these lawsuits, they still lose in the court of public opinion. A jury might have ruled that Pao didn't prove her case, but the lawsuit still persuaded a lot of people that Kleiner Perkins has a dysfunctional company culture, which could harm its reputation for years to come.</p> \n<p>So smart managers should be thinking about ways to change their company culture so women never become frustrated enough to file these lawsuits in the first place. One way to do this is with data. By collecting detailed data on their hiring and promotion practices and analyzing it carefully, these companies can better understand where they're falling short on gender equality.</p> \n<h3>Discrimination is hard to prove (especially in court)</h3> \n<p>Sometimes proving discrimination is easy. Pao's case is often compared to the 1982 case of <i>Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins</i>. Ann Hopkins, a Price Waterhouse employee, was denied partnership despite stellar performance. When she asked for feedback, her employer gave her memorable advice: ""Walk more femininely, talk more femininely, dress more femininely, wear makeup and jewelry, have my hair styled,"" as <a href=""http://scholarlycommons.law.hofstra.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1024&amp;context=hlelj"">she later described it.</a></p> \n<p>The firm admitted to giving her this advice, and with that evidence on her side, Hopkins later won the case.</p> \n<p>That kind of smoking gun, as it were, is missing from many gender discrimination cases. One of the most common takeaways people have drawn from the Pao case is that subtle sexism is too hard to prove in courtrooms. That's true, but several of the incidents in the Pao case were anything but subtle.</p> \n<p>One of Pao's coworkers, Trae Vassallo, <a href=""http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/03/30/kleiner-lawsuit-idUSL2N0WT2G420150330"">testified</a> that a male partner came to her hotel room on a business trip in a bathrobe and with a glass of wine one evening. Pao said that her mentor, John Doerr, said she had a ""woman chip on her shoulder."" Women at the firm weren't invited on a ski trip that all of the men went on, nor were they invited to a company dinner because, as one man commented, <a href=""http://thebillfold.com/2015/03/women-kill-the-buzz-sexism-silicon-valley-what-happens-now/"">""women kill the buzz.""</a></p> \n<p>But Pao wasn't able to prove that those instances directly and substantially connected to her lack of promotion.</p> \n<p>""Just the fact that defendants engage in some bias doesn’t establish that it was the cause of plaintiff’s lack of advancement,"" says Deborah Rhode, director of the Center on the Legal Profession at Stanford's law school. ""It's not at the level of intent. No one at Kleiner Perkins said, 'We don't want women at the partnership level.'""</p> \n<p>That said, there were also incidents in Pao's case where reasonable people could disagree about whether sexism was involved, as <a href=""http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2015/03/ellen-pao-and-the-sexism-you-cant-quite-prove.html"">New York Magazine's Annie Lowrey</a> has written. Women were asked to take notes at meetings, and Pao was criticized for having ""sharp elbows,"" which may have been an inadvertent commentary on the distastefulness of a woman having an aggressive personality.</p> \n<p>It's not that the law won't allow juries to award damages because of that subtler sexism, explains one expert.</p> \n<p>""If a plaintiff can show that she lost out on a promotion because of implicit bias, she is entitled to prevail under the formal law. The problem is that it's hard to prove, and judges and jurors are typically looking for more overt proof,"" says Samuel Bagenstos, a professor at the University of Michigan law school.</p> \n<h3>What does work: using data</h3> \n<p>Not only is sexism hard to prove in court, it's also hard to recognize and stop in the workplace. Especially in a male-dominated workplace, it can be easy to perpetuate subtler forms of sexism without even trying. Asking women to take notes may seem innocuous to some men, but it perpetuates ideas of women as filling peripheral, secretarial roles. Interrupting women is another example of this sort of inadvertent sexism, as <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/1/12/7531775/sandberg-women-interrupt-work"">Sheryl Sandberg</a> has written.</p> \n<p>None of this is to say that Pao should have won — Kleiner Perkins made a strong case that Pao was denied a promotion because of performance reviews, and jurors have cited those reviews as playing a key role in their decisions.</p> \n<p>But there is a case to be made that low-grade, chronic sexism can worm its way into performance reviews, and that it may have in the Pao case.</p> \n<p>""There was a fair amount of evidence to suggest that her personality was not a good fit for the firm. But I think you have to ask yourself what about the firm's culture made it a poor fit? And was she judged by a different standard from her male colleagues? And that's where I think her evidence was strong,"" says Rhode. ""John Doerr famously said that she had a female chip on her shoulder, but I think it was the firm's responsibility to ask how it got there. And what about the culture was unwelcoming to women?""</p> \n<p>As the Pao case shows, proving that sort of thing to judges and juries can be difficult. But more important, if a firm — or an entire industry — is truly committed to eliminating sexism, it doesn't want to go before a jury or pay out multimillion-dollar settlements. Undertaking the kind of introspection that Rhode describes will likely be the key. And there's one easy way to spot a lot of it: statistics.</p> \n<p>""One thing you could do, which I am fairly in favor of, is look at, be really aggressive in looking at numbers,"" says Bagenstos. ""You see if there are bottlenecks in the process where the demographics get skewed in one way or another, and those are the places where you say, 'Aha. It looks like something funky is going on here.'""</p> \n<p>Bagenstos adds that judges and legislators tend to have an instinctive ""quota-phobia,"" refusing to put affirmative-action policies into practice. Even absent hard quotas, however, companies should be looking hard at a wide range of metrics to see where they can do better (and if not, why not).</p> \n<p>Some tech companies are already partway there, reporting their gender breakdowns publicly. <a href=""http://www.google.com/diversity/at-google.html#tab=leadership"">Google acknowledges</a> that it's a heavily male, mostly white company: ""We’re not where we want to be when it comes to diversity.""</p> \n<p>But it's not just about hires — it's about pay grades and promotions. Companies should be looking at their numbers to determine whether the women they hire on are rising through the ranks as quickly as the men. <span>And if women are falling behind on a companywide basis, it may be time to ask why that's happening. If enough women's ideas aren't being put into practice, it could be that those women are being silenced in meetings. Much sexism may be subjective, but numbers are an easy and concrete way to start rooting it out.</span></p> \n<p>Google in fact is a model case of this — when the company <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://hbr.org/2014/10/hacking-techs-diversity-problem"">found that women</a> weren't promoted to better jobs as often as men, they discovered that the women weren't good at self-promotion. When the company started encouraging women to nominate themselves for promotion, the women started moving up the ladder.</p> \n<p>To be clear, focusing on the data at Kleiner Perkins may not have gotten Ellen Pao a promotion. And data is only a first step at trying to eliminate sexism. But what data can do is prevent bad patterns from developing. And if enough women are around (particularly in positions of power), it becomes impossible to go on a ski trip without bringing them along.</p>",Business & Finance

The move will raise average wages at McDonald's stores from $9.01 per hour now to $9.90 in July and to more than $10 in 2016, the <a href=""http://www.wsj.com/articles/mcdonalds-to-raise-hourly-pay-for-90-000-workers-1427916364"" target=""_blank"">Wall Street Journal reports</a>.</p> \n<p>The move comes as a slew of other massive, low-wage service-industry employers, most of them in retail, also announce their plans to raise wages. These companies' decisions to raise wages may be important signs that the job market is finally picking up steam and that employers have to compete for workers by offering higher pay.

McDonald's wage announcement is in part about a massive legal battle with consequences for the whole fast food industry,http://www.vox.com/2015/4/2/8335203/mcdonalds-wages-nlrb-joint-employer,"Only 10 percent of McDonald's stores will be affected, and the company wants to keep it that way.","<p>McDonald's <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://news.mcdonalds.com/press-releases/mcdonald-s-usa-announces-new-employee-benefit-package-including-wage-increase-an-nyse-mcd-1185520"">announced Wednesday</a> it was raising the wages for tens of thousands of <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/4/1/8327279/mcdonalds-is-raising-wages"">McDonald's workers</a> nationwide. But the company didn't just announce the feel-good news that it's giving workers higher pay, not to mention paid leave — it also pointed out that its high-profile wage hike will only affect workers at the 10 percent of its stores that are company-owned.</p> \n<p>The company emphasized in its press release that the other 90 percent of stores wouldn't be affected, as <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/4/1/8327279/mcdonalds-is-raising-wages"">Vox reported yesterday</a>: ""The more than 3,100 McDonald's franchisees operate their individual businesses and make their own decisions on pay and benefits for their employees.""</p> \n<p>McDonald's isn't just being open about its business model here; it's making a point that it sees itself as separate from its franchisees. And that makes sense when you understand the legal battle heating up this week at the National Labor Relations Board.</p> \n<p>The very nature of the company's relationship to its workers is in question in that case, and it could have massive implications for franchises nationwide.</p> \n<h3>Is McDonald's an overbearing franchiser?</h3> \n<p>One of the big points of franchising is to create a mutually beneficial relationship: the franchisee benefits from the parent company's brand and well-known products while also getting to make his or her own business decisions. And franchisers, meanwhile, can get more rapid growth and more revenues, without dealing with day-to-day minutiae of managing all these smaller outlets. Meanwhile, both sides give up some measure of control — a franchisee follows franchiser rules about what it serves, for example, while the franchiser gives the franchisee some independence in hiring, firing, and scheduling.</p> \n<p>But the NLRB is trying to decide right now whether McDonald's is more than just a distant parent company to its franchisees. The question is whether McDonald's is a ""joint employer,"" along with its franchisees.</p> \n<p>NLRB hearings began this week that could help determine the answer to this question. <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/12/19/7420729/nlrb-browning-ferris-employer"" style=""font-size: 1.15em; line-height: 1.65; background-color: #ffffff;"">In December</a><span>, the board issued complaints against the company, alleging (among other things) that it retaliated against workers who protested in favor of higher wages. In naming McDonald's as a joint employer, the NLRB's general counsel, Richard Griffin, is essentially arguing that if McDonald's has enough control over its restaurants, it should have to also share in the liability of labor law violations. </span><a href=""http://www.nlrb.gov/news-outreach/fact-sheets/mcdonalds-fact-sheet"" style=""font-size: 1.15em; line-height: 1.65; background-color: #ffffff;"">Griffin</a><span> has also argued for a broader definition of what it means to be a ""joint employer.""</span></p> \n<p>Because of its rules governing day-to-day operations at its restaurants, from the use of scheduling software to bag folding,<a href=""http://www.ibtimes.com/mcdonalds-considered-joint-employer-landmark-national-labor-relations-board-hearings-1862360""> some have argued</a> the company is just as much an employer to its workers as franchisees are.</p> \n<p>And if a franchiser is not a joint employer, under current law, that means it also plays no part in other issues that can happen at the franchisee level — like negotiating with unions or, say, setting the pay of workers.</p> \n<p>As it stands now, the decision to boost pay could put franchisees in a bind, the<a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/02/business/mcdonalds-raising-pay-for-employees.html""> New York Times writes</a>. On the one hand, the franchisees could feel the pressure to raise their own wages. But one anonymous franchisee told the Times that ""business in his restaurants had been 'horrible' and that he did not see how he could increase his employees’ pay.""</p> \n<h3>A fissuring workplace</h3> \n<p>This question of who is a joint employer isn't just about franchisers and franchisees. The question of the increasingly ""fissured workplace"" has become a central one in the US labor market. David Weil, now the administrator of the Wage and Hour Division at the Department of Labor, <a href=""http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674725447"">argued in a 2014 book</a> that as businesses have distanced themselves from workers through means like subcontractors and temp agencies, shrugging off their roles as direct employers, it has led to lower wages, worse benefits, and growing inequality.</p> \n<p>In addition to the McDonald's cases, the NLRB has yet to rule on another high-stakes case involving waste management firm Browning Ferris. The question in this case is whether Browning Ferris is a joint employer and therefore has to negotiate with unionized workers at a subcontractor. In this and the McDonald's case, the broader question of what it means to be an employer is at stake. And as attorney Michael Lotito told me in December, this could have ""cataclysmic"" effects on the nearly 9 million US workers who work in franchises, not to mention the relationship between contractors and subcontractors and even between businesses and their suppliers.</p> \n<p>""It has a way of upsetting these business relationships and employers thinking they were separate suddenly finding they are combined,"" he said.

And until the Fed clarifies its messaging around the relationship between economic recovery and higher interest rates, we are going to be stuck on this see-saw where every multi-month run of good news is swiftly followed by a fallback.</p> \n<p>Elite thirst for a rate hike essentially guarantees that any decent economic run will lead to an immediate runup in the price of the dollar and plentiful concern about medium-term interest rates. Those, in turn, will lead to a joint slowdown in manufacturing and construction. That will pull the recovery back down to earth, and push the timing of the first Fed rate hike out further.</p> \n<p>To achieve liftoff, the Fed needs to say that it <em>wants</em> liftoff.</p> \n<p>And that after a multi-year run of inflation below its 2 percent target rate, it is prepared to keep interest rates low until there is clear and compelling evidence of an inflation problem. That will let investors know that good news is simply good news, and there's no need for every two steps forward to be followed by one step back.</p>",Business & Finance

There's one basic reason it's so slow: when you use it, you're splitting a tiny amount of bandwidth, beamed up from towers on the ground, with dozens of other users on your plane.</p> \n<p>But the good news is that a few airlines — JetBlue and Southwest — offer faster satellite-based alternative services, and Gogo is currently implementing its own, to be rolled out across several airlines over the next couple of years. These services won't equal the speed of networks on the ground, but they just might be worth paying for.</p> \n<h3>Why wifi is painfully slow aboard most flights</h3> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""3581436"" alt=""gogo atg4"" src=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3581436/atg_4_2__1_.0.jpg""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">More than 1,500 planes run on Gogo's ATG (Air-to-Ground) system, which relies on a signal that's sent up from ground towers and received by an antenna on the bottom of the plane.

The top speed is <a href=""http://commercial.gogoair.com/connectivity/technologies/atgatg4"">3.1 megabits per second</a> (Mbps), which by modern standards is extremely slow: it's <a href=""http://www.cnet.com/news/4g-lte-showdown-how-fast-is-your-carrier/"">about a tenth as fast</a> as what you get with a phone on Verizon or AT&amp;T's 4G networks. On about 500 planes, upgraded antennas allow Gogo to run a slightly faster service, called ATG4, but it still only has a top speed of 9.8 Mbps.</p> \n<p>What makes both these services even slower is that this tiny bandwidth is getting divided among dozens or more users.

Though <a href=""http://www.gogoair.com/gogo/listAllProducts.do"">standard Gogo prices</a> are $16 for a full day and $5 for an hour, the company has experimented with surge pricing, charging <a href=""http://pando.com/2012/09/18/stop-sto/"">$10 per hour</a> on Virgin flights from New York to San Francisco, which see a disproportionate number of passengers buy the service.</p> \n<h3>JetBlue and Southwest have faster wifi systems</h3> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3581500/143494703.0.jpg"" alt=""jetblue"" data-chorus-asset-id=""3581500""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">(Allison Joyce/Getty Images)</p> \n<p>Right now, the easiest way to get a faster in-flight wifi connection is to fly Southwest or JetBlue, which use services other than Gogo.</p> \n<p>Southwest's wifi is provided by a company called Row 44. Instead of towers, the signal is sent up from a handful of base stations to a network of geostationary satellites (the same kind used for satellite TV services).

When you send a request to load a webpage, that signal has to travel 22,000 miles or so up to a satellite, and then the actual data has to travel the same distance down.

It'll be a hybrid system: the data downloaded by your computer will come from a satellite network, but the data uploaded will be sent down to the ground-based network.</p> \n<p>Reserving the plane's satellite antenna solely for downloads will boost speeds. And because requests your computer sends out won't have to go all the way up to space and back (they'll get sent directly down to towers on Earth), it'll cut down on latency.</p> \n<p>Gogo claims this GTO will allow for up to 60 or 70 Mbps of download bandwidth. That might be a bit of an exaggeration, but Engadget tested a mock-up version of GTO and <a href=""http://www.engadget.com/2014/06/18/testing-gogo-gto/"">experienced download speeds of 40 Mbps</a>.</p> \n<p><iframe frameborder=""0"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/mHPfLDphoMk?rel=0"" height=""720"" width=""1280""></iframe></p> \n<p>Of course, this would get split among dozens of users throughout the aircraft, so it still won't feel nearly as fast as your wifi network at home.

This simple technology could greatly increase subway capacity at little cost,http://www.vox.com/2015/4/8/8365805/open-gangways,Another example of the high cost of US mass transit isolationism.,"<p>New York City is currently in the process of constructing a $4.5 billion Second Avenue subway line. The project is important: it will deliver  much-needed relief to the overcrowded Lexington Avenue subway line in a city that is utterly dependent on mass transit to move people around.</p> \n<p>But is the <a href=""http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/city-hall/2015/03/8564884/where-transit-build-costs-are-unbelievable"">multibillion-dollar subway line </a>actually necessary? There's a strong case for adding a second subway line to the Upper East Side, but Yonah Freemark points out that in terms of pure congestion relief one could accomplish almost as much by adopting a different form of international best practice — <a href=""http://www.thetransportpolitic.com/2015/04/06/when-american-transit-agencies-ignore-the-worlds-move-to-open-gangways/"">open gangway railcars</a>, a technology that's been standard on foreign systems for over a decade yet is virtually unknown in the United States.</p> \n<h3>The benefits of open gangways</h3> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3578954/Toronto_Rocket_gangway_interior.0.jpg"" data-caption=""Open gangway on the Toronto Rocket"" data-chorus-asset-id=""3578954""></p> \n<p>American metro trains are composed of separate cars that don't directly connect to one another. Consequently, passengers cannot safely move from one car to another without first exiting at a station. By contrast, in an open gangway system the cars are linked in a way that allows riders to safely step from one car to the next.</p> \n<p>This has two main benefits from the standpoint of system capacity:</p> \n<ul> \n<li>Riders can redistribute themselves from crowded cars to uncrowded ones, ensuring that all the available space is used.</li> \n<li>A far greater share of the train's total length is available for passenger use.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>In New York right now, about 9 percent of the length of Lexington Avenue trains is the space between the cars where nobody can ride. The increase in capacity due to improving the rolling stock is almost equal to the 14 percent reduction in crowding promised by the Second Avenue subway. Obviously, building an additional subway line has some advantages beyond congestion — it'll be much more convenient for people who live on Second Avenue or points east — but elsewhere around the country there are many lines that could use more capacity but don't have the population density to support an entirely new parallel tunnel.</p> \n<h3>Open gangways are now standard internationally</h3> \n<p>Of course, simply replacing all the cars in a major metro system would itself be very expensive. Indeed, it would be downright wasteful. But every so often, every city needs to order some new cars. This leads to a slow but steady replacement of older equipment with newer vehicles. And in 75 percent of non-US systems, there are now at least <em>some</em> open gangway trains plying the rails.</p> \n<p>They are in brand new systems in China and very old systems in Germany. They are everywhere. Because the overall replacement process is slow, it's easy to miss how widespread open gangways have become as a procurement priority. But it's fair to say that they have become the standard in new mass transit railcars.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, in the United States, they are used in Honolulu and ... nowhere else. And no cities have plans to introduce them.</p> \n<h3>America's costly transit isolationism</h3> \n<p>Freemark runs through various technical objections to the use of open gangway cars in the United States and finds them wanting. If this were a single example, it would be tempting to give American transit operators the benefit of the doubt and assume they must have <em>some</em> good reason for rejecting this technology. But the truth is that it's just a small part of a wider and troubling trend of mass transit isolationism.</p> \n<p>Everyone knows European cities have, in general, superior mass transit to American ones.</p> \n<p>But American agencies are remarkably resistant to the idea that they should try to adopt some best operational practices from abroad. <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/3/31/5563600/everything-you-need-to-know-about-boarding-an-amtrak-train"">Amtrak has passengers board trains in a bizarre manner</a>, <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/7/25/5937215/dc-streetcar-disaster-mixed-traffic-streetcars-are-evil"">America builds brand new mixed-traffic streetcars</a> that are universally rejected abroad, and America rarely uses <a href=""http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2013/06/11/proof_of_payment_for_mass_transit_the_best_way.html"">proof-of-payment</a> fare-collection systems.</p> \n<p>It's understandable that the United States, which is very large, tends to be somewhat insular across a wide range of topics.

Or if Germany can't think of anything worth spending money on, it should enact a large cut in its national sales tax. How to pay for it? Easy.</p> \n<p>Don't. Because the weirdest story in the economics world just keeps getting weirder.</p> \n<p> \n<script src=""//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"" charset=""utf-8""></script> \n</p> \n<blockquote class=""twitter-tweet"" lang=""en""> \n<p>German 10-year bond yield to go negative, says Citi. Targets -0.05%, vs current record low 0.15%.</p> \n— Jamie McGeever (@ReutersJamie) <a href=""https://twitter.com/ReutersJamie/status/586275279309565953"">April 9, 2015</a>\n</blockquote> \n<h3>European governments are being offered free money</h3> \n<p>Right now on the European continent there are several countries, including Germany and Finland, that have sold bonds that pay negative interest rates. In other words, you give the Finnish government 1,000 euros today and several years later they give you back fewer than 1,000 euros.</p> \n<p>This is an extraordinary event, the impact of which has been somewhat blunted by the fact that for years now some government bonds have traded at negative <i>real</i> rates.</p> \n<p>That means the rate of interest charged is less than the projected rate of inflation, giving governments the opportunity to essentially borrow for free. That's an unusual situation, but it's always been clearly something that might happen every so often. What's playing out right now where some governments are selling bonds at negative nominal rates — and a much larger group including Netherlands, Sweden, Denmark, Switzerland, and Austria have seen bonds trade at negative rates in the secondary market — is considerably weirder.</p> \n<p>Indeed, the interest rate situation in Europe is so strange that until quite recently, it was thought to be entirely impossible. There was a lot of economic theory built around the problem of the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_lower_bound"" sl-processed=""1"">Zero Lower Bound</a> — the impossibility of sustained negative interest rates. Some economists wanted to <a href=""http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/technology/2011/12/how_eliminating_paper_money_could_end_recessions_.html"" sl-processed=""1"">eliminate paper money</a> to eliminate the lower bound problem. Paul Krugman wrote a lot of columns about it. One of them said, ""The zero lower bound isn't a theory, it's a fact, and it's a fact that we've been facing for five years now.""</p> \n<h3>Why did economists think negative interest rates were impossible?</h3> \n<p>Well, think about it. A bond with a negative interest rate is a guaranteed money-loser. Why would you buy one if you can just hold cash instead?</p> \n<p>The traditional view has always been that no one would. People thought the interest rate on bonds couldn't fall below zero because at that point people will just hold on to their money.</p> \n<h3>So why are negative interest rates happening?</h3> \n<p>Well, back in January<span> the Eurozone's central bank </span><a style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.65;"" sl-processed=""1"" href=""http://www.bbc.com/news/business-30933515"">launched a program of quantitative easing</a><span> — in other words, printing money and using it to buy government bonds. This was supposed to reduce interest rates, and it's working. </span></p> \n<p>But here's the catch. The Eurozone has one central bank — the European Central Bank — but there's no consolidated Eurozone debt, no ""eurobonds.""</p> \n<p>So when the ECB goes out and buys bonds, it needs to buy the bonds of its member states — a little Belgium, a dollop of Portugal, a smattering of Finland, a dose of Italy, etc. But one consequence of the <a sl-processed=""1"" href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/eurozone-crisis/what-is-the-eurozone"">Eurozone crisis of 2010–2011</a> is that people think the Eurozone might break up. If the Eurozone does break up, you're going to be way better off owning the debt of a rich and stable country like Germany than the debt of a country like Spain that's much poorer and facing an <a sl-processed=""1"" href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/eurozone-crisis/podemos-spain"">uncertain political situation</a>. So whatever the interest rate on Spanish bonds, the rate on German bonds is sure to be lower.</p> \n<p>In other words, if the ECB takes steps to make Spanish interest rates really low, then the interest rate on more creditworthy Eurozone countries has to go below zero.</p> \n<h3>But why would anyone buy a negative-interest bond?</h3> \n<p>That is the real mystery. The mechanics of pushing interest rates down are easy to see. <span>But why not just hold cash in your bank account? It's not entirely clear what's happening, but here are three major motivations that market insiders say are in play:</span></p> \n<ul> \n<li>Safety: A bond is backed by the full faith and credit of the government that issues it. Bank accounts are only government-guaranteed up to a certain extent — most European countries cover 100,000 euros. Very rich people and big companies have more money than that and need to do something with it. Obviously you could fill shoeboxes with paper money, but there are safety risks with that, too.</li> \n<li>Passive funds: Because people thought negative interest rates were impossible, few institutions have rules in place that were designed to accommodate this situation. Pension funds, mutual funds, and other impersonal investment vehicles have rules and formulae they're supposed to be following. To the extent that those rules call for the holding of safe bonds, some bond buying can simply happen on autopilot.</li> \n<li>Banks: Banks can't store their spare money in a bank account. Instead, they store reserves with a government-run central bank. A certain amount of reserves are required by regulators. But banks can also store ""excess"" reserves. The European Central Bank is currently <a sl-processed=""1"" href=""http://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/key/date/2014/html/sp140909.en.html"">charging a fee on excess reserves</a>, which means it makes more sense to park excess cash in government bonds.</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>This is interesting, but what's the takeaway?</h3> \n<p>The main practical short-term takeaway is that Germany (and other smaller creditworthy European nations) is hurting both itself and the world economy by declining to run a larger budget deficit. As Ben Bernanke explained in a recent blog post, <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.brookings.edu/blogs/ben-bernanke/posts/2015/04/03-germany-trade-surplus-problem"">Germany's huge trade surplus</a> is a problem for the global economy because it means Germans aren't buying enough stuff to create job opportunities for non-Germans.</p> \n<p>When German politicians hear their surplus criticized, they typically become defensive and say it's absurd to blame them for manufacturing great products that the world wants to buy. But the issue isn't what Germany sells to the world, it's how little Germany <i>buys</i>.</p> \n<p>What's more, fixing the problem requires absolutely zero sacrifice on Germany's part. What the world needs from Berlin is for Germany to buy itself a bunch of nice shiny new transportation and energy infrastructure, or else for Germany to give itself a huge tax cut. Not only would shiny new projects and lower taxes be fun, but the message of the negative interest rates story is that by borrowing more money <i>today</i> Germany will improve its long-term fiscal situation.</p> \n<h3>What are the implications for the United States?</h3> \n<p>For the USA, the main implication is that back in 2009 and 2010 the Federal Reserve made a mistake. All the objective economic metrics at the time said the ""right"" interest rate to curb unemployment would be negative. But negative interest rates are impossible! The Fed tried a few tricks to get around that problem, and also told Congress to try fiscal stimulus as a workaround.</p> \n<p>The implication of the European experience, however, is that the Fed could have generated negative interest rates through a mix of Quantitative Easing and negative interest rates.</p>",Business & Finance
The button: the fascinating social experiment driving Reddit crazy,http://www.vox.com/2015/4/10/8383165/reddit-button-explained,"More than 700,000 people have pushed the button. Here's why.","<p>The button began its life as an April Fools' joke, but nearly two weeks later the community surrounding the Reddit social experiment is still going strong. On Friday morning, the community reached a new milestone, as users started earning coveted yellow flair.</p> \n<p>The previous sentence probably didn't make much sense to you. To explain it, we have to start at the beginning. I promise it'll be interesting.</p> \n<h3>What is the button?</h3> \n<p>The button is a feature that the popular social media site Reddit introduced on April 1, 2015. It has its own subreddit at <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/thebutton/"">/r/thebutton</a>.</p> \n<p>The button looks like this:</p> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""3591892"" alt=""button.0.gif"" src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3591892/button.0.gif""></p> \n<p><span>The actual button is on the left. At the right is a counter, which starts at 60 seconds and counts down to zero. Every time a redditor pushes the button, the counter resets to 60 seconds and begins counting down again.</span></p> \n<p>Only people who had Reddit accounts before April 1 are allowed to push the button. And each user only gets to push the button once.</p> \n<h3>What happens when the timer reaches zero?</h3> \n<p>No one (outside of Reddit staff) knows, because it's never happened. As I'm writing this on Tuesday afternoon, it's been pressed by more than 730,000 people. Because of the combined efforts of these people, the timer has never gotten below 27 seconds.</p> \n<h3>What's so interesting about this button that more than 700,000 people have wanted to press it?</h3> \n<p>The button is powered by two of the most powerful forces in human societies: status competition and boredom.</p> \n<p>When users post messages on the /r/thebutton subreddit, a colored badge (called ""flair"" in Reddit-land) shows whether the user has pressed the button and if so, what time the counter showed at the time that user pressed it. If you've never pressed the button, you get a gray ""non-presser"" badge that looks like this:</p> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""3591914"" alt=""nonpresser.0.png"" src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3591914/nonpresser.0.png""></p> \n<p>People who have pressed the button get a flair that looks like this:</p> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""3591916"" alt=""Screen_Shot_2015-04-10_at_11.54.11_AM.0.png"" src=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3591916/Screen_Shot_2015-04-10_at_11.54.11_AM.0.png""></p> \n<p>The color indicates how much time was left when you pressed the button — this user pushed the button at 31 seconds and has a coveted yellow badge as a result. If you were impatient and pressed the button with more than 52 seconds left, you get lame purple flair. People who pressed between 42 and 51 seconds get blue flair; 32 to 41 seconds gets green. You can only press the button once, so once you get a badge you're stuck with it for life.</p> \n<p>These colored badges have created a virtual status hierarchy. Within the /r/thebutton community, lower numbers are more prestigious. Only a few people have had the patience and good luck to snag coveted yellow flair indicating a timer below 31 seconds. There are also believed to be orange and red flair for when the timer gets below 21 and 11 seconds, respectively, but no one has actually gotten this flair yet.</p> \n<p>As I write this, there are a bunch of Reddit users wasting time on /r/thebutton in hopes of joining this elite group.</p> \n<h3>How rare are the lowest numbers?</h3> \n<p>You can see statistics about how many /r/thebutton posters have achieved each level <a href=""http://button.cstevens.me/flairs"">here</a>. Tens of thousands of lazy people have earned purple flair for times over 52 seconds. Thousands have earned blue or green flair for times between 32 and 51 seconds.</p> \n<p>Only a few hundred posters have earned yellow flair, including 38 who pushed the button at 29 seconds, 9 who pushed it at 28 seconds, and just 3 who pushed at 27 seconds. (The actual number of button-pressers is higher for most of these categories, since only those who post a message on the site are counted.)</p> \n<h3>What happens on the /r/thebutton subreddit?</h3> \n<p>It's basically a place where people can brag about their low numbers and look down on people unfortunate enough to have higher ones. This being Reddit, people post silly pictures to illustrate how they're feeling about the competition. For example, when the first yellow flair started to show up, someone with a yellow badge posted this GIF under the title <a style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.65;"" href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/thebutton/comments/323k94/how_i_feel_right_now/"" target=""_blank"">""How I feel right now""</a>:</p> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""3591926"" alt=""PF09Fnb.0.gif"" src=""https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3591926/PF09Fnb.0.gif""></p> \n<p>People also post GIFs like <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/thebutton/comments/32253v/i_saw_the_timer_get_lower_than_ive_ever_seen/"" target=""_blank"">this one</a> to express the frustration of having another user press the button right before they were going to:</p> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""3591934"" alt=""oJG3B.0.gif"" src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3591934/oJG3B.0.gif""></p> \n<h3>Have you pushed the button?</h3> \n<p>I thought you'd never ask. I pushed the button on Saturday morning at a time of 31 seconds, earning me some coveted yellow flair:</p> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3594244/Screen_Shot_2015-04-11_at_8.58.20_AM.0.png"" alt=""Screen_Shot_2015-04-11_at_8.58.20_AM.0.png"" data-chorus-asset-id=""3594244""></p> \n<p>When I originally posted this story on Friday afternoon, I hadn't pushed the button yet, because getting yellow flair was too difficult. I captured about an hour of button press data around lunchtime on Friday (you can create your own chart <a href=""http://jamesrom.github.io/"">here</a>), and it looked like this:</p> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""3591940"" alt=""button_presses.0.png"" src=""https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3591940/button_presses.0.png""></p> \n<p>You can see the problem: when the timer got into the 40s, someone almost always got greedy and pushed the button. The lower the timer got, the greater the temptation became to push it. As a result, the button only occasionally made it into green territory (32 to 41) and never fell into yellow territory below 31.</p> \n<p>But my patience was rewarded. When I looked again around 8 am Eastern Time on Saturday, there were fewer people on the page, and so yellows were more common, allowing me to snag one.</p> \n<p>If you want to get yellow (or even better, orange or red) flair, the key is to do it between 5 and 8 am Eastern Time (2 to 5 am Pacific). That seems to be the time when the fewest people are paying attention, so your odds of getting a low number are at their highest.</p> \n<h3>What's the future of the button?</h3> \n<p>As the experiment went on and interest in the button flagged, the timer's value got lower and people <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://button.cstevens.me/times"">set new records</a>. Someone first earned blue flair for a 51-second time on April 3, and green flair started showing up on April 4. People only started getting yellow flair on Friday.</p> \n<p>But this week a surge of media interest has caused more people to visit the site. This chart, <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/thebutton/comments/32jzhx/4_days_were_lost_to_the_recent_media_attention/"">created by Reddit user Dendrimer14</a>, shows the average rate of button presses between April 3 and April 14:</p> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3605550/IwRrGDU.0.png"" alt=""IwRrGDU.0.png"" data-chorus-asset-id=""3605550""></p> \n<p>This shows that in the last couple of days, media attention has driven more people to the site, which has caused the button to be pushed more frequently. As a result, there have been no new records set since Sunday morning's record of 27 seconds.</p> \n<p>This can't last forever, though. Sooner or later, interest will dwindle to the point where people can earn orange and then red flair, and then finally the timer might run out altogether. Estimates on how long this will take range from a few more days to many months.</p> \n<h3>Watch: The best virtual reality game at GDC 15</h3> \n<!-- CHORUS_VIDEO_EMBED ChorusVideo:66336 -->",Business & Finance
Las Vegas and the coming gamblification of American pro sports,http://www.vox.com/2015/4/14/8411035/sports-gambling-betting-las-vegas,T-shirt guns. Kiss cams. Mascot races. In-seat betting?,"<p>Someday soon, you might be able to attend an NHL or NBA game in Las Vegas — and bet on the outcome from the comfort of your stadium seat.</p> \n<p>After years as one of the country's largest metro areas without a pro team, Las Vegas is <a href=""http://www.reviewjournal.com/business/arena-builder-takes-shot-landing-nba-las-vegas"">building a new arena</a> and is <a href=""http://www.tsn.ca/nhl-approves-opening-expansion-process-1.316896"" target=""_blank"">viewed as the favorite</a> to get the NHL's upcoming expansion team. But whether it's the NHL or another league that makes the jump, the move to Vegas would be part of a clear trend: gambling is become more and more acceptable in American culture.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""right"">""there's an enormous revenue source to tap into""</q></p> \n<p>Leagues are already promoting forms of pseudo-gambling that encourage viewership, such as <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/8/15/6003131/fantasy-football-how-to-play-draft-rankings"">fantasy sports</a> and <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/3/16/8214573/march-madness-2015-ncaa-bracket"">NCAA brackets</a>. On-site gambling could be the next step. ""The leagues recognize that there's an enormous revenue source to tap into if they can figure out a way to allow on-site betting,"" says <a href=""http://economics.umbc.edu/dennis-coates/"">Dennis Coates</a>, a professor of economics at the University of Maryland who studies sports business. ""I think it can be done, and eventually it will be done.""</p> \n<p>If Coates and other experts are right, it's very likely that on-site betting will happen first in Las Vegas — and that the NHL's possible move to that city could be the first stage of a much bigger shift in American sports.</p> \n<h3>Pro sports leagues have long been terrified of Vegas</h3> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""3604164"" alt=""black sox scandal"" src=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3604164/Eight_men_banned.0.png""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">The 1919 <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Sox_Scandal"" target=""_blank"">Black Sox Scandal</a> scared sports leagues away from Vegas for decades. (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Eight_men_banned.png"">Underwood &amp; Underwood</a>)</p> \n<p>Leagues have historically avoided Las Vegas for two main reasons. Until recently, it wasn't a particularly large metro area by population. Now, however, it <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Metropolitan_Statistical_Areas"">ranks 30th</a> — and is bigger than 12 areas (including Salt Lake City, Raleigh, and Buffalo) that do have pro teams.</p> \n<p>The other factor, though, has been the simple fact that Nevada law allows gambling on sports.</p> \n<p>The worry is that the proximity of gambling would lead to match fixing, in which people with a stake in the outcome pay players to lose on purpose — like in 1919, when eight players on the Chicago White Sox were allegedly <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Sox_Scandal"">paid to lose the World Series</a>. This episode led Major League Baseball to take the strongest stance against gambling of all the major sports: Pete Rose, for instance, was <a href=""http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/espn25/story?page=moments/5"">banned from baseball for life</a> for betting on games while he was the manager of the Cincinnati Reds.</p> \n<div class=""align-right"">\n<img src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3604178/1395841.0.jpg"" alt=""unlv basketball"" data-chorus-asset-id=""3604178""> \n<p class=""caption"">(Getty Images/Ken Levine)</p> \n</div> \n<p>There's also some reason to believe that Las Vegas in particular presents temptations. The closest thing the city has ever had to a pro team is UNLV's Running Rebels, who won the 1990 NCAA basketball championship and lost in the final the next year. But shortly afterward, the team was <a href=""http://articles.latimes.com/1992-02-14/sports/sp-2218_1_unlv-president-robert-maxson"">investigated for point shaving</a> (intentionally scoring or allowing certain numbers of points, depending on bettors' <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spread_betting"">point spread</a>). The NCAA never uncovered any evidence, but for many, the rumors <a href=""http://sports.espn.go.com/ncb/tournament/2010/columns/story?id=5045144"">tarnished the team's legacy</a>.</p> \n<p>In 1992, lobbying by leaders of all major leagues led Congress to <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_and_Amateur_Sports_Protection_Act_of_1992"">pass a law</a> that prohibited gambling on sports anywhere that it hadn't already been legalized — banning it virtually everywhere besides Nevada. They argued that such a law was necessary to ensure the legitimacy of their sports.</p> \n<h3>But gambling has permeated American culture</h3> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""3604204"" alt=""slot machines"" src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3604204/464766738.0.jpg""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">(John Greim/LightRocket via Getty Images)</p> \n<p>""Times have changed,"" NBA commissioner Adam Silver wrote in a <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/14/opinion/nba-commissioner-adam-silver-legalize-sports-betting.html"">landmark New York Times op-ed</a> last year. ""Congress should adopt a federal framework that allows states to authorize betting on professional sports.""</p> \n<p>In his argument, Silver cited several key cultural trends: the proliferation of legal casinos and lotteries across the country, the ease of gambling on sports in other countries like Britain (where you can bet on games on your phone), and the huge amount of money (estimated to be <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/sports-gambling-in-us-too-prevalent-to-remain-illegal/2015/02/27/f1088e4c-b7d3-11e4-9423-f3d0a1ec335c_story.html"">somewhere between $80 and $380 billion </a>annually) that's illegally wagered with offshore bookmaking operations by American sports fans.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""right"">""times have changed,"" wrote NBA commissioner adam silver</q></p> \n<p>But Silver left out a few trends, too. ""It's not just the offshore, illegal sort of gambling,"" Dennis Coates says. ""It's things like FanDuel.com."" The ""daily fantasy sports"" site, not technically considered gambling, allows users to effectively bet on individual players' statistics in each game, and <a href=""https://www.fanduel.com/investors"">took in some $57 million in net revenues</a> in 2014 — the same year the NBA bought a stake in the company.</p> \n<p>Silver and the leaders of other leagues know that both illegal betting and the <a href=""http://www.vox.com/xpress/2014/8/28/6078573/fantasy-sports-football-revenue"">surging fantasy sports industry</a> help them by giving lots of people reasons to watch games. But they likely want more — a piece of the gambling pie for themselves. ""I'm sure that somewhere in their minds, they're thinking, 'Since we're providing the basis for the gambling, we ought to be able to generate some payment,'"" says <a href=""https://www.lakeforest.edu/academics/faculty/baade/"">Robert Baade</a>, a sports business professor at Lake Forest College.</p> \n<h3>How sports leagues might someday profit from gambling</h3> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""3604216"" alt=""britain soccer gambling "" src=""https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3604216/460838658.0.jpg""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">In Britain, you can place bets at soccer stadiums. (Nigel Roddis/Getty Images)</p> \n<p>The leagues could pursue two different strategies in this area.

The other, easier route would be to put a team in Vegas. ""As teams move around and leagues expand, Las Vegas keeps entering the conversation,"" Baade says.</p> \n<p>Though the NHL seems like to expand to Las Vegas, there are <a href=""http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/half-of-the-nhls-rumored-expansion-cities-dont-make-sense/"">very good reasons to wonder</a> whether the desert city has enough hockey fans to support a team. At other times, it's seemed more likely that the NBA would move there first.</p> \n<p>For either league, though, Baade thinks on-site gambling would eventually be part of the plan: ""In the competition between stadiums and watching games at home, television quality continues to improve, and stadiums need to keep up,"" he says. This competition has led to things like T-shirt guns, mascot races, and the kiss cam. ""I have a hunch that in the future, they're going to offer some sort of in-seat gambling opportunities,"" he says.</p> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""3604230"" alt=""vegas arena"" src=""https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3604230/renderings-ext-05.0.jpg""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">A rendering of the Las Vegas Arena.

In 2007, for instance, NBA referee Tim Donaghy was sent to prison after <a href=""http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/columns/story?columnist=munson_lester&amp;id=2976241&amp;campaign=rss&amp;source=NBAHeadlines"">selling inside information to professional gamblers</a> — and perhaps affecting the outcome of games.</p> \n<p>Adam Silver, the NBA commissioner, <a href=""http://espn.go.com/chalk/story/_/id/12262502/gambling-issue-adam-silver-wants-sports-gambling-legalized-other-leagues-join-him"">says he supports legalizing gambling</a> because it'll make this sort of illegal activity — which often leads to unusual betting patterns —  easier to track and prevent. But the hard truth is that the more money that flows into gambling, the greater the temptation for players, coaches, or referees to fix games.</p> \n<p>""It's a dicey proposition,"" Baade says.

Scientists created a self-powered camera,http://www.vox.com/2015/4/15/8414227/camera-self-powered,It powers itself with the light that hits its lens.,"<p>Digital cameras and solar panels have more in common than you might realize. At their core, both convert light into electric current — it's just that a camera does so to measure light's intensity, and a solar panel does it to create usable power.</p> \n<p>A group of Columbia University engineers recently took advantage of this similarity to create something pretty cool: a camera that powers itself.</p> \n<p>The camera, which is made from off-the-shelf parts and <a href=""http://www.eurekalert.org/emb_releases/2015-04/cuso-act041315.php"">will be presented next week</a> at the International Conference on Computational Photography, doesn't take especially sharp pictures. Instead, it's intended as a proof of concept:</p> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3605142/camera.0.gif"" alt=""camera gif"" data-chorus-asset-id=""3605142""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">A short video made from photos taken by the self-powered camera. (<a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.eurekalert.org/multimedia/pub/89962.php"">Computer Vision Laboratory, Columbia Engineering</a>)</p> \n<p>What makes the camera special is its image sensor. Normally, this component senses the intensity of the light hitting the lens with millions of <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photodiode"">photodiodes</a> — semiconductors that convert light into electric current, which gets encoded as digital data.</p> \n<p>But in this camera, the photodiodes cycle back and forth between the image-taking mode and an energy-harvesting mode, in which the current instead charges the battery. This means that if the camera is in a bright area, it can continuously take a photo every second, indefinitely, without ever needing an external charge. The scientists claim it's the first camera that's fully self-powered.</p> \n<p>Eventually, this sort of technology could be used in what's called the <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/5/8/5590228/how-tiny-computers-could-change-the-way-we-live"" target=""_blank"">""Internet of Things""</a>: the growing network of ubiquitous wifi-connected devices like <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/2/18/8062387/smart-thermostat-good-investment"">smart thermostats</a>, locks, and light bulbs.</p> \n<p>A cheap, small camera that can be left on indefinitely could have all sorts of uses.

What we can learn from the CEO who took a 93% pay cut to give his team a raise,http://www.vox.com/2015/4/15/8420203/dan-price,There's a lesson for us all in this.,"<p>People love the story of Dan Price, the CEO of Gravity Payments in Seattle, <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/14/business/owner-of-gravity-payments-a-credit-card-processor-is-setting-a-new-minimum-wage-70000-a-year.html?smprod=nytcore-iphone&amp;smid=nytcore-iphone-share&amp;_r=0"">who cut his $1 million annual salary to $70,000</a> and raised the salaries of his lowest-paid employees up to a $70,000 floor. Price says he was inspired to make the move after reading that more money leads to more happiness, but only up to the point of $70,000 a year or so.</p> \n<p>The original New York Times report quotes Price saying, ""Is anyone else freaking out right now. I'm kind of freaking out,"" right after making the announcement. It's a wonderful story, and Price deserves the plaudits he's receiving.</p> \n<p>Unfortunately, the big questions raised by the story have a couple of not-so-feel-good answers. But Price is getting something important right: a more equal world is going to be a happier world.</p> \n<h3>What if every CEO did this?</h3> \n<p>The most natural question is to wonder what would happen if more CEOs acted this way. After all, though $1 million is a lot of money, it's far from the top of the executive compensation sweepstakes in America. But as <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/8/6/5970815/what-if-walmarts-ceo-took-a-pay-cut-for-his-workers"">Danielle Kurtzleben pointed out last year</a>, it turns out that the executive compensation packages of really big companies' CEOs don't actually go that far when stretched across huge enterprises.</p> \n<p>Walmart chief Douglas McMillan, for example, <a href=""http://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/people/person.asp?personId=21958514&amp;ticker=WMT"">pulled in $25 million in 2014</a>. That's a ton of money. But Walmart has about a million hourly employees, meaning that a drastic pay cut for McMillan would only finance a very modest bonus for the entire team. If McMillan cut his salary to $70,000, for instance, he would only be able to give each of his employees a raise of not quite $25.</p> \n<p>Walmart is, obviously, an extreme case. But the huge divergence in what Price can achieve with a pay cut and what the much-better-paid McMillan can achieve with a pay cut goes to show that the math of this kind of enterprise is heavily dependent on the size of the company. For smallish companies, what the boss pays himself really is the key to what he has left to pay his workers. Big companies have much more complicated pay structures. Compressing the salary distribution up and down the line at Walmart could certainly raise pay for rank-and-file associates considerably, but it would mean forcing not just one boss but hundreds of highly paid subordinates to take pay cuts.</p> \n<h3>The research that inspired Price is probably wrong</h3> \n<p>Even worse, Price's reading of the happiness literature is likely mistaken. <span>He appears to have been </span><a href=""http://www.pnas.org/content/107/38/16489.full"" style=""font-size: 1.15em; line-height: 1.65; background-color: #ffffff;"">relying on a paper by Daniel Kahneman and Angus Deaton</a><span>. </span><span>But subsequent analysis by </span><a href=""http://www.brookings.edu/research/papers/2013/04/subjective-well-being-income"" style=""font-size: 1.15em; line-height: 1.65; background-color: #ffffff;"">Betsey Stevenson and Justin Wolfers disputes this</a><span>,</span><span> and finds that the reason you see rich people trying to amass even more money is that there is no satiation point. So $70,000 is better than $25,000, but $7 million is even better. </span></p> \n<p><span>Here's a chart summarizing their findings:</span></p> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""3607274"" src=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3607274/wolferscharts02.0.jpg""></p> \n<p>Across countries, life satisfaction increases with the log of household income. In other words, it's true that if you're already pretty affluent, a <em>little</em> money won't make you much more content. But that doesn't mean money is useless — it just means you need a <em>lot</em> more.</p> \n<h3>Redistribution increases well-being</h3> \n<p>That point about how much money you need to become happier cuts both ways, though. What it says is that the well-being Price would lose by dropping from $1,000,000 a year to $980,000 a year is smaller than the well-being gained by a rank-and-file employee going from $50,000 a year to $70,000 a year. Which is to say that redistributing income from the haves to the have-nots makes the world a happier place.</p> \n<p>In a corporate setting, that means a small raise to low-paid workers will accomplish more than a medium raise to workers who are already well-paid. In a political setting, it means that taxing the rich to finance tax credits or health insurance for the poor and the working class will make for a happier country.</p> \n<b>WATCH: 'The dangers of wealth inequality for America'</b> \n<!-- CHORUS_VIDEO_EMBED ChorusVideo:45127 -->",Business & Finance

Ordinarily, this would have pushed up the value of China's currency, the yuan, relative to the US dollar. That, in turn, would have made Chinese goods more expensive in the US and hampered the growth of Chinese exports. The Chinese government decided it didn't want to let that happen, so it needed to cycle export earnings back into something else priced in dollars.</p> \n<p>China chose to buy lots of federal debt — and also lots of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac debt that was guaranteed by the federal government — because it's very safe and also very easy to buy in large quantities.</p> \n<h3>Japan's version of Social Security is diversifying</h3> \n<p>Whatever its origins, the China bond surge is clearly over as China has moved on to a new era of slower growth and somewhat different political thinking about its desired path of development. In its place has come a rush of Japanese money. This money is coming from the Government Pension Investment Fund, which is kind of like Japan's equivalent of our Social Security Trust Fund.</p> \n<p>The difference is that America's Social Security Trust Fund invests (or ""invests"") exclusively in US government debt, which makes it functionally equivalent to an accounting device rather than a proper trust fund.</p> \n<p>Japan's GPIF, however, moved away from that model a few years back in favor of acting more like a real sovereign wealth fund, of the sort you see in Norway and the Gulf states. Over the past 12 months, that's generated a lot of stories about GPIF <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/8114ec60-60ef-11e4-894b-00144feabdc0.html#axzz3XSjYckaf"">buying</a> foreign <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/02/27/japan-gpif-idUSL4N0W132J20150227"">stocks</a>. But before it dove all the way into the stock market, it tested the waters with the relatively safe move of buying US Treasury bonds.</p> \n<p>The point of all this is that <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2015/01/01/374382369/japans-population-declined-in-2014-as-births-fell-to-a-new-low"">Japan's population is declining</a>, which means Japan's retirees can't necessarily count on the next generation of Japanese people to produce enough income to support them all. Japan needs to look outside its borders to more demographically vibrant countries to find the investment opportunities it needs.</p> \n<h3>The US government doesn't need to borrow money</h3> \n<p>All this points to the awkward truth about America's national debt — the federal government has no need to borrow money. If you want to buy a house, you probably need to borrow some cash to afford it. Lots of businesses face the same problem. So do towns, states, school districts, and other public agencies all around the country. But the US government <i>makes US dollars out of thin air</i> and thus can never be in a position where it needs to borrow some US dollars from someone else.</p> \n<p>The reason the government finances deficits by selling bonds rather than printing dollars is because <i>other people like to buy the bonds</i>.</p> \n<p>For some, like the Chinese government, buying a bunch of US government bonds is the most convenient way to gain exposure to the overall value of the US dollar. For others, like the Japanese government, buying a bunch of US government bonds is a safe and predictable store of value in a world where some countries are facing severe demographic or geopolitical risks. Many bond buyers, of course, are private individuals or companies who also have these motives.</p> \n<p>The point, however, is that nobody can ""threaten"" the United States by refusing to buy our federal government's debt. The debt is there because people want to buy it. If nobody wanted it, there would be a <i>logistical</i> challenge in switching from debt finance to money finance — either Congress or the Federal Reserve would have to promulgate a new policy — but economically speaking, life would go on as before.</p>",Business & Finance
Why airlines should charge for every bag you bring onboard,http://www.vox.com/2015/4/16/8431465/airlines-carry-on-bags,It slows us down â€” and burns extra fuel.,"<p><span>Most US carriers charge you if you want to check a bag, but not if you carry one on.

Bag fees lower the base cost of tickets, giving people the option of packing lighter if they want to save money. They're also fair, given that fuel is a big part of the operating cost of airlines.</p> \n<p>Instead, a better solution would be to charge passengers based on the weight of all the bags we carry aboard: our checked bags and our carry-ons.</p> \n<h3>The airlines' convoluted approach to luggage</h3> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3614398/461227845.0.jpg"" alt=""luggage 2"" data-chorus-asset-id=""3614398""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">(Chris Seward/Raleigh News &amp; Observer/MCT via Getty Images)</p> \n<p>Starting in 2008, largely in response to rising costs for fuel, most US airlines (excluding Southwest and JetBlue) <a href=""http://www.farecompare.com/travel-advice/airline-fees-bags-history/"">began charging for checked bags</a>. Perhaps in response to the backlash from passengers, however, most airlines still allowed people to bring carry-on bags for free (though Spirit Airlines charges for those, too). And for whatever reason, most will allow you to check bags right as you get on the plane for free, as well.</p> \n<p>People respond to incentives, and this convoluted structure sets up some perverse ones. It means everyone has good reason to bring as many bags through security as possible, slowing down security lines. It's the reason there's a scramble for overhead-bin room during every relatively full flight. And it means that getting on and off the plane takes longer, because virtually every passenger is storing a bag in the overhead bins.</p> \n<p>Engineers have devised a <a href=""http://science.howstuffworks.com/transport/flight/modern/baggage-handling.htm"">system</a> for getting our bags into and out of the cargo holds of planes quickly, using codes, scanners, conveyor belts, vehicles, and people whose job is entirely focused on handling baggage. Yes, bags get lost sometimes. But the two-tiered charging structure means that instead of using this system, we're cramming a whole lot of luggage through a parallel system meant to put people on planes, causing all sorts of inefficiencies and delays.</p> \n<h3>Charging for all bags is fair — and will save fuel</h3> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3614406/488934439.0.jpg"" alt=""overhead bins"" data-chorus-asset-id=""3614406""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">(Robert Nickelsberg/Getty Images)</p> \n<p>The underlying logic behind charging for checked bags, though, is sound. Though the cost of fuel has gone down in recent years, somewhere between <a href=""http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303296604577450581396602106"">20 to 30 percent</a> of the cost of your ticket still goes toward fuel costs. And the more weight you bring aboard, the more fuel gets burned during the flight.</p> \n<p>Paying for that fuel makes sense — and not just for the ideal of fairness. It has real effects.</p> \n<p>In recent years, airlines have cut down on weight as much as possible, eliminating drink carts for trays carried by flight attendants, for instance. ""I’ve sat in on airline fuel committee monthly meetings to discuss how we could reduce the weight on each aircraft in a fleet by a single pound,"" Andrew Kemmetmueller, the CEO of a company that's worked to replace heavy pilot flight manuals with iPads, <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/09/business/airlines-weigh-costs-and-passenger-pounds-on-the-road.html"">told the New York Times</a>.

"If the EU wins its case against Google, it could change the search engine forever",http://www.vox.com/2015/4/16/8433153/eu-google-antitrust,"European regulators say it's illegal to promote Google Shopping in search results, but Google does the same thing for maps, images, and news.","<p>The European Union's competition commissioner filed a <a href=""http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-15-4781_en.htm"">""statement of objections""</a> on Wednesday that brings Google a step closer to facing legal sanctions under European law. The European Commission's specific allegation is a relatively narrow one — that the search giant has broken the law by giving Google Shopping a more favorable position in search results than other comparison shopping services — but the underlying policy issue is much broader. Following the logic of the EU complaint would require a massive transformation of Google's search product.</p> \n<p>The key point is that Google doesn't just give prime real estate to Google Shopping results. It unapologetically does it for products like Google Images, Google Maps, and Google News — all of which regularly show up in special boxes near the top of Google search results.</p> \n<p>Consequently, if you take the logic of the EC's complaint seriously, then EU regulators aren't going nearly far enough. If it's illegal to elevate Google Shopping over other search results, it should also be illegal to give special treatment to Google's other specialized search products for maps, news, or images.</p> \n<p>And indeed, that's exactly what Google's more ambitious critics are pushing for. If they win, it could lead to a dramatic transformation of Google's search product — one that may not be in the interests of customers.</p> \n<h3>Europe is focused on shopping, at least for now</h3> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""3615038"" alt=""147766546.0.jpg"" src=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3615038/147766546.0.jpg""></p> \n<p> </p> \n<p class=""caption"">(Georges Gobet/AFP/GettyImages)</p> \n<p> </p> \n<p>The European Commission <a href=""http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-15-4781_en.htm"">complains</a> that ""Google systematically positions and prominently displays its comparison shopping service in its general search results pages, irrespective of its merits,"" and that it has done so since 2008.</p> \n<p>The argument echoes charges that American and European regulators made against Microsoft in previous decades. During the 1990s and 2000s, the software giant repeatedly got in trouble for bundling products like Internet Explorer and Windows Media Player with its dominant operating system.</p> \n<p>Critics said this gave Microsoft an unfair advantage in these markets, harming rivals such as Netscape and RealNetworks. Now, Google's dominance of the search market is subjecting it to the same kind of regulatory scrutiny Microsoft started getting two decades ago.</p> \n<p>So why has the EC focused on shopping, while mostly ignoring the preferential placement given to other Google products? Mark Patterson, a legal scholar at Fordham University, believes European regulators probably focused on shopping because they ""have what they think is a smoking gun"" — though Patterson says we don't yet know what that is. For example, if the EC had evidence that Google chose to promote its own shopping products despite internal data showing customers preferred results from third parties, that could be a basis for legal action.</p> \n<p>Another likely reason for the focus on shopping: a European shopping site, Foundem, has been a leading advocate for EU officials to take action against Google. Foundem's crusade against Google started nine years ago, when Foundem discovered that its pages had been <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2010/nov/30/google-foundem-ec-competition-rules"">deleted from Google</a>. Foundem has long since been restored to Google's index, but Foundem has been seeking action by EU regulators ever since.</p> \n<h3>Google promotes its own products all the time</h3> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""3615068"" alt=""144948913.0.jpg"" src=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3615068/144948913.0.jpg""></p> \n<p> </p> \n<p class=""caption"">Google CEO Larry Page. (The Washington Post/Getty)</p> \n<p><span>Whatever the motives for the specific focus on shopping, it's clear that the general principle has much wider implications.</span></p> \n<p>If you search for ""White House memorabilia,"" you get a result like this:</p> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3615526/Screen_Shot_2015-04-16_at_5.31.34_PM.0.png"" alt=""Screen_Shot_2015-04-16_at_5.31.34_PM.0.png"" data-chorus-asset-id=""3615526""></p> \n<p>Notice the big ""Shop for white house memorabilia on Google"" box at the top of the results. If you click on the link, it will take you to Google Shopping, where you can <a href=""https://www.google.com/search?q=white+house+souvenirs&amp;rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS503US503&amp;espvd=2&amp;source=univ&amp;tbm=shop&amp;tbo=u&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=AssuVYOFCseIsQSGyICgDg&amp;ved=0CIcBELMY&amp;biw=1018&amp;bih=706"">browse a selection</a> of White House memorabilia.</p> \n<p>But that's hardly an isolated example. Search for ""White House photos,"" and you get results that look like this:</p> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""3615132"" alt=""Screen_Shot_2015-04-15_at_4.32.14_PM.0.png"" src=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3615132/Screen_Shot_2015-04-15_at_4.32.14_PM.0.png""></p> \n<p>Search for ""White House directions,"" and you get results like this:</p> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""3615134"" alt=""Screen_Shot_2015-04-15_at_4.32.34_PM.0.png"" src=""https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3615134/Screen_Shot_2015-04-15_at_4.32.34_PM.0.png""></p> \n<p>Google's search engine hasn't always worked this way. Google called this approach of blending results from different types of specialized search engines into a single page of results ""universal search"" when it was introduced in 2007.</p> \n<p>Google says universal search is good for customers because it helps provide the most relevant search results. But critics say universal search gives Google's specialized search products an unfair and illegal advantage.</p> \n<h3>Google's critics want the EC to go much farther</h3> \n<p>Foundem isn't just unhappy with Google's treatment of shopping results. Foundem views the whole concept of universal search as anticompetitive. In a <a href=""http://www.foundem.co.uk/Foundem_Preferencing_Data_and_Arguments.pdf"">2010 white paper</a>, Foundem noted that Google Maps displaced MapQuest as the leading online mapping service not long after Google Maps began appearing in search results in May 2007:</p> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""3615142"" alt=""google_vs_mapquest.0.png"" src=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3615142/google_vs_mapquest.0.png""></p> \n<p>Frank Pasquale, a legal scholar at the University of Maryland, agrees with Foundem's critique. ""You don't want to create a situation where the dominant interface by which people are trying to find mapping technology is going to squeeze out all of the oxygen for potential rivals,"" Pasquale says.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""right""><span>Even if the EU wins in court, it could be difficult to come up with an appropriate remedy</span></q></p> \n<p>Pasquale would like to see regulators force Google to provide a level playing field for a wide variety of specialized search projects, including shopping and maps. In his vision, Google might be required to show results from Google competitors as often as it showed results from Google's own products. He argues that this kind of mandate would nurture the growth of small startups, leading to more innovation in the long run.</p> \n<p>But others are more skeptical. Randal Picker, an antitrust expert at the University of Chicago, agrees that it seems arbitrary to single out Google's treatment of shopping while ignoring the treatment of other specialized search products. But he seemed less enthusiastic about what the EU was doing than Pasquale.</p> \n<p>One big problem, Picker says, is that even if the EU wins in court, it could be difficult to come up with an appropriate remedy. For example, a few years ago the EU forced Microsoft to add a ""browser ballot"" to Windows, allowing users to decide which browser to use. But when a technical glitch prevented the ballot from appearing in 2011, <a href=""http://www.cnet.com/news/microsoft-the-eu-fine-and-a-browser-ballot-no-one-missed/"">no one noticed</a> for more than a year. Similarly, when EU regulators forced Microsoft to distribute a copy of Windows without Windows Media Player installed, it <a href=""http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/legal/european/04-24-06windowsxpnsalesfs.mspx"">only sold a few thousand copies</a>, compared with tens of millions of copies for the mainstream version. The EU's remedies against Microsoft were toothless, and they'll have to think hard about how to avoid this kind of mistake with Google.</p> \n<p>Another problem is more fundamental: getting regulators involved in designing search results could hamper innovation. Google's practice of including results from its other products in search results pages might be bad for competitors, but it's undeniably convenient for many users.</p> \n<p>In theory, it should be possible to require Google to display competitors' results in place of Google's own results. But in practice, the increased bureaucracy could deter Google from making beneficial improvements to its search results page altogether.</p> \n<p><strong>Disclosure:</strong> My <a href=""https://twitter.com/startupandrew"" target=""_blank"">brother</a> is an executive at Google.</p>",Business & Finance

There's nothing crazy about Slack's $2.8 billion valuation,http://www.vox.com/2015/4/17/8442639/slack-no-bubble,People should stop being surprised when successful internet startups are worth billions of dollars.,"<p>The one-year-old corporate messaging company Slack has raised $160 million in a deal that values the startup at $2.8 billion. As always happens when a young company raises a lot of money, <a href=""http://www.theverge.com/2015/4/17/8431989/slacks-massive-new-funding-round-is-everything-amazing-and-insane"">people</a> are <a href=""http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/04/16/is-slack-really-worth-2-8-billion-a-conversation-with-stewart-butterfield/"">describing</a> this as evidence of a tech bubble — an unsustainable increase in the value of technology stocks.</p> \n<p>People have been <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6IQ_FOCE6I"">saying</a> there's a technology bubble for the past decade, and so far they haven't been proven right. But pointing to Slack's $2.8 billion valuation as evidence of a bubble is particularly unconvincing.</p> \n<p>Back in the 1990s, there were a lot of tech startups with no revenue and no real plans for earning revenues. That was a bubble, and those companies failed when the bubble popped.</p> \n<p>More recently, there have been companies — like Twitter and Facebook in their early days — with no revenue but a <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/7/29/5949647/why-we-shouldnt-be-surprised-about-twitters-rapid-revenue-growth"">totally plausible plan</a> for generating revenue by showing people ads. People shouldn't have been surprised when these companies started making a lot of money, and yet they were.</p> \n<p>But Slack isn't in either of these categories. It has one of the most straightforward possible business plans: <a href=""https://voxmedia.slack.com/pricing"">charge businesses a monthly fee</a> on a per-user basis. Slack's prices start at $6.67 per user per month, so if it has 200,000 paying users, as the New York Times reports, then the product should generate at least $16 million in revenues this year.</p> \n<p>Obviously, $16 million in annual revenues isn't enough to justify a $2.8 billion valuation. But the opportunities to grow that number are obvious. First, 200,000 people is a tiny fraction of America's — to say nothing of the world's — workforce. There's opportunity to have 2 or even 20 million paying users over the next decade, which would translate to more than a billion dollars in annual revenue.</p> \n<p>Second, there's a lot of room to upsell. That $6.67-per-month fee is a low price for business software. The company's <a href=""https://voxmedia.slack.com/pricing"">pricing page</a> signals that it expects it will be able to charge 10 times as much for an ""enterprise"" version of Slack that integrates with companies' existing IT systems.</p> \n<p>So imagine that a few years from now, Slack has 10 million paying users (about 6 percent of the US workforce) and generates an average of $10 per month of revenue from each. Suppose also that the company has a 50 percent profit margin (that's high for most companies, but it doesn't cost very much to run an online service). At a price-to-earnings ratio of 15 — typical for a mature technology stock — this company would be worth $9 billion. So if you think Slack can maintain its current momentum for a few more years, $2.8 billion is a bargain. And Slack could easily attract more than 10 million users and generate more than $10 per user.</p> \n<p>People are still in the habit of thinking of the internet as a bleeding-edge technology with an unproven ability to support profitable businesses. But it's long past that point. The internet has become a central part of hundreds of millions of people's personal and professional lives. People should stop being surprised when a company that makes millions of internet users more productive is valued at billions of dollars.</p>",Business & Finance
This is what you do if you want to start a new union,http://www.vox.com/2015/4/17/8443405/how-to-start-a-union,Gawker's staff wants to start a labor union. That can be really hard â€” if the bosses want to fight you.,"<p>Staffers at Gawker Media are <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/media/2015/06/8569365/gawker-goes-union"">organizing a union</a> under the auspices of the Writer's Guild of America. This prompted a very bold member of the Vox team to observe to me that perhaps Vox should write an explainer on how one goes about forming a union. ""Don't ask management how to form a union"" is usually one good step.</p> \n<p>The specific procedure actually differs depending on where you work.<strong> </strong>Government workers' unionization rights are governed by 50 different sets of state law. Airline workers are governed by a somewhat different process originally created for railroads. But for a basic private-sector worker who has nothing to do with airplanes, there is, in theory, a pretty clear process.</p> \n<p>To delve deeper, the key thing to know is that labor-management relations in the United States are so bad, and American companies generally so averse to unionization, that there is a significant mismatch between how the process works on paper and how it works in practice.</p> \n<h3>A unionization drive in theory</h3> \n<p>The National Labor Relations Act basically says that if most of the workers in a given unit want to appoint a labor union to bargain on behalf of all of them collectively, they have a legal right to force management to recognize that union as their exclusive bargaining agent.</p> \n<p>To make that happen at your workplace, you need to:</p> \n<ol> \n<li>Identify the unit of workers you're talking about. (At Gawker Media it sounds like all writers across the company's verticals, with discussion underway as to which editors are sufficiently senior to count as supervisors and be out of the union.)</li> \n<li>Identify a labor union that you want to represent you. (At Gawker it's the Writer's Guild, of which, full disclosure, my father is a longtime member. The Newspaper Guild, which represents most unionized print journalists, would have been the other plausible choice.)</li> \n<li>Send to the regional NLRB office cards or petitions indicating that at least 30 percent of the members of your unit want a unionization election.</li> \n<li>Secure at least 50 percent of the vote in the election the NLRB will then organize. </li> \n<li>Now your newly formed union local will bargain with management for a contract.</li> \n</ol> \n<p>That's in theory. In reality, it could even happen! Maybe your bargaining unit is people who work at a factory in Tennessee building cars for a <a href=""http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2013/09/06/vw_and_uaw_in_tennessee.html"">German company that is partially owned by the government of a German state</a> and the German state in question has a newly elected Social Democratic government, and the union representing your German workers is pressing you to be neutral in the election.</p> \n<p>A more typical union organizing effort, however, is a much uglier, litigation-riddled and politicized mess.</p> \n<h3>Union organizing in practice</h3> \n<p>The <a href=""http://www.cwa-union.org/pages/how_to_organize_a_union"">practice actual American labor unions advise</a> is to try to informally organize in a low-key way without tipping off management for as long as possible. You want to start with an internal organizing committee that is broadly representative of the workplace.  Then you want to try to build clear majority support for the union <em>before</em> you call for an election.</p> \n<p>That's because once the election is underway, management has formidable tools at its disposal to tilt the campaign in their direction. Managers can't directly threaten to reduce employment if unionization is successful, <a href=""http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/04/14/us-boeing-machinists-idUSKBN0N50BL20150414"">but nearby Republican Party politicians can do it for them</a>.</p> \n<p>They're also not allowed to do favors for workers who wear anti-union shirts and pins to work while penalizing those who sport pro-union gear, but any normal person is going to have his suspicions.</p> \n<p>Bosses can also hold meetings where they propagandize against the union, and generally take advantage of being the boss to shift the landscape in their favor.</p> \n<p>There are also ample opportunities along the way to litigate.</p> \n<p>For example, if your proposed unit is relatively small the bosses can argue that it's <em>too</em> small and the relevant bargaining group should be bigger, and you haven't hit the 30 percent threshold in that bigger group. Or if your proposed bargaining unit is really big, the bosses can go in the other direction and try to minimize the impact of unionization by making it smaller. Then they can litigate around the cards and around the election. Then, once the union is formed, the bosses can stall for years and years on actually signing a contract.</p> \n<h3>Unions are weak in America — except for in New York</h3> \n<p>Overall, labor unions are extremely weak in the United States, especially in the private sector. As of 2014, <a href=""http://www.bls.gov/news.release/union2.nr0.htm"">11.1 percent of American workers were in a union</a>, down from 20.1 percent in 1983. But Gawker writers might have better luck in New York, a state that somewhat bucks the trend.</p> \n<p>In the private sector, only 6.6 percent of workers are in a labor union. This means that even though the vast majority of Americans work in the private sector, overall labor union membership is almost perfectly balanced between the public sector's 7.2 million workers and the private sector's 7.4 million workers.</p> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""3616842"">\n<img src=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3616842/union-density-2014.0.jpg""> \n<div class=""caption""> \n<p>The rise and fall of US labor unions.</p> \n</div> \n</div> \n<p>The private-sector unionization rate has been <a href=""http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2013/03/20/private_sector_labor_unions_have_always_been_in_decline.html"">declining steadily since the early 1950s</a>, which was partially offset for a time by a <a href=""http://lbo-news.com/2015/01/23/union-density-erodes-again-and-why-bosses-hate-unions/"">surge in public-sector unionization</a>.</p> \n<p>A partial exception to this, however, is in Gawker Media's home state of New York, where the overall union membership rate is a fairly high 24.2 percent and where the local political climate is dramatically more supportive of unionization than is the case nationally.</p>",Business & Finance

In the 1950s and '60s, for instance, Canadian electric utilities <a href=""http://bldgblog.blogspot.com/2006/06/transformer-houses.html"">built hundreds of entirely fake houses</a> throughout Toronto to conceal substations.</p> \n<p>In the 1980s, soon after cellphone companies started building antennas in the United States, they sought to hide them, as well, often in response to aesthetic complaints from local residents — as detailed in historian <a href=""https://books.google.com/books?id=-a5qBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT214&amp;lpg=PT214&amp;dq=larson+camouflage+1992&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=bBKdfvJq8I&amp;sig=PwSZ7GqmQANJRtMoGzXvfQJC_7I&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Oy4xVdXrLdKLyASqt4C4CA&amp;ved=0CFEQ6AEwDA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false"">Bernard Mergen's excellent chapter</a> in <em><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Analyzing-Art-Aesthetics-Artefacts-Technology/dp/1935623133"">Analyzing Art and Aesthetics</a></em>.</p> \n<p>Initially, most concealed antennas were <a href=""https://books.google.com/books?id=-a5qBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT214&amp;lpg=PT214&amp;dq=larson+camouflage+1992&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=bBKdfvJq8I&amp;sig=PwSZ7GqmQANJRtMoGzXvfQJC_7I&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Oy4xVdXrLdKLyASqt4C4CA&amp;ved=0CFEQ6AEwDA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false"">simply hidden on church steeples or water towers</a>, but in 1992, a company called <a href=""http://utilitycamo.com/history/"">Larson Camouflage</a> — which had previously <a href=""https://books.google.com/books?id=-a5qBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT214&amp;lpg=PT214&amp;dq=larson+camouflage+1992&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=bBKdfvJq8I&amp;sig=PwSZ7GqmQANJRtMoGzXvfQJC_7I&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Oy4xVdXrLdKLyASqt4C4CA&amp;ved=0CFEQ6AEwDA#v=onepage&amp;q=larson%20camouflage%201992&amp;f=false"">made fake habitats</a> for Disney World and museums — built a ""pine"" tower in Denver. The world was changed forever.</p> \n<p>Soon afterward, companies in <a href=""http://www.stealthconcealment.com/"">South Carolina</a> and <a href=""http://www.brolaz.co.za/ReadContent.aspx?id=168"">South Africa</a> began building similar ""trees."" In the US, the Telecommunications Act of 1996 restricted municipalities' <a href=""http://wireless.fcc.gov/fact1.pdf"">ability to block tower construction</a>, so as demand for cell service spread, it meant that towers would inevitably be built in historic districts and other areas where locals might object.</p> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3618364/1326219.0.jpg"" alt=""tree cambridge"" data-chorus-asset-id=""3618364""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">A ""tree"" in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

The company <a href=""http://www.stealthconcealment.com/concealment-products/das-small-cell-concealments/"">Stealth Concealment</a> says it builds about 350 new ""trees"" per year. They're most often built in suburbs, where residents have the time and urge to war with companies over new towers, and there's enough incentive for carriers to invest in ""trees.""</p> \n<h3>Why these ""trees"" look so ridiculous</h3> \n<p>There are actually good reasons why these towers seldom actually look like real trees.</p> \n<p>One is height. Towers are built to hold antennas higher than surrounding structures to ensure good reception, so they have to be taller than what's nearby. This is why you often see surreally tall ""pines"" or ""palms"" towering over normal trees.</p> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3618352/2263592418_d62d8c669b_o.0.jpg"" alt=""cell phone tower tree"" data-chorus-asset-id=""3618352""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">(<a href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/travel_aficionado/2263592418"">Travel Aficionado</a>)</p> \n<p>Another is cost. These ""trees"" are normal cellphone towers, which are then sent to companies like Larson or Stealth Concealment for plastic, fiberglass, or acrylic ""bark,"" ""branches,"" and ""needles"" to be added. This process is customized and expensive: it can add $100,000 or so to the baseline $150,000 cost of a tower.</p> \n<p>As Ryan McCarthy of Larson <a href=""https://books.google.com/books?id=-a5qBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT214&amp;lpg=PT214&amp;dq=larson+camouflage+1992&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=bBKdfvJq8I&amp;sig=PwSZ7GqmQANJRtMoGzXvfQJC_7I&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Oy4xVdXrLdKLyASqt4C4CA&amp;ved=0CFEQ6AEwDA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false"">told Bernard Mergen</a>, ""A pine tree that has 200 branches will be more appealing than one of the same height that has 100. However, the customer will not only incur the cost of 100 extra branches, but the extra wind load from the branches will also require that the pole be designed more stoutly.""</p> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3618360/8576531832_70a13ceba8_o.0.jpg"" alt=""cell phone tree"" data-chorus-asset-id=""3618360""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">(<a href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/russloar/8576531832"">Russ Allison Loar</a>)</p> \n<p>This is also why you so seldom see towers designed as deciduous trees, even in areas where they're much more common than pines — their branching structure makes them more complex and more expensive to build. Pines, palms, and cacti are much easier to approximate in plastic and fiberglass.</p> \n<p>In terms of blending in, the most successful towers are probably ""saguaros,"" which can plausibly be built in deserts where there are no trees that they have to tower over — and don't have expensive branches or needles that need to be attached.</p> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3618380/14298850772_97c14a3774_o.0.jpg"" alt=""cell cactus"" data-chorus-asset-id=""3618380""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">(<a href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/87249144@N08/14298850772"">Folsom Natural</a>)</p> \n<p>You can check out dozens of other examples of cellphone towers disguised as trees — but also as flagpoles, bell towers, and church crosses — <a href=""http://twistedsifter.com/2012/08/examples-of-cell-phone-tower-disguises/"">here</a>.</p>",Business & Finance

In an <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/04/16/is-slack-really-worth-2-8-billion-a-conversation-with-stewart-butterfield/"">interview with the New York Times's Farhad Manjoo</a>, Slack CEO Stewart Butterfield argued that this might be the best time in world history to raise money for a startup:</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p class=""p1"">I’ve been in this industry for 20 years. This is the best time to raise money ever. It might be the best time for any kind of business in any industry to raise money for all of history, like since the time of the ancient Egyptians. It’s certainly the best time for late-stage start-ups to raise money from venture capitalists since this dynamic has been around.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Why do investors have a seemingly insatiable appetite for technology companies like Slack? In trying to answer this question, I think a lot of people focus too much on characteristics of the technology sector itself. Silicon Valley companies are pioneering a lot of important innovations right now, but the same thing was true 10, 20, 30, and 40 years ago.</p> \n<p>Rather, I think the increasingly favorable environment for fundraising in Silicon Valley is a reflection of broader macroeconomic trends. Inflation-adjusted interest rates have been declining for decades, a sign that businesses are finding it more and more difficult to invest available capital in things like factories or research and development in ways that will produce high returns.</p> \n<p><span>Silicon Valley is one of the few remaining bright spots. The worse the returns on other investments get, the more </span><span>willing</span><span> investors become to take big risks in pursuit of higher returns.</span></p> \n<p>It's certainly possible that this will prove to be a bubble that pops in the next few years. But it's also possible that this is just the new normal. If interest rates stay low, any industry that shows a potential for rapid growth could be flooded with cash from investors desperate for higher returns.</p>",Business & Finance
The police are secretly using fake cellphone towers to spy on people,http://www.vox.com/2015/4/22/8463239/stingray-fbi-secret,The FBI is fighting a losing battle to keep controversial cellphone surveillance secret.,"<p>Did you know that law enforcement can track your cellphone with a fake cell tower? It's true — and devices that do this, known as stingrays, are at the center of a growing scandal.</p> \n<p>The FBI has <a href=""http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2015/02/fbi-really-doesnt-want-anyone-to-know-about-stingray-use-by-local-cops/"">done everything it could</a> to keep the existence and use of stingrays a secret. Local law enforcement agencies are <a href=""http://www.startribune.com/politics/statelocal/284945781.html"">forced to sign nondisclosure agreements</a> before they can use the devices. The FBI claims that revealing details about how the gadgets work would tip off criminals and terrorists, rendering them less effective.</p> \n<p>But in recent months, civil liberties groups have steadily chipped away at the secrecy of these devices. We've learned that <a href=""https://www.aclu.org/map/stingray-tracking-devices-whos-got-them"">they're used by dozens</a> — and probably hundreds — of law enforcement agencies across the country, and that at least one agency has used them <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/crime/blog/bs-md-ci-stingray-new-disclosures-20150420-story.html"">thousands of times</a>.</p> \n<p>Critics say the way these devices have been used violates the US Constitution, by tracking people's locations without judicial oversight. And the secrecy surrounding the devices also appears to be hampering efforts to prosecute violent criminals, as prosecutors have dropped key evidence rather than discuss how it was obtained.</p> \n<p>The extreme secrecy surrounding these devices is out of step with the American tradition of open and accountable government. Americans have a right to know that law enforcement spying has proper judicial oversight. And this kind of oversight is impossible if even basic information about the technology is kept under wraps.</p> \n<h3>Stingrays are fake cellphone towers police use to spy on people</h3> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3628506/stingray.0.png"" alt=""stingray.0.png"" data-chorus-asset-id=""3628506""></p> \n<p> </p> \n<p class=""caption"">A stingray surveillance device.</p> \n<p> </p> \n<p>When you turn on your cellphone, it scans the surrounding area to find the cellular tower with the best connection. It then communicates with this tower to send and receive phone calls and other data.</p> \n<p>A device called a cell-site simulator, popularly known as a ""stingray,"" lets law enforcement spy on people by pretending to be a cellphone tower. This device, not much larger than a toaster, fools nearby mobile devices into connecting to it instead of to a real cellphone tower. <span>That gives law enforcement information about the identity and precise location of nearby mobile devices. Police departments say they never use the devices to intercept the contents of people's calls or messages, though it's hard to verify that without knowing more about how they work.</span></p> \n<p>By turning everyone's cellphone into a tracking device, stingrays allow cops to track suspects from the back of a van hundreds of feet away — without any help from the target's cellular provider. Unsurprisingly, the devices have proliferated to police departments across the country.</p> \n<p>And while we don't know the full extent of Stingray use, there's evidence that they're used heavily by law enforcement agencies. The ACLU has compiled a map of states where law enforcement is known to be using the devices — there are almost certainly other places where their use has yet to be uncovered:</p> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3628522/stingray_use.0.png"" alt=""stingray_use.0.png"" data-chorus-asset-id=""3628522""></p> \n<p> </p> \n<p class=""caption"">(<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.aclu.org/map/stingray-tracking-devices-whos-got-them"">American Civil Liberties Union</a>)</p> \n<p> </p> \n<p>How often are the devices used? Most police departments won't say. But police in Baltimore recently <a href=""http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/crime/blog/bs-md-ci-stingray-new-disclosures-20150420-story.html"">admitted</a> that they've used the device 4,300 times. And we don't know how many of these uses occurred with court approval — we'll discuss the legal issues more below.</p> \n<h3>The FBI has closely guarded the secrecy of stingray technology</h3> \n<p>We know that many law enforcement agencies use this technology, but we don't know how many agencies use the devices or how often they do so. That's because an elaborate scheme has mostly kept the devices out of the public eye until recently.</p> \n<p><q class=""right"" aria-hidden=""true""><span>The FBI thinks that releasing even seemingly minor information can cause harm</span></q></p> \n<p>Because stingrays emit radio waves, they must be approved by the Federal Communications Commission before they can be used. Harris Corporation, the leading manufacturer of the devices, asked the FCC to require state and local law enforcement agencies to get approval from the FBI before they can use the devices. And the FBI, in turn, requires law enforcement agencies to sign nondisclosure agreements in order to get access.</p> \n<p>The FBI declined to comment for this story, but a spokesman sent me a copy of a <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3628612/state_FOIA_affidavit_signed_04112014.0.pdf"">2014 affidavit</a> from an FBI official explaining why the agency requires that information about the devices be kept secret. The FBI says that giving the public details about how stingray technology works or how it's used could provide criminals and terrorists with information that allows them to ""develop defensive technology, modify their behaviors, and otherwise take countermeasures designed to thwart the use of this technology.""</p> \n<p>The FBI thinks that releasing even seemingly minor information can cause harm, since the bad guys can piece together different bits of information to learn how stingrays work and how they can be evaded.</p> \n<p>Earlier this month, the New York Civil Liberties Union obtained a copy of the nondisclosure agreement the FBI asked the sheriff's office in Erie County, New York, to sign in order to use cell-site simulators. The agreement bars recipients from telling anyone about the devices, and specifically prohibits Erie County law enforcement from disclosing information about stingray technology in court.</p> \n<h3>Stingray secrecy appears to be hampering prosecutions</h3> \n<p>The FBI's gag order appears to be undermining efforts to prosecute violent criminals. This week, for example, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch <a href=""http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/controversial-secret-phone-tracker-figured-in-dropped-st-louis-case/article_fbb82630-aa7f-5200-b221-a7f90252b2d0.html"">reported</a> that the St. Louis city police chose to drop the prosecution of three men charged in a violent robbery spree shortly before a government witness would have had to testify about the use of stingray devices in the case. Prosecutors say the timing was a coincidence.</p> \n<p><q class=""right"" aria-hidden=""true""><span>Judges are getting fed up with the secrecy surrounding stingrays</span></q></p> \n<p>In a Baltimore case last year, prosecutors chose to <a href=""http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/baltimore-city/bs-md-ci-stingray-officer-contempt-20141117-story.html#page=1"">drop evidence</a> about the location of a suspect's phone after an angry judge insisted that police explain how they had located it. In Florida, prosecutors <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/secrecy-around-police-surveillance-equipment-proves-a-cases-undoing/2015/02/22/ce72308a-b7ac-11e4-aa05-1ce812b3fdd2_story.html"">offered a defendant a generous plea deal</a> to avoid having to comply with a judge's order to show a stingray device to the defendants' lawyers.</p> \n<p>If the FBI continues insisting on keeping the devices secret, this problem is only going to get worse. In the past, defense attorneys didn't know that stingrays existed, so they didn't ask questions about them. But now defense lawyers not only know the devices exist, they also know that pressing for information about them can force prosecutors to drop the case. So expect law enforcement to face a lot more awkward questions about this in the coming months.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, there are signs that judges are getting fed up with the secrecy surrounding stingrays. When a Baltimore police officer said he was barred from discussing the stingray in court due to a nondisclosure agreement, Baltimore Judge Barry Williams retorted, ""You don't have a nondisclosure agreement with the court,"" and threatened to hold the cop in contempt if he didn't answer the question.</p> \n<h3>Stingrays — and stingray secrecy — raise constitutional issues</h3> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3628618/13089721895_d80616a175_o__1_.0.jpg"" alt=""13089721895_d80616a175_o__1_.0.jpg"" data-chorus-asset-id=""3628618""></p> \n<p> </p> \n<p class=""caption"">(<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/chiropractic/13089721895/in/photolist-4WS7PH-4a1m7o-q9C9YP-53gTNT-eGVCue-4vHH1S-kWGfhg-5VLTZt-4oh2fS-frZqqE-nf3LQP-6AgNsE-q8fDZe-4ZKjij-4ZKiTo-4zwERR-9TiRCS-4ZKiFo-aDDjdb-8YUbo8-owrpfv-hi3Hh-7M9CCC-4FVhNt-4c7NoX-5SD5JM-8hoL7q-drmiBW-PBsyv-3fDLHg-6uWEj8-drmhNU-fT1n37-dq4E4Y-hRRNB-347ej6-4RmzoP-jfQtg2-a8triU-pv8ebx-cZgcLs-okaPSc-Au9XG-hQByKh-5v74rH-k2BCR1-cZgdb9-8jqk7X-6dLxpm-aqBa8k"">Michael Dorausch</a>)</p> \n<p> </p> \n<p>Adam Bates, an analyst at the Cato Institute (where I was a staff writer from 2003 to 2005), says that law enforcement use of stingrays raises two different constitutional issues.</p> \n<p>One has to do with the Fourth Amendment. While the law isn't totally clear, a 2012 Supreme Court ruling suggested that tracking a suspect's location without a warrant may run afoul of the Fourth Amendment's rule against warrantless surveillance. For example, Bates notes that documents in Erie County showed that police ""had deployed the device 47 times and had only gotten one court order."" Future court cases will likely clarify when the police must seek judicial approval before tracking suspects.</p> \n<p>A related problem, Bates says, is that when police use a stingray, they capture information about every cellphone in a large area. That means that in the process of spying on a single criminal suspect, they may also capture information about the location of dozens of totally innocent people, as well — making judicial oversight all the more necessary.</p> \n<p>Also, it wouldn't be difficult for stingray-type devices to intercept not only a suspect's location and identity, but also the contents of his communications. Bates says law enforcement agencies have consistently denied that they do this. But given the potential for abuse, he argues that more oversight is needed to verify that these devices are not being used for illegal wiretapping.</p> \n<p>And Bates says the FBI's gag order raises additional constitutional issues. ""We have a long history of not allowing that kind of secret evidence,"" Bates says. The Constitution guarantees defendants the right to see evidence used against them and interrogate opposing witnesses. So even if warrantless stingray surveillance is legal, barring prosecutors and police officers from discussing it in court might still violate the Constitution.</p> \n<h3>It's time for the FBI to come clean about stingrays</h3> \n<p>The FBI claims it needs to keep information about stingrays under wraps to prevent the bad guys from learning how to evade surveillance. That argument might have made sense a decade ago when the use of this technology was unknown, but it doesn't make much sense today.</p> \n<p>This isn't how we handle other police surveillance techniques. For example, law enforcement has long had the power to wiretap people's telephones. Information about specific wiretapping operations — whose phone lines are being tapped, and when — are kept secret for obvious reasons. But the existence of wiretapping capabilities is not a secret.</p> \n<p><q class=""right"" aria-hidden=""true""><span>There's no way to put the stingray genie back in the bottle</span></q></p> \n<p>Nevertheless, criminals regularly make incriminating statements over tapped phone lines. That's partly because criminals can be careless, and partly because it's hard to know which information might turn out to be incriminating. There's no reason to think that providing more information about how stingrays work would destroy the devices' utility to law enforcement.</p> \n<p>We don't know if warrantless cellphone tracking is legal or not. Law enforcement agencies have insisted that the Fourth Amendment doesn't apply in this type of situation, and the courts have yet to squarely address the situation. Prosecuting people using secret evidence certainly seems constitutionally problematic.</p> \n<p>In any event, there's no way to put the stingray genie back in the bottle. At this point, smart criminals are going to assume that the police have the ability to track their cell phones. If the FBI continues to insist on secrecy, it's only going to hamper the efforts of prosecutors, who will be put at a disadvantage by their inability to explain how they got incriminating evidence.</p>",Business & Finance

Both services automatically rebate customers for unused data.</p> \n<p>That could translate into serious savings for most cellphone users. For example, I currently use about 2 GB of data per month and pay about $100 per month for my AT&amp;T service. Under Google's plan, I'd pay around $40 per month. And if Google only charges for cellular connectivity, not wifi, (which seems likely, though its website isn't entirely clear), the savings could be even larger, since Google's phones are designed to use free wifi networks more and cellular networks less than conventional cellphones.</p> \n<p>Republic Wireless's service only works with Android-based Motorola phones that Republic has customized to support seamless switching between wifi and cellular networks. Similarly, Project Fi will initially only work with the Google's Nexus 6 smartphone, though presumably other phones will be added in the future.</p> \n<h3>Google's new service could have a huge effect on the wireless industry</h3> \n<p>Google isn't planning to build its own cellphone towers. Instead, the search giant is reselling cellular bandwidth provided by Sprint and T-Mobile. Yet Google's business model is likely to exert significant downward pressure on incumbent wireless providers.</p> \n<p>By enabling users to seamlessly shift between wifi and cellular networks, Project Fi (and before them, Republic Wireless) could turn cellular service into more of a commodity. Right now, wireless providers sell phones that use cellular networks the majority of the time and charge them $50 to $100 per month for the privilege. Having spent billions of dollars on wireless spectrum and cellular towers, incumbent wireless providers have had little reason to encourage people to use wifi more and cellular networks less.</p> \n<p>But Google has little to lose and a lot to gain by pushing down the cost of wireless service. Not only could it build a profitable business, but cheaper wireless service could also encourage people to use their smartphones — and Google products like Android and YouTube — more.</p> \n<p>So if Project Fi catches on, it could force wireless providers to cut their prices and improve support for switching between wifi and cellular networks — something that's awkward on cellphones today. The resulting cost-savings should benefit everyone who owns a cellphone.</p> \n<p><b>Disclosure</b><span>: My </span><a href=""https://twitter.com/startupandrew"" sl-processed=""1"">brother</a><span> is an </span><a href=""https://www.firebase.com/blog/2014-10-21-firebase-joins-google.html"" target=""_blank"" sl-processed=""1"">executive</a><span> at Google.</span></p>",Business & Finance
The big challenge facing Google's new smartphone service,http://www.vox.com/2015/4/23/8482523/google-project-fi-challenge,"Google hopes to help people shift from cellular to wifi, but history suggests that might not be so easy.","<p>When Google announced a new cellphone service called Project Fi on Wednesday, I was <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/4/22/8470025/project-fi-google-wireless"">pretty excited</a>. The service aims to reduce the cost of wireless connectivity by helping customers rely more heavily on cheap wifi networks rather than expensive cellular ones.</p> \n<p>But reading and thinking more about the service has tempered my enthusiasm somewhat. I still think these services will exert some pressure on incumbent wireless cellphone carriers to cut prices. But so long as Google is reselling those companies' services, there's a limit to how much savings it can offer.</p> \n<p>The big question is how much Google can help customers shift off of cellular networks in favor of free wifi networks. The experience of Republic Wireless, a startup that pioneered Google's wifi-first model, suggests that it's not as easy as it looks.</p> \n<h3>Why Project Fi can't make cellular service cheaper</h3> \n<p>Ars Technica's Ron Amadeo <a href=""http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2015/04/how-googles-project-fi-pricing-stacks-up-to-the-competition/"">compiled this chart</a> showing how the service stacks up against competitors:</p> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""3635404"" alt=""Screen-Shot-2015-03-23-at-4.14.41-PM-980x551.0.jpg"" src=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3635404/Screen-Shot-2015-03-23-at-4.14.41-PM-980x551.0.jpg""></p> \n<p> </p> \n<p class=""caption"">(Ars Technica)</p> \n<p> </p> \n<p>Amadeo notes that this chart has some caveats, as different carriers' plans aren't perfectly comparable. But there are two broad trends evident from it.</p> \n<p>First, Project Fi will be most appealing to customers at the low end of the market. If you want a bare-bones plan that uses less than 1 GB of data from cellular networks, Project Fi is a more affordable option than any of the alternatives you see here.</p> \n<p>On the other hand, for customers who need large amounts of cellular data Google's offering isn't a particularly good deal. Other providers offer cheaper packages at the 3 GB and 5 GB levels.</p> \n<p>And if you know how Project Fi works, this makes perfect sense. Google doesn't own its own cellphone towers; instead, it's reselling capacity provided by Sprint and T-Mobile. The people running those companies aren't stupid, so they're not going to sell Google capacity at a price low enough for Google to undercut their own offerings.</p> \n<h3>Google could save customers money by offloading data to wifi</h3> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""3635418"" alt=""119356743_0fbdb9db80_o.0.jpg"" src=""https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3635418/119356743_0fbdb9db80_o.0.jpg""></p> \n<p> </p> \n<p class=""caption"">Wifi routers are cheap and easy to set up.

First, setting up a cellular tower is a complex and expensive undertaking, while installing wifi equipment is so simple and cheap that most of us have one in our homes. Second, cellular companies have paid billions of dollars to the federal government for exclusive wireless frequencies, while wifi uses freely available shared spectrum.</p> \n<p>If Google can help customers use wifi more and cellular service less, it can save customers money. There are two basic ways Project Fi tries to do this. One is to make it easier for people to use the wifi networks they already have. Virtually all modern smartphones have built-in wifi chips, but switching from wifi to cellular networks — or vice versa — can be a hassle.</p> \n<p>Following in the footsteps of a <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/3/9/8172063/google-republic-wireless-wifi"">startup called Republic Wireless</a>, Google Fi offers a phone service that can automatically switch between wifi and cellular networks without dropping calls. That allows users to make calls from their home wifi connection without worrying about losing the call if they go out of range.</p> \n<p>The second way Google helps people use wifi more is by helping users find other wifi networks to log into. Google has a ""network quality database"" to help it identify wifi access points that are freely available. And it uses a privacy technology called VPN to prevent the owners of these networks from eavesdropping on a customer's communications.</p> \n<p>While Google hasn't announced any plans in this direction, it would make sense for it to take steps to expand the number of available wifi connections. Google will have detailed data about where its customers consume the most cellular data. It could pay households and businesses in these high-demand areas to provide wifi service to Project Fi customers, reducing those customers' dependence on expensive cellular service.</p> \n<p>The technology behind Project Fi could also work in concert with cable companies like Comcast that have <a href=""https://wifi.comcast.com/faqs.php"">enabled public wifi hotspots</a> in their customers' homes. Right now, these networks are hard to find and not always easy to join. But Google could work with Comcast to make sure the process is automatic, while paying Comcast for the bandwidth used.</p> \n<h3>The Republic Wireless model hasn't worked as well as expected</h3> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""3635428"" alt=""458910952.0.jpg"" src=""https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3635428/458910952.0.jpg""></p> \n<p> </p> \n<p class=""caption"">(Don Emmert/AFP/Getty Images)</p> \n<p> </p> \n<p>While it hasn't gotten as much attention as Google's announcement, news this week from Republic Wireless suggests that it may be difficult to use wifi to dramatically reduce cellular data use.</p> \n<p>Republic's original business model in 2012 was to couple wifi-first technology with <em>unlimited</em> cellular data service for shockingly low prices — starting at $19 per month. Republic hoped that customers would offload so much of their traffic to wifi networks that it could make a profit.</p> \n<p>Evidently, that plan didn't work out, and over time the company has raised its prices. Today, you can get unlimited data over slow 3G networks for $25 per month or unlimited 4G data for $40 per month. That's still a pretty good deal, but not nearly as good as the original pricing scheme.</p> \n<p>This week, the day before Google unveiled its wireless service, Republic announced yet another change to its pricing structure. While Republic didn't announce specific prices, it signaled that it would be shifting to the same model Google is using — a flat rate for   unlimited talk and text, plus metered pricing for data.</p> \n<p>This suggests that after three years of trying, Republic couldn't figure out a way to use wifi offloading to radically reduce customers' cellular data use. If they had, then that original pricing model should have worked.</p> \n<p>Of course, Google has some advantages Republic doesn't, including a strong brand name, a ton of capital, and a vast database of open wifi connections. It may figure out ways to improve on Republic's approach.</p> \n<p>But the wifi-first model will likely always still depend on cellular networks for backup. And those networks cost billions of dollars to build and maintain. So while Project Fi will probably help cellular customers save some money, people are going to continue spending significant sums for cellular service for the foreseeable future.</p> \n<p><b>Disclosure</b><span>: My </span><a sl-processed=""1"" href=""https://twitter.com/startupandrew"">brother</a><span> is an </span><a sl-processed=""1"" target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.firebase.com/blog/2014-10-21-firebase-joins-google.html"">executive</a><span> at Google.</span></p>",Business & Finance
2015 could be the year Congress takes action on patent trolls,http://www.vox.com/2015/4/27/8501489/patent-reform-2015,Lawmakers in both houses of Congress are preparing legislation to stop rampant abuse of the patent system.,"<p>There's a growing problem with patent trolls, the companies that create no products of their own but earn money threatening other companies with patent lawsuits. The problem has become so widespread that even low-tech companies like restaurants and grocery stores have begun lobbying Congress to do something about it.</p> \n<p>Now Congress could be on the verge of taking action. On Friday, a Senate aide close to the negotiations told me that a bipartisan group of senators is ""very close"" to introducing legislation with broad support in the Senate.</p> \n<p>Supporters of the legislation have good reason to be optimistic, as the coalition supporting the legislation is broader and more unified than in the past. But given Congress's penchant for gridlock, it's far from a sure thing.</p> \n<h3>What patent reform would do</h3> \n<p>Patent trolls take advantage of the fact that patent litigation is so expensive that it's often rational for defendants to pay even if they haven't done anything wrong. Patent reform legislation is expected to change how patent litigation works in ways that make the tactics used by trolls less profitable.</p> \n<p>One example is known as fee-shifting. By making trolls pay when they lose a patent lawsuit, this change would discourage frivolous lawsuits.</p> \n<p><q class=""right"" aria-hidden=""true""><span>Patent trolls take advantage of the fact that patent litigation is so expensive</span></q></p> \n<p>Another proposal would delay discovery — the expensive process in which each side must produce documents relevant to the lawsuit — until later in the process. This will give defendants a chance to get a lawsuit thrown out before racking up huge legal bills.</p> \n<p>A third reform would require patent holders to be specific about how a patent is being infringed — both when they send threatening letters to potential targets and when they file lawsuits.</p> \n<p>Finally, trolls sometimes use a divide-and-conquer strategy in which they target users of a product — who often lack the resources to fight back — rather than its manufacturer. Patent reform legislation may give manufacturers the option to step into their customers' shoes and fight a lawsuit on customers' behalf.</p> \n<h3>This is a rare issue on which bipartisan agreement is likely</h3> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3644742/168393914.0.jpg"" alt=""168393914.0.jpg"" data-chorus-asset-id=""3644742""></p> \n<p> </p> \n<p class=""caption"">Sen. <span>John Cornyn (R-TX)</span><span>, left,</span><span> and Sen. </span><span>Patrick Leahy (D-VT) </span><span>are influential advocates of patent reform legislation. (Bill Clark/CQ Roll Call)</span></p> \n<p> </p> \n<p>In the polarized environment of Washington, it's rare to find an issue that can unite Republicans and Democrats. But patent law — a complex and technical subject that has never been seen as a subject for partisan politics — is one issue on which bipartisan consensus seems within reach.</p> \n<p>That potential for bipartisan consensus was visible in 2013. The House of Representatives passed the Innovation Act, written by Rep. Bob Goodlatte (R-VA), the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, in December 2013. It received the support of 130 Democrats as well as 195 Republicans.</p> \n<p>But then Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV), an ally of trial lawyers who opposed the legislation, blocked it. They were concerned with ""fee-shifting"" rules that would make it easier for a winning defendant to recover legal costs from a troll. Trial lawyers are concerned that including this language in a patent reform bill could set a precedent for applying similar rules to other types of litigation.</p> \n<p>Reform advocates are trying again this year. Substantively, the new legislation is expected to be similar to the legislation the House passed in 2013. But this year, the legislation may have a better chance of getting through the Senate.</p> \n<p>Thanks to the 2014 election, Reid is no longer the majority leader, and his successor, Kentucky Republican Mitch McConnell, has no love for trial lawyers. Patent reformers also have a powerful ally in Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY), who will take over for Reid as Democratic leader in 2017 and has been pushing for strong patent legislation. Schumer has been working with his fellow Democrat, Patrick Leahy (VT), and two senior Republicans — Majority Whip John Cornyn (TX) and Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (IA) on the Senate bill.</p> \n<p>Schumer and Leahy supported the inclusion of some kind of fee-shifting language in the patent bill last year, and are expected to do so again this year. That leaves ample room for a compromise that should please most Republicans and many Democrats. And with Reid no longer in control of the Senate calendar, it will be harder for trial lawyers to scuttle a bill this year.</p> \n<h3>Technology companies have settled their differences to get patent reform done</h3> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3644804/185143360.0.jpg"" alt=""185143360.0.jpg"" data-chorus-asset-id=""3644804""></p> \n<p> </p> \n<p class=""caption"">Microsoft lobbied against a proposal to eliminate low-quality software patents in 2013. Now that idea has been shelved, and Microsoft is expected to support patent reform legislation. (Joe Raedle/Getty Images)</p> \n<p> </p> \n<p>In 2013, the patent reform debate was divided into three camps. On one side were pharmaceutical companies, patent lawyers, and other defenders of the status quo. They opposed the whole patent reform effort.<strong> </strong>On the other side was a coalition of technology companies — led by Google — and brick-and-mortar businesses that were lobbying for reform. Standing in the middle was a group of large software companies, most notably Microsoft.</p> \n<p><q class=""right"" aria-hidden=""true""><span>Reformers are anxious to avoid reopening an old wound</span></q></p> \n<p>Large, patent-rich software companies like Microsoft and IBM didn't object to going after patent trolls, but they lobbied against measures to nix low-quality software patents. Technology companies with fewer patents — and other industries frequently targeted by patent trolls —  lobbied for it. Ultimately, Microsoft and IBM won; <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2013/11/20/software-patent-reform-just-died-in-the-house-thanks-to-ibm-and-microsoft/"">the proposal was ultimately left out</a> of the patent legislation that passed the House.</p> \n<p>This year, reformers are anxious to avoid reopening this old wound. So they're planning to focus on procedural changes designed to hobble patent trolls, and leave out efforts to weed out bad patents.</p> \n<p>Earlier this year, patent reformers launched a <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2015/01/15/patent-reform-advocates-are-launching-a-super-coalition-to-whack-patent-trolls/"">new umbrella group called United for Patent Reform</a> that brings together a broad coalition of patent reform supporters. The members range from Facebook and Oracle to General Motors and even the Culver's fast-food chain.</p> \n<p>And while language to eliminate low-quality patents won't be part of this year's patent reform bill, supporters have gotten an important consolation prize: a 2014 Supreme Court ruling has <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/9/12/6138483/software-patents-are-crumbling-thanks-to-the-supreme-court"">called into question</a> the legality of the most dubious software patents. So the standards for patent quality are going up without Congress lifting a finger.</p> \n<h3>Universities and Big Pharma are key reform opponents</h3> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3644774/470555696.0.jpg"" alt=""470555696.0.jpg"" data-chorus-asset-id=""3644774""></p> \n<p> </p> \n<p class=""caption"">With Republicans in control of the Senate, Sen. Harry Ried (D-NV) won't be able to block patent reform legislation as he reportedly did last year. (Win McNamee/Getty Images)</p> \n<p> </p> \n<p>While patent reform has broad support, there are also some powerful interest groups on the other side. Two longtime opponents of patent reform are the pharmaceutical industry and patent attorneys. Both groups have prospered from current laws, and have little interest seeing the playing field tilted more toward defendants.</p> \n<p>A more surprising source of opposition to patent reform is universities. Since the 1980s, universities have developed ""technology transfer"" offices that patent inventions by university researchers and then demand that companies in the private sector pay licensing fees. In a <a href=""http://www.wsj.com/articles/a-patent-troll-bill-with-bad-college-grades-1429051694"">piece for the Wall Street Journal</a> earlier this month, two university presidents warned that patent reform legislation could ""change the U.S. patent system in ways that would diminish the benefits of university research."" My reporting suggests that university groups are actively lobbying against legislation like the bill the House passed in 2013.</p> \n<h3>In this Congress, nothing is certain</h3> \n<p>In 2013, the House of Representatives passed a patent reform bill before the Senate even had time to start working on one. This year, advocates plan to take a different approach, pushing the House and Senate versions of the legislation through in parallel. That will reduce the chances of the House putting a lot of time into legislation that never gets a serious hearing in the Senate.</p> \n<p><q class=""right"" aria-hidden=""true""><span>Last week, disagreement flared up over a House proposal to regulate demand letters</span></q></p> \n<p>On paper, patent reform has an excellent chance of passing in 2015. The lopsided vote for the 2013 legislation suggests broad bipartisan support in the House. And in the Senate, legislation is supported by some of the most powerful legislators on both sides of the aisle.</p> \n<p>But a lot could go wrong. Last week, disagreement flared up over a House proposal to regulate the vague demand letters trolls send to businesses in search of a quick payoff. Many patent reform groups <a href=""http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2015/04/22/reform-groups-bill-to-stop-patent-demand-letters-falls-short/"">opposed the bill</a>, arguing that it falls far short of what's needed. Patent reform advocates will need to iron out this kind of disagreement in order to shepherd a bill through Congress.</p> \n<p>The legislation could also be derailed due to outside forces. Last week, for example, Senate business ground to a halt due to a disagreement over abortion funding within a popular bill to combat human trafficking. While this fight was going on, other priorities — like patent reform — were put on hold.</p> \n<p>The human trafficking dispute has been resolved, so patent reform may be able to move forward. But there remain a lot of tricky issue to be resolved, and even if patent reformers do everything right, the legislation may or may not make it through the legislative process before the clock runs out.</p>",Business & Finance
Web encryption technology is 20 years old. So why isn't every site using it?,http://www.vox.com/2015/4/27/8503609/ssl-tls-security-privacy,SSL encryption doesn't just protect users' privacy â€” it also makes cyberattacks more difficult.,"<p>When you visit your bank, you probably see a green lock icon in your browser that looks like this:</p> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3646374/Screen_Shot_2015-04-26_at_1.00.01_PM.0.png"" alt=""Screen_Shot_2015-04-26_at_1.00.01_PM.0.png"" data-chorus-asset-id=""3646374""></p> \n<p>That icon means you're using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), a technology that encrypts communications between users and websites. SSL has been around for 20 years, and it's been widely used for financial transactions since the 1990s. But back then, the technology was too slow to be practical to use on every website.</p> \n<p>But as the technology has improved and computers have gotten faster, that's been changing. Sites like Facebook and Twitter began using SSL in the last few years, and media organizations like the New York Times are <a href=""http://open.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/11/13/embracing-https/"">currently working</a> to adopt it. Advocates hope that SSL will become ubiquitous in the next few years.</p> \n<p>People usually think of SSL as a way to protect people's privacy. When you browse a website that's not protected by SSL over a wifi network, the information you upload and download can be intercepted by other people near you. SSL prevents this by scrambling the data before it's sent across the network.</p> \n<p>A <a href=""http://googleonlinesecurity.blogspot.com/2015/04/a-javascript-based-ddos-attack-as-seen.html"" target=""_blank"">blog post</a> from security researchers at Google points out another huge benefit of using SSL across the web: it helps fight cyberattacks. The post analyzes <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/3/30/8315281/github-chinese-ddos-attacks"">last month's attack</a> against the programming site Github, which was hosting material that had been censored by the Chinese government. The attackers had inserted malicious software into webpages from the Chinese search engine Baidu. This software caused Baidu users' computers to begin flooding Github with traffic, temporarily knocking the site offline.</p> \n<p>As far as we can tell, Baidu wasn't responsible for these attacks. Rather, the attackers — widely believed to be connected to the Chinese government, though there's no proof of this so far — appear to have carried out this attack by modifying Baidu pages as they traveled across the Chinese internet.</p> \n<p>This kind of attack is a lot more difficult to carry out against a site that uses SSL. Webpages protected with SSL aren't just hard to intercept, they're also hard to modify, which means users won't be exposed to the risks of third parties tampering with the websites they visit.</p> \n<p>Google has started to apply significant pressure on website owners to upgrade to SSL. Last year, the company announced it would start <a href=""http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.com/2014/08/https-as-ranking-signal.html"">penalizing websites</a> that don't adopt it by docking their search results. The penalty is small for now, but Google says it may increase it in the coming years. That creates an added incentive for webmasters to get on board, improving security for both their users and the web as a whole.</p>",Business & Finance

Not only were iPad sales for the most recent quarter lower than they had been a year earlier, but those sales, in turn, were lower than the sales in the first three months of the 2013 calendar year.</p> \n<div id=""Quarterly_iPad_Sales_in_millions""></div> \n<p> \n<script type=""text/javascript""><!-- \nwindow.pym || document.write( '<scr' + 'ipt src=""http://apps.voxmedia.com/tools/javascripts/vendor/pym-cb3d02c4.js""></scr' + 'ipt>' ); \n// --></script> \n<script type=""text/javascript""><!-- \nvar Quarterly_iPad_Sales_in_millions = new pym.Parent( ""Quarterly_iPad_Sales_in_millions"", ""http://apps.voxmedia.com/tools/charts-public/?labels=Q3%202010%2CQ4%202010%2CQ1%202011%2CQ2%202011%2CQ3%202011%2CQ4%202011%2CQ1%202012%2CQ2%202012%2CQ3%202012%2CQ4%202012%2CQ1%202013%2CQ2%202013%2CQ3%202013%2CQ4%202013%2CQ1%202014%2CQ2%202014%2CQ3%202014%2CQ4%202014%2CQ1%202015%2CQ2%202015&datasets=3.3%2C4.2%2C7.3%2C4.7%2C9.2%2C11.1%2C15.4%2C11.8%2C17%2C14%2C22.9%2C19.5%2C14.6%2C14.1%2C26%2C16.3%2C13.3%2C12.3%2C21.4%2C12.6&title=Quarterly%20iPad%20Sales%2C%20in%20millions&description=null&source=Apple&link=null&type=bar&legend="", { xdomain: "".*.voxmedia.com"" } ); \n// --></script> \n</p> \n<p>As you can see, the latest results are part of a broader trend. After four years of growth, iPad sales peaked in the 2013 holiday season (Apple's fiscal year starts in October, so the company calls this Q1 2014), and have been declining ever since.</p> \n<p>Why is this happening? I suspect two factors are contributing to the iPad's decline. First, people who already have iPads just don't have that much reason to upgrade. People don't take their iPads around the house as much as they do their iPhones, so there's less risk of damaging them. And the iPad hasn't shown big leaps in performance in recent years, so people who already have an iPad see little reason to buy a new one.</p> \n<p>The iPad may also be hurt by the trend toward larger iPhones.

Why the NFL just gave up its nonprofit status: to escape scrutiny,http://www.vox.com/2015/4/28/8509767/nfl-tax-exempt-nonprofit,It's a calculated move â€” and a very small price to pay.,"<p>For years, the NFL's tax-exempt status has been the <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/tomwatson/2014/01/30/the-real-super-bowl-question-should-the-nfl-be-a-nonprofit/"">subject</a> of scrutiny and <a href=""http://www.slate.com/articles/business/moneybox/2014/09/the_nfl_should_lose_its_tax_exempt_status_the_league_is_not_a_nonprofit.html"">ridicule</a>. To many people, the fact that a league headed by a commissioner making <a href=""http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/shutdown-corner/roger-goodell-made-more-44-million-last-wait-211537621--nfl.html"">$44 million a year</a> was categorized as a nonprofit was absurd.</p> \n<p>On Tuesday, <a href=""http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2015-04-28/nfl-will-end-its-tax-exempt-status-goodell-tells-team-owners"">Richard Rubin at Bloomberg reports</a>,  the NFL has finally decided to shed its tax-exempt status. As a result, it will pay an estimated <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/business/wp/2015/04/28/the-nfl-is-dropping-its-tax-exempt-status-why-that-ends-up-helping-them-out/"">$10 million or so</a> per year in taxes.</p> \n<p>But it's important to put this number in the proper context: the league's teams pull in about <a href=""http://www.bloomberg.com/bw/articles/2014-09-12/if-the-nfl-were-a-real-business"">$9.5 billion per year</a>, which they pay taxes on. And since 2000, US taxpayers have spent an estimated <a href=""https://cbsminnesota.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/nfl-funding-summary-12-2-11.pdf"">$3.9 billion</a> on stadiums for these teams. The central league offices basically work as a distribution system, taking in just enough TV money to cover salaries and giving the rest out to teams.</p> \n<p>The NFL's decision to give up its tax-exempt status isn't some noble recognition of the tax burden it's unfairly been shirking. It's a calculated move to pay a relatively small fee to avoid scrutiny and preempt possible Congressional action.</p> \n<h3>How the NFL became tax-exempt</h3> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""3651716"" alt=""pete rozelle"" src=""https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3651716/103926479.0.jpg""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Pete Rozelle cut a deal with Congress for perpetual tax exemption in 1966. (Nate Fine/NFL)</p> \n<p>In 1942, the NFL — which was financially struggling, with many of its players off to <a href=""http://www.profootballhof.com/history/general/war/worldwar2/page2.aspx"">fight in World War II</a> — successfully filed for tax-exempt status from the IRS. The individual teams (which took in most of the income) still had to pay taxes. But the league itself, based in New York, became categorized as a trade association, which made it exempt.</p> \n<p>As the league became more profitable, this categorization<strong> </strong>grew increasingly important. Though the vast majority of profits continued to go to the teams, a bit did go to the league itself, and its tax-exempt categorization saved it some money.</p> \n<p>The tax status was important enough that in 1966, when the NFL was about to merge with the American Football League (which would become the AFC), then–Commissioner <a href=""http://www.cnn.com/2014/09/22/us/nfl-nonprofit-taxes/"">Pete Rozelle lobbied Congress</a> to make sure it'd stay that way. In exchange for putting a team in New Orleans, he got support from a pair of Louisiana lawmakers to put language into an unrelated bill that explicitly categorized football leagues as tax-exempt. (The bill also granted the new league antitrust protection.)</p> \n<p>As a result, here's how the <a href=""http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-tege/eotopick03.pdf"">section 501(c)6</a> of the tax code still reads today (bold emphasis is mine):</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>IRC 501(c)(6) provides for exemption of business leagues, chambers of commerce, real estate boards, boards of trade, <strong>and professional football leagues </strong>(whether or not administering a pension fund for football players), which are not organized for profit and no part of the net earnings of which inures to the benefit of any private shareholder or individual.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<h3>Why the NFL gave up its tax-exempt status</h3> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""3651726"" alt=""goodell 2"" src=""https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3651726/455039888.0.jpg""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">(Otto Greule Jr./Getty Images)</p> \n<p>This was a good deal for the league and saved it millions in taxes over the years. But recently it's attracted a lot of scrutiny, especially as the NFL's image has suffered and people have become more aware of the billions of dollars municipalities have spent on stadiums.</p> \n<p>In 2013, Oklahoma Senator <a href=""http://www.bloomberg.com/bw/articles/2013-09-19/a-republican-senator-s-lonely-mission-to-make-the-nfl-pay-taxes"">Tom Coburn introduced a bill</a> that would have stripped the NFL of its tax-exempt status. It didn't succeed, but it's been followed by similar efforts in the House. And other lawmakers have used the tax-exempt status as a point of leverage in investigating the <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/9/5/6106851/nfl-football-concussions"">NFL's mishandling of concussions</a>, among other issues.</p> \n<p>Apparently, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell and team owners decided the tax-exempt status was no longer worth it. In a Tuesday letter to Congress, Goodell called the issue a ""distraction"" and said that in March, the 32 team owners had voted to shed the league's tax-exempt status.</p> \n<p>This will cost them a bit of money: about $10 million or so per year. But at the same time, total revenues for all teams have risen to <a href=""http://www.bloomberg.com/bw/articles/2014-09-04/nfls-secretive-finances-a-nearly-10-billion-mystery"">nearly $10 billion</a> (because all but one of those teams are privately held, they don't have to publish their operating expenses and income). The teams pay a great deal in taxes, but the new taxes to be paid by the league offices are negligible.</p> \n<p>In exchange, the NFL will get a few big benefits. For one, lawmakers can no longer hold the league's tax-exempt status over it during hearings about unrelated issues. And it preempts a possible future move by Congress to strip the league of this status, which would have looked much worse to the public.</p> \n<p>But more important, filing as a taxable, privately held entity will mean that the NFL no longer has to disclose its income — or the oft-criticized salary of its commissioner, Goodell. As Andrew Brandt, an ESPN business analyst, <a href=""http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2015-04-28/nfl-will-end-its-tax-exempt-status-goodell-tells-team-owners"">told Bloomberg</a>, ""It seems like Congress has been making a big deal out of it. Without this status there’s no requirement to disclose, which helps in the PR battle.""</p> \n<h3>Watch: The NFL's concussion crisis, explained</h3> \n<!-- CHORUS_VIDEO_EMBED ChorusVideo:54746 -->",Business & Finance

To do so, they gave up their first pick this year, 19th overall.</p> \n<p>Watkins has had a solid start to his career.

But many teams, like the Bills, become overconfident in their evaluation of one particular player and do the opposite: they package several slightly lower picks for the right to take one player very early.</span></p> \n<p><!-- CHORUS_VIDEO_EMBED ChorusVideo:69966 --></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Watch: The history of the NFL draft, explained in 2 minutes</p> \n<h3>It's just not worth it to trade up</h3> \n<p><span>In their first paper, Massey and Thaler studied 1,078 draft pick trades made between </span><span>1990 and 2008. This let them determine the value teams got in return when they traded away each pick in the first five rounds of the draft:</span></p> \n<p><img src=""http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/assets/4408903/Screen_Shot_2014-05-05_at_12.55.38_PM.png"" class=""photo"" alt=""Screen_shot_2014-05-05_at_12.55.38_pm""></p> \n<p><a target=""_blank"" href=""http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=697121""></a></p> \n<p class=""caption"">(<a target=""_blank"" href=""http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=697121"">Massey and Thaler 2012</a>)</p> \n<p>The most important thing about this graph: the curve is very, very sharp in the first round. That means teams think the very top picks are <i>extremely</i> valuable: <span>the value of the 10th pick is only about half that of the first pick.</span></p> \n<p>Now, it's worth pointing out that for years, <span>most teams followed something called </span><a target=""_blank"" href=""http://walterfootball.com/draftchart.php"">""the Chart,""</a><span> which assigned values to each pick in the draft for trade purposes. Since </span><span>2008, many teams have smartly stopped treating the Chart as gospel, and the curve has become slightly less steep.</span></p> \n<p>But Massey says it still hasn't flattened out to anything near where it should be, in terms of the actual value derived from the players picked. <span>He and Thaler calculated this value based on the </span><span>odds that the first player picked at any given position will perform better — in terms of the number of games he starts in his first five seasons — than the second player drafted at that position. </span></p> \n<p><q class=""right"" aria-hidden=""true"">teams just aren't very good at figuring out who's the best player at any position</q></p> \n<p><span>Lots of teams, like the Bills, will trade up when they identify a player they prefer at a needed position: they need a wide receiver, and a few highly rated ones are available, but they trade up because they're </span><i>certain</i><span> Sammy Watkins is the best. </span><span>But the data says that teams just aren't very good at figuring out when this is true. </span></p> \n<p><span>On average, the chance that first player will start more games than the second one picked at his position: 52 percent. Compared with the third player, it's still only 55 percent, and compared with the fourth, it's just 56 percent.</span></p> \n<p>These numbers suggest that moving up eight picks (the average distance between the first and second players at the same position) should cost a small amount, since you're only increasing the odds of a getting a more productive player by 4 percent or so. But as the steep curve shows, teams pay a ton to move up, especially at the top of the draft.</p> \n<h3><span>It really pays off to trade down</span></h3> \n<p><span></span></p> \n<p><img alt=""470194287"" class=""photo"" src=""http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/assets/4410107/470194287.jpg""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Philip Rivers: just part of the valuable package the Giants gave up to take Eli Manning. (Christian Petersen/Getty Images)</p> \n<p>Given that some teams, like the Bills, are irrationally willing to pay a lot to trade up, smart teams can reap huge benefits by trading down. Even staying put and drafting from your original spot, the researchers' analysis shows, isn't the best strategy.</p> \n<p>For each pick in the first round, Massey and Thaler calculated all of the different two-pick packages a team could've gotten by trading down, based on the historical data (a team with the first pick, for instance, could get the second and 181st picks, or the 14th and 15th picks, or any combination of picks in between that provide the same sum value).</p> \n<p><q class=""right"" aria-hidden=""true"">staying put and drafting at your original position is not the best strategy either</q></p> \n<p>Then they calculated what teams have gotten out of these picks, on average, in terms of the number of starts a player picked at that spot has historically provided in his first five years, and the number of Pro Bowls he's voted to. (They included Pro Bowls to counter the criticism that their analysis ignores the unique impact of superstar players only available in the first few picks.)</p> \n<p>Again, the data was unequivocal. On average, trading down and getting two players gave a team five more starts per season and slightly more total Pro Bowls.</p> \n<p>You could chalk this up to the simple fact that more players start more games, but it's more than that. Even if you imagined that the team trading down could only keep the better one of the two players it drafted, it'd <i>still</i> get slightly more total starts and the same number of Pro Bowls. The truth is that teams are imperfect talent evaluators, so having two later picks is better than a single early one. It's just risk diversification at work.</p> \n<h3><span>Teams that trade down more often win more games</span></h3> \n<p>The most straightforward piece of proof for all this is the fact that trading down correlates with more wins on the field.</p> \n<p>Massey and Thaler came to this conclusion by looking at the number of wins a team had in any given season between 1997 and 2008, and the total value of all picks they'd made in the previous four years (the amount of time, on average, for which a rookie is under contract).</p> \n<p>They found that one standard deviation in pick value translated to 1.5 more wins per season on the field. Sure, it's a small sample size, and<span> there's a lot of chance and other factors built into the system, such as a coach's strategy. B</span><span>ut trading down correlates with a</span><span> significant amount of victories, given that there are only 16 games in a season.</span></p> \n<h3>So why don't more NFL teams follow this advice?</h3> \n<p><img alt=""174364155"" class=""photo"" src=""http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/assets/4410043/174364155.jpg""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Baltimore Ravens GM Ozzie Newsome knows how to draft. (Rob Tringali/SportsChrome/Getty Images)</p> \n<p><span>If all teams took note of these findings and corrected their behavior, the principles would no longer apply. Teams would be much less interested in trading up, so the lucrative market for trading down would evaporate.</span></p> \n<p>Why hasn't this happened? One answer is a widely known <span>psychological bias called the</span><span> </span><a href=""http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Overconfidence_effect"" target=""_blank"">overconfidence effect</a>. As people are given more information, the accuracy of their analysis often hits a ceiling, but their confidence in it continues to increase.</p> \n<p>This<span> tendency</span><span> has been</span><span> demonstrated in all sorts of areas, </span><span>from </span><a href=""http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF01132730"" target=""_blank"">bettors picking horses</a><span> to</span><a href=""http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/1965-12467-001"" target=""_blank""> psychologists making diagnoses</a><span>. It's not hard to imagine that NFL general managers — who are given scouting reports on players that cover everything from their body fat percentage to their home life — fall victim to the same sort of overconfidence.</span></p> \n<p><q class=""right"" aria-hidden=""true"">""[teams] fall in love with players, get more and more confident in their analysis""</q></p> \n<p>""In my experience, teams always say they're on board with [trading down] in January,"" Massey said. ""Then when April rolls around, and they've been preparing for the draft for a long time, they fall in love with players, get more and more confident in their analysis, and fall back into the same patterns.""</p> \n<p>There's also the fact that the sports world as a whole tends to glamorize superstars — leading many to disproportionately attribute a 53-player roster's success to one or two highly drafted players. For a struggling GM, it might seem easier to trade up and land a guaranteed superstar than to patiently fill a roster with competent players.</p> \n<p><span>The problem, though, is that there are no guaranteed superstars — and </span><span>Thaler and Massey </span><a href=""http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/sports/56913718-77/massey-draft-nfl-teams.html.csp"" target=""_blank"">have found</a><span> that, </span><span>given a long enough time frame, </span><span>no teams are any better at accurately evaluating prospects than others. </span><span>Sure, a GM might hit a hot streak over the course of a few drafts, but long term they </span><span>estimate that 95 to 100 percent of the difference in teams' odds of striking gold with any one pick</span><span> </span><span>is driven by chance.</span></p> \n<p>So the key isn't drafting better — it's just drafting more.</p> \n<p>As Massey noted, there are a few teams out there following his philosophy. In a<span> </span><a href=""http://mmqb.si.com/2014/05/01/2014-nfl-draft-baltimore-ravens-compensatory-picks/"" target=""_blank"">recent interview</a>,<span> Eric DeCosta — assistant GM of the </span>perennially successful<span> Baltimore Ravens — dropped a hint about the identity of one of them:</span></p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>We look at the draft as, in some respects, a luck-driven process. The more picks you have, the more chances you have to get a good player. When we look at teams that draft well, it’s not necessarily that they’re drafting better than anybody else. It seems to be that they have more picks. There’s definitely a correlation between the amount of picks and drafting good players.</p> \n</blockquote>",Business & Finance

Pacquiao was an undersized fighter who'd become a national hero in his native Philippines with a string of surprising upsets, including his own defeat of De La Hoya the year prior. The two boxers had become the sport's best-known figures, and their representatives <a href=""http://sports.yahoo.com/news/boxing--floyd-mayweather-and-manny-pacquiao-nearly-agreed-to-a-2010-fight.html"">reportedly</a> came close to agreeing on the terms for a marquee fight.</p> \n<p><q class=""right"" aria-hidden=""true"">there are no tournaments forcing top boxers to compete</q></p> \n<p>But boxing isn't like other sports. There are no playoffs or tournaments forcing the best teams or players to compete. Instead, boxers negotiate all the terms of a fight, much like political candidates hashing out the mundane details of a televised debate. And negotiations for the 2010 fight fell apart over drug testing: Mayweather reportedly wanted blood drawn the day before the fight, and Pacquiao, who claimed to be afraid of needles, wanted only urine testing during the 30 days before the bout. Mayweather <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://deadspin.com/5432509/mayweather-laughably-implies-pacquiao-is-doping"">accused him of doping</a>, and a <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://espn.go.com/boxing/story/_/id/8425747/floyd-mayweather-manny-pacquiao-settling-defamation-case"">defamation lawsuit ensued</a>.</p> \n<p>It took five more years — which included a pair of losses for Pacquiao — for the fight to finally happen. Now both boxers are in their late 30s, and many fans say they're well past their prime. Still, they're two of the best boxers in the world, and certainly the top two in their weight class (welterweight, which goes from 140 to 147 pounds).</p> \n<h3>$300 million</h3> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""3656984"" alt=""mayweather cast"" src=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3656984/76603769.0.jpg""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Mayweather, holding lots of cash.

Bitcoin's growing popularity in Argentina shows why it's not a fad,http://www.vox.com/2015/4/30/8521747/argentina-bitcoin-inflation-fad,Bitcoin provides a backstop in countries that suffer from high inflation and a dysfunctional banking system.,"<p>Americans like to talk about themselves, so when we talk about Bitcoin we usually focus on ways the technology can make life better for American consumers. But an <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/03/magazine/how-bitcoin-is-disrupting-argentinas-economy.html"">in-depth piece in the New York Times</a> illustrates why the currency could have a brighter future overseas. Nathaniel Popper describes a day he spent hanging out with an Argentine Bitcoin trader:</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p><span>That afternoon, a plump 48-year-old musician was one of several customers to drop by the rented room. A German customer had paid the musician in Bitcoin for some freelance compositions, and the musician needed to turn them into dollars. Castiglione joked about the corruption of Argentine politics as he peeled off five $100 bills, which he was trading for a little more than 1.5 Bitcoins, and gave them to his client. The musician did not hand over anything in return; before showing up, he had transferred the Bitcoins — in essence, digital tokens that exist only as entries in a digital ledger — from his Bitcoin address to Castiglione’s. Had the German client instead sent euros to a bank in Argentina, the musician would have been required to fill out a form to receive payment and, as a result of the country’s currency controls, sacrificed roughly 30 percent of his earnings to change his euros into pesos.</span></p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>The United States has a pretty good financial system; the dollar generally holds its value from one year to the next, people are generally free to exchange their dollars for foreign currencies at market exchange rates, and we don't worry about governments or banks suddenly confiscating our wealth.</p> \n<p>But some other countries have much worse financial systems. Argentina in particular has suffered from a <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/07/30/us-argentina-debt-chronology-idUSKBN0FZ23N20140730"">series of financial crises</a> that have made Argentines wary of the country's banking system. As the Times explains, the government has tried to fight inflation by enforcing an unrealistic exchange rate, which in practice operates as a huge tax on foreign transactions.</p> \n<p>As a result, Bitcoin looks a lot more attractive to people in Argentina. The Argentine government can't impose its arbitrary rules on the Bitcoin network, which operates all over the world. And <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/bitcoin/is-volatility-going-to-be-a-fatal-problem-for-bitcoin"">Bitcoin's volatility</a> seems less alarming in a country where double-digit inflation is a common occurrence.</p> \n<p>As Bitcoin takes root around the world, it will provide an effective floor on how terrible a country's financial system can get. In the past, when a country suffered from a bout of hyperinflation — as Argentina did in the 1980s — there wasn't much locals could do about it. Back then, it wasn't practical to use the American or German financial systems for everyday purchases in Argentina, and there was a limit to the number of dollars or Deutsche marks people could smuggle into the country.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""center"">Bitcoin will provide a floor on how terrible a country's financial system can get</q></p> \n<p>But it's easy for Argentines to use the Bitcoin network — all you need is an internet connection. So if the Argentine financial system gets more dysfunctional, Bitcoin will become more popular.</p> \n<p>And this is one reason Bitcoin is here to stay. Even if it never poses a serious threat to financial networks in rich countries, there will always be some countries around the world with dysfunctional financial systems. People in these countries will want unregulated ways to send money overseas, and they'll want ways to shelter their wealth from inflation and the kleptocratic tendencies of their governments. These users will generate demand for bitcoins for the foreseeable future.</p>",Business & Finance
Firefox has an audacious plan to pressure websites to use encryption,http://www.vox.com/2015/5/1/8525429/mozilla-firefox-ssl-deprecated,The browser is going to treat not using SSL encryption as a security flaw.,"<p>You might not have noticed, but many of the websites you visit have a big security flaw. Anything you upload or download can be intercepted by anyone who's listening in on your internet connection. And in today's wireless world, that can be a lot of people: your nosy neighbor, the guy sitting next to you at the coffee shop, or a foreign intelligence agency.</p> \n<p>Luckily, technologists have come up with a solution to this problem. In fact, they invented the solution in 1995. It's <span>an encryption technology called </span><a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/heartbleed/what-is-ssl"">SSL</a>. <span>Unfortunately, the people who run websites have been dragging their feet on using it.</span></p> \n<p>In the early years, there were good reasons for this. Encryption requires extra computing power, and servers in the 1990s didn't have much to spare. So the technology was only used by sites that really needed it — primarily banks and e-commerce companies accepting credit card payments.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""right""><span>The lack of SSL will be treated as a security flaw</span></q></p> \n<p>But today's servers are a <i>lot</i> faster. Google <a href=""https://istlsfastyet.com/"" target=""_blank"">estimates</a> that using SSL encryption only increases the load on its servers by about 1 percent. So a lack of computing power isn't a good excuse for not using SSL. A lot more websites use the technology today than did a decade ago. Yet there are still a lot of websites that don't use it.</p> \n<p>This is why a <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2015/04/30/deprecating-non-secure-http/"">new announcement</a> from Mozilla is such a big deal. The nonprofit company behind the popular Firefox web browser has decided that the lack of SSL will be treated as a security flaw.</p> \n<p>Mozilla is planning to back this determination up with some concrete actions — in the future, non-SSL websites won't have access to security-sensitive features such as your camera.</p> \n<p>But the move is also significant from a rhetorical point of view. Until now, SSL has generally been seen as an optional feature — something that's nice to have but not essential if you're not running a bank or e-commerce site. Mozilla is hoping to change the conversation, describing sites that don't support SSL as defective.</p> \n<p>This shift in terminology could help IT guys convince their bosses that this is an issue worth taking seriously. It's one thing to say, ""Hey, boss, I'd like to spend the next couple of weeks adding a new feature to our site that will make it more secure."" <span>It's another thing to say, ""Hey boss, major browsers think our site is broken. Can I take a couple of weeks to fix it?"" The change in vocabulary could shift SSL from being seen as a nice-to-have to a must-have. </span></p> \n<p><span>(Full disclosure: our boss at Vox Media agreed with our engineers about the need for SSL prior to the Mozilla decision, and we're working on a solution now.)</span></p> \n<p>And there's good reason to think this will work. Google, the company behind the industry-leading Chrome browser, is a <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/4/27/8503609/ssl-tls-security-privacy"" target=""_blank"">big SSL supporter</a>. Google is <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.chromium.org/Home/chromium-security/marking-http-as-non-secure"">considering taking a similar step</a> with Chrome, and has already started downgrading non-SSL sites in search results.</p> \n<p>Ultimately, this is good news for users everywhere. SSL doesn't just protect users from snooping, it also safeguards the integrity of websites, preventing intermediaries from <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/4/27/8503609/ssl-tls-security-privacy"">hijacking pages</a> for their own purposes. And with luck, we could soon live in a world where almost every website uses the technology.</p>",Business & Finance
The internet might transform commuting more than the self-driving car,http://www.vox.com/2015/5/5/8547831/telecommuting-traffic,5 million people work at home every day â€” a number that keeps on rising.,"<p><em>This post is part of a </em><a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/4/29/8513699/future-of-commuting""><em>series on the past, present, and future of commuting in America</em></a><em>.</em></p> \n<p>The technology that most profoundly changes US commuting might not be the <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/5/28/5756736/the-case-for-self-driving-cars"">self-driving car</a>.</p> \n<p>It could be the internet.</p> \n<p><q class=""right"" aria-hidden=""true"">traffic engineers already see reduced congestion on fridays</q></p> \n<p>Already, in many places, traffic engineers see notably reduced congestion on Fridays — a day when many offices let their workers telecommute from home. ""I've spoken with people from the Maryland Department of Transportation, and they say there's no question,"" says <a href=""http://alanpisarski.com/"">Alan Pisarski</a>, author of the <a href=""http://traveltrends.transportation.org/Pages/default.aspx""><em>Commuting in America</em></a><em> </em>report. ""On Fridays, you really see a difference in traffic coming down from the suburbs to DC on <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstate_270_%28Maryland%29"">I-270</a>.""</p> \n<p>This shift is part of a broader trend: the steady fragmentation of what used to be a relatively uniform pattern of commuting. A few decades ago, the standard commute was for a full-time, 9-to-5 shift. People living in the suburbs mostly drove into the city in the morning and back in the evening.</p> \n<p>But as more and more people work flexible hours, part-time jobs, or from home, the flood of commuters that used to fill highways during rush hour is becoming a stream that runs intermittently all day. Most suburban commuters, meanwhile, don't drive into the city — they drive to other suburbs.</p> \n<h3>Millions of people are now working at home</h3> \n<p>Census data shows that the percentage of people who work from home every day is rising quickly, more than doubling since 1980. It's still only 4.33 percent of workers, but that's more than 5 million workers — and is more than the number of people who walk or bike to work combined:</p> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3668598/chart_1.0.png"" alt=""working from home"" data-chorus-asset-id=""3668598""></p> \n<p>About <a href=""http://traveltrends.transportation.org/Documents/B6_Job%20Dynamic_CA4_web.pdf"">45 percent</a> of these workers are self-employed (with many working as freelancers or independent contractors), but a growing number of them are employed full-time in the private sector.</p> \n<p>These employers aren't letting them stay home because they're suddenly feeling charitable, but rather because technology now allows them to easily ensure employees are actually working — and because doing so can save businesses a lot of money.</p> \n<p>""The recession has also made companies more sensitive to operating costs,"" says <a href=""http://laup.arch.tamu.edu/people/profiles/tlomax/"">Tim Lomax</a>, a transportation researcher at Texas A&amp;M. ""If you can get someone to work from their home, where they don't need a parking space or an office, that reduces your cost of doing business.""</p> \n<h3>Millions of others are working alternate schedules</h3> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""3670132"" alt=""drivers"" src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3670132/469590478.0.jpg""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">(Mark Wilson/Getty Images)</p> \n<p>What's more, the census only asks about your normal everyday commute, so its numbers don't include the many people who work from home occasionally, or those with other sorts of alternative schedules.</p> \n<p>""More and more, people are working compressed schedules — say, with alternate Fridays off, or one or two days at home per week,"" Pisarski says. More people also work in fields that allow for varying schedules (like the health-care and service industries) than those that don't (like industry).</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, the number of people working part-time <a href=""http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/03/08/the-rise-of-part-time-work/"">has swelled since the start of the recession</a>, rising by <a href=""http://traveltrends.transportation.org/Documents/B6_Job%20Dynamic_CA4_web.pdf"">2.1 million</a> between 2005 and 2012. Increasing numbers of people, unable to find full-time work, are also combining multiple part-time jobs.</p> \n<p>All these trends have broken up the old, predictable traffic patterns of yore. They're the reason for the reduced traffic on Maryland's I-270 (and many other highways around the country) on Fridays, and they mean that the twice-daily surge of commuters we used to see during rush hour is increasingly being spread out to other parts of the day:</p> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3668606/chart_2.0.png"" alt=""commuting schedules"" data-chorus-asset-id=""3668606""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">(<a href=""http://traveltrends.transportation.org/Pages/default.aspx"">Commuting in America 2013</a>)</p> \n<h3>Most suburbanites are no longer commuting into the city</h3> \n<p>Another dominant pattern being disrupted is geographic. ""Our transportation system has basically been designed for radial service — getting people from the suburbs to the city center and back,"" says Pisarski. ""But that's not what's going on now, and it'll be even less so in the future.""</p> \n<p>Though some people commute from suburb to city, most suburbanites actually commute to other suburb areas within the same metro area. A decent fraction of city dwellers, meanwhile, commute out to the suburbs for work.</p> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3668610/chart_3.0.png"" alt=""commuting geography"" data-chorus-asset-id=""3668610""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">(<a href=""http://traveltrends.transportation.org/Pages/default.aspx"">Commuting in America 2013</a>)</p> \n<p>This shift began as early as the 1980s. Though many early suburbs were initially designed primarily as residential areas, businesses have increasingly chosen to locate in them for a few different reasons, including lower real estate costs.</p> \n<p>Additionally, the rise of households with multiple people working means that many families end up settling in compromise locations, halfway between a pair of distant jobs. This is why an increasing number of people (now about 27 percent of workers) cross county lines while commuting — and why several million people even end up commuting to other metro areas every day.</p> \n<h3>Increasingly, different cities have different commuting patterns</h3> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""3670136"" alt=""denver"" src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3670136/477661797.0.jpg""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">(Denver Post photo by Cyrus McCrimmon)</p> \n<p>One final pattern being disrupted is the general uniformity of commuting across the country. It used to be that most US cities were pretty similar — in terms of the modes of transportation people chose, the geographical patterns of commuting that went on, rates of growth, and other variables.</p> \n<p>But that's changing. ""In some strong urban markets with particular lifestyles and cultures, or better transit — say, Boulder, Colorado, or San Francisco — we're seeing one set of trends,"" says <a href=""http://ce.eng.usf.edu/facultyandstaff/stevePolzin.htm"">Steve Polzin</a>, a transportation researcher, ""and in a place like Oklahoma City, we're not seeing them at all.""</p> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3668612/chart_4.0.png"" alt=""commuting by region"" data-chorus-asset-id=""3668612""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">(<a href=""http://traveltrends.transportation.org/Pages/default.aspx"">Commuting in America 2013</a>)</p> \n<p>Polzin notes that between the 2000 and 2010 census counts, about a third of the counties nationwide had declining population, while another third grew explosively — accounting for 90 percent of the country's population growth.</p> \n<p>For the planners trying to figure out the highways, transit, and other infrastructure projects we'll need in the future, this presents a big challenge. It means that even within the same region, one city might have a lack of jobs and lots of underused infrastructure, while another might have a shortage of infrastructure and plenty of jobs.</p> \n<p>As Pisarski puts it, ""It's harder and harder to talk about 'national trends' in commuting.""</p>",Business & Finance

""By the time National City Lines was buying up these streetcar companies, they were already in bankruptcy.""</p> \n<p>Surprisingly, though, streetcars didn't solely go bankrupt because people chose cars over rail. The real reasons for the streetcar's demise are much less nefarious than a GM-driven conspiracy — they include gridlock and city rules that kept fares artificially low — but they're fascinating in their own right, and if you're a transit fan, they're even more frustrating.</p> \n<h3>The golden age of the streetcar</h3> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3676884/54-6-5.8.0.jpg"" alt=""grand rapids"" data-chorus-asset-id=""3676884""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Electrified streetcars in Grand Rapids, Michigan. (<a href=""http://www.historygrandrapids.org/photo/814/streetcar-parade"">Grand Rapids Historical Society</a>)</p> \n<p>During the 1800s, animal-drawn streetcar lines were built in cities across the United States. Starting in the 1880s, they were replaced by electrified streetcars, which quickly became the dominant mode of transportation in many cities.</p> \n<p>Running streetcars was a very profitable business. Cities expanded, and people who found themselves living too far from work to walk depended on them. (Some real-estate developers <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streetcar_suburb"">built nearby suburbs</a> around streetcar lines.) Over time, the businessmen who ran the streetcars, called <a href=""http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9907E7DB1639E333A2575AC1A9659C946997D6CF"">""traction magnates,""</a> consolidated ownership of multiple lines, establishing powerful, oftentimes corrupt monopolies in many cities.</p> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3675996/Streetcars_Atlanta_1902.0.jpg"" alt=""atlanta streetcar"" data-chorus-asset-id=""3675996""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">In 1902, Atlanta had an extensive streetcar network. (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Streetcars_Atlanta_1902.jpg"">Georgia Railway and Electric Company</a>)</p> \n<p>Eventually, many of them contracted with city governments for the explicit right to operate as a monopoly in that city. In exchange, they agreed to all sorts of conditions. ""Eager to receive guarantees on their large up-front investments, streetcar operators agreed to contract provisions that held fares constant at five cents and mandated that rail line owners maintain the pavement around their tracks,"" <a href=""http://marketurbanism.com/2010/09/23/the-great-american-streetcar-myth/"">writes Stephen Smith at Market Urbanism</a>.</p> \n<p>Until the start of World War I, these conditions weren't a huge problem. But soon afterward, they became excessively onerous — because even though these companies were making sacrifices to act as monopolies, they were no longer operating as them.</p> \n<h3>What really killed the streetcar: gridlock and artificially low fares</h3> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3676904/HP-JRW-STREETCAR-1.0.jpg"" alt=""fresno"" data-chorus-asset-id=""3676904""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">A Fresno streetcar stuck in traffic, in 1938. (<a href=""http://historical.fresnobeehive.com/2010/05/fresno-street-cars/"">Fresno Beehive</a>)</p> \n<p>The decline of the streetcar after World War I — when cars began to arrive on city streets — is often cast as a simple choice made by consumers. As a <a href=""http://amhistory.si.edu/onthemove/exhibition/exhibition_4_6.html"">Smithsonian exhibition puts it</a>, ""Americans chose another alternative — the automobile. The car became the commuter option of choice for those who could afford it, and more people could do so.""</p> \n<p>But the reality is more complicated. ""People weren't choosing to ride or not ride in some perfect universe — they were making it in a messy, real-world environment,"" Norton says.</p> \n<p>The real problem was that once cars appeared on the road, they could drive on streetcar tracks — and the streetcars could no longer operate efficiently. ""Once just 10 percent or so of people were driving, the tracks were so crowded that [the streetcars] weren't making their schedules,"" Norton says.</p> \n<p><q class=""right"" aria-hidden=""true"">cars could drive on streetcar tracks — so they slowed them down dramatically</q></p> \n<p>In some places, like Chicago, streetcars retained dedicated rights of way, and they survived. Pretty much anywhere else, they were doomed. ""With 160,000 cars cramming onto Los Angeles streets in the 1920s, mass-transit riders complained of massive traffic jams and hourlong delays,"" writes <a href=""http://articles.latimes.com/2003/mar/23/local/me-then23"">Cecilia Rasmussen at the Los Angeles Times</a>.</p> \n<p>What's more, in many cities the streetcars' contracts required them to keep the pavement on the roads surrounding the tracks in good shape. This meant that the companies were effectively subsidizing automobile travel even as it cannibalized their business.</p> \n<p>And paying for this maintenance got more and more difficult for one key reason: many contracts had permanently locked companies into a 5-cent fare, which wasn't indexed to inflation.</p> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3676922/DSC00187.0.JPG"" alt=""five cent token"" data-chorus-asset-id=""3676922""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">(<a href=""http://www.city-data.com/forum/phoenix-area/192459-how-do-you-remember-phoenix-stories-566.html"">City-data.com</a>)</p> \n<p>Especially after World War I, the value of 5 cents plummeted, but streetcars had to get approval from municipal commissions for any fare hikes — and the idea of the 5-cent fare had become ingrained as something of a birthright among many members of the public. ""Nobody on these commissions would approve fare increases to cover costs, because that would get them in trouble with their constituents,"" Norton says.</p> \n<p>The public had little sympathy for the traction magnates who'd entered into these contracts. Today, many progressives and urbanists are boosters of streetcars, but back then they were often seen as a bastion of corruption — especially because of their owners' history of <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis_streetcar_strike_of_1900"" style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.65;"">violent strike-breaking</a>.</p> \n<h3>The quiet death of the streetcar</h3> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3675984/Pacific-Electric-Red-Cars-Awaiting-Destruction.0.jpg"" alt=""decommissioned streetcars"" data-chorus-asset-id=""3675984""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Decommissioned streetcars awaiting destruction in Los Angeles, 1956. (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Pacific-Electric-Red-Cars-Awaiting-Destruction.gif"">Los Angeles Times <br>photographic archive</a>)</p> \n<p>Because of these factors, some streetcar companies began going into bankruptcy as early as the 1920s, when they were still their cities' dominant mode of transportation. Huge costs and the falling value of fares forced them to cut back on service, steadily pushing people to the convenient, increasingly affordable automobile.</p> \n<p>As they fought to stay alive during the Great Depression, many companies invested in buses, which were cheaper and more flexible. Initially they operated mainly as feeder systems to bring commuters to the end of lines, but as time went on, they began to replace some lines entirely.</p> \n<p>That wasn't enough to save most of these companies, especially as city, state, and federal governments pumped more and more money into roads. ""By the '50s, planners put a priority on bringing cars into cities with new urban highways,"" Norton says. ""That really made streetcars truly impractical to get around on.""</p> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3676928/dsr092-c.0.jpg"" alt=""detroit streetcar"" data-chorus-asset-id=""3676928""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">One of Detroit's final streetcars, shown as part of a special parade in 1956. (<a href=""http://www.detroittransithistory.info/Text/DetroitPCC-5-text.html"">Dave's Electric Railroads —Stephen M. Scalzo collection</a>)</p> \n<p>By the 1950s, virtually all streetcar companies were in terrible shape. Some were taken over by new municipal bus companies, while a total of <a href=""http://articles.latimes.com/2003/mar/23/local/me-then23/2"">46 transit networks</a> were bought up by National City Lines — the holding company linked to GM, as well as oil and tire companies, that's at the center of all the conspiracy theories.</p> \n<p>While it's true that National City continued ripping up lines and replacing them with buses — and that, long-term, GM benefited from the decline of mass transit — it's very hard to argue that National City killed the streetcar on its own. Streetcar systems went bankrupt and were dismantled in virtually every metro area in the United States, and National City was only involved in <a href=""http://books.google.com/books?id=lZ6Kke0MZWwC&amp;hl=en"">about 10 percent</a> of cases.</p> \n<p>It's also not exactly right to say the streetcar died because Americans chose the car. In an alternate world where government subsidized each mode equally, it's easy to imagine things playing out quite differently.</p> \n<p>So what killed the streetcar? The simplest answer is that it couldn't compete with the car — on an extremely uneven playing field.</p>",Business & Finance

Norway has <a href=""http://www.newrepublic.com/article/119343/impact-quotas-corporate-gender-equality"">quotas mandating that women be represented on corporate boards</a> and parental leave policies that are both generous and <a href=""http://mic.com/articles/87983/norway-has-found-a-solution-to-the-gender-wage-gap-that-america-needs-to-try"">optimized to ensure men participate in child-rearing</a>. It also has a higher share of its workforce in the public sector, and even in the US the public sector pay gap is smaller than in the private sector.</p> \n<p>And even the Norwegians have stepped away from radical transparency somewhat. It used to be that the database was free and open, leading newspapers and other media organizations to create sites where you could browse salary data anonymously. Now you need to log in, and the system is two-way transparent, meaning you can see who's been creeping on your salary data.</p> \n<p>Still, even in its current form Norwegian transparency is light-years ahead of any Twitter bot — creating a system that doesn't just change the conversation but that actually lets people rigorously research pay equity questions and find unambiguous proof when they're undervalued by their employer.</p>",Business & Finance

7 key facts about austerity and the UK election,http://www.vox.com/2015/5/8/8572961/austerity-uk-election,Paul Krugman debunked? Not quite.,"<p>The British Conservative Party, led by David Cameron, swept to a <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/5/8/8572201/uk-election-results"" target=""_blank"">surprisingly robust victory this week</a>, securing an overall majority of parliamentary seats and a large advantage in total votes over the Labour Party at a time when polls indicated that neither was remotely likely.</p> \n<p>For Americans who have followed British politics primarily through the lens of American Keynesians complaining that Cameron's austerity policies destroyed the British economy, the results may come as a bit of a shock. Is the UK economy actually doing great? Was Paul Krugman wrong about everything?</p> \n<p>The truth is more complicated than that. Team Austerity didn't do as well as a superficial read of the returns would suggest — the UK economy is in some ways struggling, the austerity question itself was considerably more complicated than the US media debate about it suggested, and fundamentally the biggest issue in the UK economy has nothing at all to do with austerity or overspending.</p> \n<h3><span>1) Cameron triumphed, but his coalition flopped</span></h3> \n<p>To set the table, it's important to understand what actually happened in the 2015 election. Back in 2010, Cameron's Conservative Party scored 36 percent of the vote and 306 seats in Parliament. That made it by far the largest party, but left it short of a majority. Rather than lead a minority government that would have to try to cobble together majorities on a case-by-case basis, Cameron formed a coalition with the third-place Liberal Democrats — a centrist party that had won 23 percent of the vote and 57 seats.</p> \n<div id=""uk_elections_2010_vs_2015""></div> \n<p> \n<script type=""text/javascript""><!-- \nwindow.pym || document.write( '<scr' + 'ipt src=""http://apps.voxmedia.com/tools/javascripts/vendor/pym-cb3d02c4.js""></scr' + 'ipt>' ); \n// --></script> \n<script type=""text/javascript""><!-- \nvar uk_elections_2010_vs_2015 = new pym.Parent( ""uk_elections_2010_vs_2015"", ""http://apps.voxmedia.com/tools/charts-public/?labels=Conservatives%2CLabour%2CLiberal%20Democrats&datasets=36%2C29%2C23%7C37%2C31%2C8&title=UK%20elections%202010%20vs%202015&description=Lib%20Dem%20collapse%2C%20Tories%20don't%20surge&source=BBC&link=http%3A%2F%2Fnews.bbc.co.uk%2F2%2Fshared%2Felection2010%2Fresults%2F&type=bar&legend=2010%2C2015"", { xdomain: "".*.voxmedia.com"" } ); \n// --></script> \n</p> \n<p>In 2015, the Conservatives won 37 percent of the vote, and the Liberal Democrats won 8 percent.</p> \n<p>The total vote count of the austerity coalition, in other words, collapsed. And the popularity of Labour rose by a slightly larger amount than the popularity of the Conservatives.</p> \n<p>The unpopularity of the austerity coalition is precisely what makes the defeat so crushing for Labour. People were not in love with the incumbent government, and the opposition had a clear chance to take over. But rather than win the votes of the disaffected, Labour watched opposition scatter — with votes heading to regional separatist parties, to the UK Independence Party, and to basically everywhere except the main opposition party.</p> \n<h3>2) The UK economy struggled badly in Cameron's first years</h3> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""3680334"" alt=""fredgraph.0.png"" src=""https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3680334/fredgraph.0.png""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">UK vs. US GDP.</p> \n<p>In 2010 through 2013, the overall UK economy really was performing quite poorly. These were hardly the best of times in the United States, but our economy was clearly growing. The UK, having crashed massively and then bounced back under Gordon Brown, witnessed a slowdown and a prolonged period during which total GDP remained below its pre-crisis level. But things began to pick up in the subsequent years.</p> \n<p>Recent UK economic performance hasn't been stellar, but it's been totally fine — good enough for Cameron to hang on to those who supported him in 2010. But note that the UK continues to lag well behind the US in its recovery. Most research indicates that voters care more about rates of change than absolute levels, and Cameron's win seems to confirm that.</p> \n<h3>3) UK austerity was front-loaded</h3> \n<p>The coalition's controversial argument was that the British budget deficit needed to be reduced right away, rather than leaving the work of fiscal consolidation to come some time after economic recovery was underway.</p> \n<p>This meant that the austerity mostly happened in the early years of Cameron's government. That's the <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/business/ng-interactive/2015/apr/29/the-austerity-delusion"" target=""_blank"">centerpiece of Paul Krugman's explanation</a> for the good years — they happened because austerity was largely over.</p> \n<h3>4) The UK has had a jobs boom</h3> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""3680354"" alt=""lms-july-14-gif.0.gif"" src=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3680354/lms-july-14-gif.0.gif""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">UK employment level. (<a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/news/employment-rate-matches-record-high"" target=""_blank"">UK government</a>)</p> \n<p>But while UK GDP growth went from bad to okay, UK employment growth has actually been extremely robust.</p> \n<p>Not only has the unemployment rate fallen (as in the US), but the total number of people employed has soared as participation in the labor force has increased. A fair amount of this has to do with the coalition's policies, which have not simply been austere (i.e., focused on cutting the budget deficit) but are specifically focused on cutting social assistance spending and thereby encouraging people to go out and accept low-paid jobs.</p> \n<p>The interesting macroeconomic achievement here is that the UK economy has been able to absorb all these additional workers despite mediocre growth.</p> \n<h3>5) Monetary policy has been expansionary</h3> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""3680480"" alt=""fredgraph-1.0.png"" src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3680480/fredgraph-1.0.png""></p> \n<p>In the UK, as in the United States, the central bank has attempted to boost the economy with rounds of quantitative easing.</p> \n<p>Unlike in the United States, this expansionary stance has including willingness to run an inflation rate of more than 2 percent for a period of <i>years</i>. This had the effect of substantially driving down average real wages, which helped a bunch of new workers find jobs amid a slumping economy.</p> \n<h3>6) The big austerity debate is about the past</h3> \n<p>Regardless of what you think of David Cameron, it looks clear that the United Kingdom is not <i>currently</i> in a severe labor market recession. That means that on a forward-looking basis, there are no real grounds for an ongoing austerity debate.</p> \n<p>The real debate concerns the past. Cameron and his coalition partner Nick Clegg say that had they not moved to swift fiscal consolidation in the past, the United Kingdom would have been at risk of a Greek-style financial market panic and total meltdown.</p> \n<p>It is difficult, in practice, to see how this would have happened. A loss of investor confidence in the fiscal position of the government would have resulted in a falling value of the pound and an expansion/inflationary monetary environment. A falling pound and an expansionary/inflationary monetary environment are exactly what the UK got under austerity. On the other hand, the success of the Bank of England in achieving an expansionary monetary environment in the context of fiscal austerity suggests that fears of austerity crushing the economy were also somewhat misplaced.</p> \n<p>Austerity was neither necessary to avoid a meltdown nor sufficient to wreck the labor market. It was simply a policy choice to emphasize small government, less spending, and more employment in the private service sector rather than a more expansive welfare state with more public sector employment.</p> \n<h3>7) Britain's big economic challenge is housing</h3> \n<p>The current economic challenge facing the UK, then, is not unemployment but low wages and low productivity. How to increase wages and productivity is, in general, a very deep and difficult economic policy question. But in the specific case of the United Kingdom, it's actually relatively simple.</p> \n<p>You see, in the UK productivity is massively higher in greater London and the nearby Southeast than anywhere else in the country:</p> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""3680578"" alt=""CEfAJCeXIAA8gcv.png-large.0.png"" src=""https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3680578/CEfAJCeXIAA8gcv.png-large.0.png""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">(<a href=""https://fullfact.org/economy/london_productivity_rest_uk-31237"">Full Fact</a>)</p> \n<p>If more people moved from the low-productivity regions to London and the Southeast, productivity and wages would rise.</p> \n<p>So why don't they? Well, as a recent <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://cep.lse.ac.uk/pubs/download/EA033.pdf"">Center for Economic Policy analysis</a> explained, ""In 2014, UK house prices per square metre were the second highest in the world (topped only by Monaco), with especially high valuations in London and the South East. New houses are about 40% smaller than in similarly densely populated European countries.""</p> \n<p>This is because it is very difficult to get permission to build new houses in these high-cost areas: ""The UK's planning system is the main cause of the affordability crisis, especially in London and the South East.""</p> \n<p>If the UK revised its planning rules to allow for more construction in the most expensive areas, real wages would increase through three mechanisms:</p> \n<ol> \n<li><span>Construction jobs pay more than service sector jobs.</span></li> \n<li><span>Cheaper houses would increase real wages by lowering the cost of living.</span></li> \n<li><span>New arrivals to London and the Southeast would become more productive.</span></li> \n</ol> \n<p>This agenda of housing liberalization was not on the agenda of any major party in the 2015 election and appears very unlikely. But productivity has become the main problem in the UK economy, and housing reform is the key to unlocking it.</p>",Business & Finance

Verizon is buying AOL for its video content and ad technology,http://www.vox.com/2015/5/12/8590829/verizon-buys-aol,"The deal is about ad tech, not content.","<p> </p> \n<ol> \n<li><span>Verizon will buy AOL for $4.4 billion, or $50 a share, the company announced Tuesday morning. </span></li> \n<li><span>That's a significant premium over AOL's current price, and its stock rose 17 percent on the announcement.</span></li> \n<li><span>AOL is best-known for its content brands, including the Huffington Post and TechCrunch, and the PR around the deal emphasizes content.</span></li> \n<li><span>But savvy industry observers think Verizon is more interested in AOL's smaller but fast-growing ad technology business.</span></li> \n</ol> \n<h3>AOL/Verizon as a content play</h3> \n<p><a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.verizon.com/about/news/verizon-acquire-aol"" style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.65;"">Announcing the deal</a>, Verizon said the acquisition ""further drives its LTE wireless video and OTT (over-the-top video) strategy.""</p> \n<p>Un-jargoned, that means video that Verizon Wireless subscribers can access on their phones, and streaming video that cord-cutting Verizon wired Internet (via DSL or Fios) can watch without a cable television subscription.</p> \n<p>Similarly, in a <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.theverge.com/2015/5/12/8590543/verizon-aol-acquisition"">memo to staff, AOL CEO Tim Armstrong</a> wrote that ""Verizon will propel AOL and comes to the table with over 100 million mobile consumers, content deals with the likes of the NFL, and a meaningful strategy in mobile video.""</p> \n<p>On that account, this is basically a content acquisition. AOL's portfolio of media brands — which includes the Huffington Post and other things that don't have AOL logos slapped on them — produce videos that could be delivered to Verizon customers through Verizon's infrastructure, allowing Verizon to either charge a premium relative to competitors or extract extra value through ad sales.</p> \n<h3>This is a lot to pay for content</h3> \n<p>Verizon making a content deal makes some sense. But the price paid here seems awfully high. As a professional content man myself, I don't want to devalue what content brings to the table. But the price offered here is more than the *combined* valuation of BuzzFeed and the New York Times, which sounds like a much more formidable content portfolio.</p> \n<p>That said, one asset AOL brings to the table that no other media company has is its ridiculous legacy dial-up business. There is absolutely no point to buying dial-up internet from AOL, but a cohort of confused individuals do it anyway, and this brings in profits. Given the nonexistent growth potential in this business, nobody is going to buy AOL because of the subscriptions, but from a valuation point of view the revenue is real, which means you have to pay for it.</p> \n<p>That explains some of the premium here, but it's still a bit fishy.</p> \n<h3>The deal could be about ad technology</h3> \n<p>The answer to the riddle probably lies in something the press releases didn't really deal with: <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://adage.com/article/digital/aol-takes-form-ad-tech-charge/296405/"">AOL's growing ad tech business</a>, which lets advertisers automate ad buying and distribution.</p> \n<p>If Verizon could integrate really good mobile ad targeting technology with its wireless infrastructure, it could conceivably gain a huge leg up on the competition. In effect, Verizon would derive more revenue from a Verizon subscriber than AT&amp;T draws from an AT&amp;T subscriber. That would let Verizon undercut rivals on price and create a flywheel where the growing size of Verizon's customer base increases the value of its ad platform, which makes it economical to drive further aggressive expansion of the mobile business.</p> \n<p>There are a bunch of ways that could go wrong, but I could see talking myself into it.</p> \n<h3>More deals could be in the works</h3> \n<p>If Verizon isn't that interested in AOL's content brands, that of course raises questions about their ultimate disposition. <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://recode.net/2015/05/12/aol-in-talks-to-spin-off-huffpost-as-part-of-acquisition-deal/"">Kara Swisher reports for Re/Code</a> that the German publishing company Axel Springer is in talks to buy the Huffington Post for $1 billion, and in an <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://recode.net/2015/05/12/verizon-buys-aol-for-4-4-billion/"">interview with Re/Code</a>, AOL's Armstrong alluded to potential future sales of some elements of AOL's content business.</p> \n<p>""We've spoken to partners about content and scaling,"" he said.

Stop using income as a guide to economic class,http://www.vox.com/2015/5/12/8592689/income-class,"$50,000 a year could be a lot or a little depending on how old you are.","<p>Amy Chozick has a fascinating story about politicians <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/12/us/politics/as-middle-class-fades-so-does-use-of-term-on-campaign-trail.html?_r=0"">struggling to find a vocabulary</a> to describe families who are not <em>poor</em> but who feel their economic struggles are sufficiently severe that they no longer self-identify as middle-class. I don't have any advice to offer political wordsmiths, but the discussion is a good a reminder that household income is a pretty poor indication of a person's place in the American class structure.</p> \n<p>This is too bad, because people like to talk about household income for a reason. It's great to have a summary statistic of people's economic situation, and household incomes invite easy comparison. We can tell which quintile you fall into. We can tell whether you are above average locally or nationally. We can even compare you to a German or Mexican household. It's great.</p> \n<p>Except that it's terrible. Consider.</p> \n<h3>Three average households</h3> \n<p>The median household income in the United States is about $52,000. So go ahead and picture a median-income household. What did you picture?</p> \n<p>Did you picture a 25-year-old with a decent job who's maybe worried about student loans but is basically doing okay? Or did you picture a married pair of 45-year-olds who are both full-time workers stuck in kinda crappy jobs? Or did you picture a married couple with one full-time worker and one stay-at-home mom? Or a 65-year-old retiree whose $2.5 million stock portfolio yields him $52,000 a year in dividend income?</p> \n<p>These people are all in very different situations. But household income says they are all the same. In fact, it says they are all <em>typical households</em> earning the US median household income.</p> \n<h3>Two dentists</h3> \n<p>Or consider two affluent dentists who earned the exact same (large) amount of money over decades of practice in Washington, DC. Both always maintained a high household savings rate, and both are now retired. For one dentist, that currently manifests itself in a Dupont Circle townhouse that's matched with a beach place on the Outer Banks and a ski cabin.</p> \n<p>The other dentist sold his Dupont Circle townhouse and moved to a much cheaper place in Arizona. He doesn't own any vacation houses. Instead he's got a much larger stock portfolio, which helps pay for his country club membership and frequent travel to different places around the world.</p> \n<p>These people are in essentially the same situation, and simply have different consumption tastes. One finds comfort in a stable routine — rotating among three great homes he owns and has set up exactly to his specification — while the other favors variety. But because the imputed rent (i.e., the rent that you would have had to pay to use the houses if you didn't own them) on the three houses doesn't count as income, household income will say they are in very different circumstances.</p> \n<h3>Three 22-year-olds</h3> \n<p>Last, consider three 22-year-olds.</p> \n<p>One just graduated with a computer science degree from Stanford, where his parents covered his tuition, and has just taken a low-paid gig on Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign. The other just graduated with a debt-financed marketing degree from Schreiner University in Kerrville, Texas, and got a job with an electrical supply company. Last, you have a guy whose English isn't great because he was already 14 when he moved to the US and who works long hours at a CVS.</p> \n<p>It's entirely possible that the first guy has the lowest income, and extremely likely that the second guy has the lowest net worth. But because of ""human capital"" — the value of fancy sheepskin, the value of computer skills, the value of social connections, etc. — it's the first guy who ranks highest in the class pecking order and the third guy who ranks third.</p> \n<h3>Pay attention to life-cycle effects and net worth</h3> \n<p>In any discussion of a broad social phenomenon, a little loss of precision is necessary. But the key things to keep in mind about household income and class are that you always need to supplement with life-cycle analysis and net worth<em> — </em>especially housing wealth, where otherwise similar people are often in very different situations.</p> \n<p>Of course, sometimes ignoring life-cycle effects is appropriate. When you're talking about Affordable Care Act subsidies, the question of blunt ability to pay for insurance is very relevant. Consequently, the question of whether a 27-year-old earning $40,000 a year is ""really"" poorer than a 47-year-old earning $45,000 a year isn't the issue.</p> \n<p>But if you're looking for an analysis of the structure of social class in the United States, you really need to know about where people are in life.</p>",Business & Finance

This was done so World Cup games could be spread across the entire country, instead of just the southeast, where most of the top pro teams play. It's as if we built gleaming new stadiums in Montana and Alaska for hosting a World Cup in the US.</p> \n<p>In Brazil, this plan has left some pretty useless, expensive facilities scattered across the country, because these minor local teams don't sell enough tickets to make playing in the fancy (and expensive-to-maintain) stadiums worthwhile. The rainforest city of Manaus, for instance, is home to a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arena_da_Amaz%C3%B4nia"">$600 million stadium</a> that was used for exactly four World Cup games. The pro team there currently plays in much smaller training centers, because it'd lose money if it tried to rent out the big stadium.</p> \n<p>Many cities have been selling the stadiums to private companies that try to squeeze a bit of revenue out of them, but it's not easy. In Natal, <a href=""http://www.npr.org/blogs/parallels/2015/05/11/405955547/brazils-world-cup-legacy-includes-550m-stadium-turned-parking-lot"">the NPR story reports</a>, a company bought the stadium, but has made little money renting it out for children's birthday parties and weddings, and the facility is now for sale once again.</p> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""3689956"" alt=""arena das dunas"" src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3689956/Arena_das_Dunas__Natal__Brazil.0.jpg""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Arena das Dunas, built in Natal for $130 million, is being used for parties and weddings.

4 facts everyone should know about train accidents,http://www.vox.com/2015/5/13/8598703/amtrak-derailment-train-safety,"Train travel is much, much safer than driving.","<p>The <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/5/12/8596341/Philadelphia-Amtrak-Derailment"">derailment of an Amtrak train</a> Tuesday night in Philadelphia has killed at least six people and injured dozens more.</p> \n<p>We <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://bigstory.ap.org/article/ebc621a9cd1b4abd9f2bf2b50fa12d05/latest-amtrak-crash-ntsb-crew-heads-derailment"">still don't know the cause</a> of the accident. But we do know some basic facts about train safety that can help put it in context.</p> \n<h3>1) Train travel is much safer than other forms of travel</h3> \n<p>Train accidents are terrifying, and <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/5/13/8598531/amtrak-crash-car-accident"" target=""_blank"">get lots of public attention</a> when they occur. But the truth is that — <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/3/26/8295403/plane-crashes-germanwings"">just like plane travel</a> — on a per-mile basis, riding on a train is much safer than in a car.</p> \n<p>The <a href=""http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0739885912002156"">most recent comparison study</a>, conducted in 2013 by economist <a href=""http://faculty.wcas.northwestern.edu/~ipsavage/"">Ian Savage</a>, compared fatality rates for several different forms of travel in the US.</p> \n<p>The number of rail deaths from year to year ranges widely (because many can happen in large, sporadic accidents), but between 2000 and 2009, a person was about 17 times more likely to die while traveling in a car, compared to a train, for the same distance:</p> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""3693440"" alt=""train fatalities new"" src=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3693440/train-safetyv2.0.png""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">(Javier Zarracina/Vox)</p> \n<h3>2) Derailments are fairly common — but most are relatively harmless</h3> \n<p>Across the US, trains derail more often than you might think — last year, for instance, there were a total of <a href=""http://safetydata.fra.dot.gov/officeofsafety/publicsite/Query/inccaus.aspx"">1,241 derailments</a>. But the majority of them cause no injuries or deaths, and often only cause damage to the cargo they're carrying.</p> \n<p>This is partly because just a <a href=""http://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2013/08/economist-explains-18"">slim minority</a> of US trains carry passengers (most carry freight), and because most trains cars are designed to survive some level of impact. Additionally, most miles of track are in relatively rural, unpopulated places.</p> \n<p>The <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2015/05/13/why-amtrak-trains-derail/"">Washington Post highlights</a> a good analogy on this, which comes from George Bibel's book <a href=""https://books.google.com/books?id=5mKefpEufkgC&amp;q=derail#v=onepage&amp;q=derail&amp;f=true""><em>Train Wreck: The Forensics of Rail Disasters</em></a><em>: </em></p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>Most derailments are relatively benign, and can be compared to a person walking down the street, tripping, getting back up, and continuing on her or his way. Unless derailed cars crash into houses, strike passenger trains, or release hazardous material into a neighborhood, derailments do not normally affect civilians.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<h3>3) Derailments have been getting less common over time</h3> \n<p>Bibel also notes that derailments have become dramatically less common over the years, with a huge dip in the annual rate in the 1980s:</p> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""3692862"" alt=""derailment decline"" src=""https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3692862/Screen_Shot_2015-05-13_at_9.17.51_AM.0.png""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">(<a href=""https://books.google.com/books/about/Train_Wreck.html?id=5mKefpEufkgC&amp;hl=en"">George Bibel</a>)</p> \n<p>There's been a similar dip in fatalities per passenger mile, <a href=""http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0739885912002156"" target=""_blank"">Savage has found</a>.</p> \n<p>The decline was mainly caused by improvements in technology that were implemented after the freight industry was heavily <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staggers_Rail_Act"">deregulated in 1980</a>, allowing companies to turn a profit, so they could invest more in track and new equipment.</p> \n<p>Years ago, for instance, engineers were required to <a href=""http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2013/12/train_derailments_have_drastically_declined_but_danger_always_there.html"">manually spot track signals</a> and stop their trains to prevent collisions. Nowadays, automated systems do that, as well as <a href=""http://www.omaha.com/money/even-as-derailments-decline-pressure-on-the-rail-industry-rises/article_3fdd72f2-233a-5e12-8a2a-c69e23ef5b3c.html"">monitor train speeds</a> to ensure they don't exceed preset limits.</p> \n<h3>4) Derailments are most often caused by track problems</h3> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""3692892"" alt=""train accidents by casue"" src=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3692892/train-accident-causes.0.jpg""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">(Javier Zarracina/Vox)</p> \n<p>Derailments can sometimes be caused by operator error or equipment malfunction — but more often, they're due to track problems. As <a href=""https://books.google.com/books?id=5mKefpEufkgC&amp;q=derail#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true"">Bibel notes in his book</a>, ""Broken, settled, spread, shifted, or overturned rails account for about 50% of the equipment related derailments.""</p> \n<p>We still don't know the cause of the Philadelphia derailment, but it's worth noting here that some of the decline in overall train derailments has been driven by huge investments freight companies have made into maintaining their tracks. As the <a href=""http://www.omaha.com/money/even-as-derailments-decline-pressure-on-the-rail-industry-rises/article_3fdd72f2-233a-5e12-8a2a-c69e23ef5b3c.html"">Omaha World-Herald noted last year</a>, the freight company BNSF spent $5 billion on it in 2014.</p> \n<p>The same can't be said for Amtrak. The system has been <a href=""http://www.nationaljournal.com/magazine/amtrak-acela-high-speed-trains-20150417"">underfunded for years</a>, and <a href=""http://articles.philly.com/2014-09-13/business/53855370_1_northeast-corridor-amtrak-president-joseph-boardman-money-losing-long-distance-routes"">federal legislation requires it</a> to use the revenue it generates in the busy Northeast Corridor (where <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/7/7/5876065/map-these-three-cities-account-for-half-of-amtrak-ridership"">most of its riders are</a>) to subsidize operations on the rest of its network, which lose money.</p> \n<p>This has led to <a href=""http://www.nec-commission.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/NEC-Five-Year-Capital-Needs-Assessment-FY15-19.pdf"">deteriorating track conditions</a> in the Northeast (Amtrak trains ride on tracks owned by freight companies elsewhere), even as passenger numbers steadily climb. It's impossible to say for sure, but this may have played a role in Tuesday's derailment.</p>",Business & Finance
"Facebook Instant Articles, explained",http://www.vox.com/2015/5/13/8600753/facebook-instant-articles-explained,Facebook says its new program will allow news articles to load faster. But critics see a threat to the future of journalism.,"<p>Facebook has a problem, or thinks it does: reading news stories from Facebook's mobile app doesn't work very well. The company says the average news article takes eight seconds to launch — time in which a bored mobile user might give up and open another application altogether.</p> \n<p>Facebook wants to change that. So today the company <a href=""http://media.fb.com/2015/05/12/instantarticles/"">announced a new partnership</a> with some of the nation's most prestigious publications, including the New York Times, National Geographic, and the Atlantic, where Facebook will actively host entire articles on behalf of news organizations.</p> \n<p>Facebook's hope is that this will drastically improve article loading times, particularly on mobile devices. The company is also offering ways for publishers to improve the display of images and video.</p> \n<p>But even as major news organizations participate in the partnership, journalists are worried that the deal will give Facebook too much power over the news business. Fusion's Felix Salmon, for example, <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://fusion.net/story/108799/how-facebook-could-kill-the-news-brand/"">wrote in March</a> that if news organizations signed up with Facebook, they risked ""losing most of the things which make [a] news brand memorable and unique.""</p> \n<h3>How will Facebook's deal with publishers affect ordinary users?</h3> \n<p><span>The main thing users will notice — if they notice anything at all — is that articles from certain media organizations start loading more quickly than they did before.</span></p> \n<p>In the past, when a Facebook user on a smartphone clicked on a link to a news story, it would open a separate browser window and begin downloading an entire webpage. In the new model, publishers upload copies of their articles to Facebook so they can be hosted on Facebook's servers. This allows Facebook to optimize how the articles are delivered to Facebook.</p> \n<p>Facebook hasn't provided a lot of details on the technology behind the product, but what looks to be happening is Facebook is pre-loading the article's content so that it's already on the device when a user clicks a link. Right now, Instant Articles are only available for iOS, but an Android version is expected soon.</p> \n<p>The resulting speed increase is dramatic:</p> \n<p> </p> \n<blockquote lang=""en"" class=""twitter-tweet""> \n<p dir=""ltr"" lang=""en"">Compare and contrast: Facebook instant articles vs Twitter link <a href=""http://t.co/IlNCg68fYw"">pic.twitter.com/IlNCg68fYw</a></p> \n— Matt Roper (@mattjroper) <a href=""https://twitter.com/mattjroper/status/598489543478751232"">May 13, 2015</a>\n</blockquote> \n<p> </p> \n<p> \n<script charset=""utf-8"" src=""//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js""></script> \n</p> \n<p>But aside from this speed increase, users probably won't notice much difference. Facebook is touting several other features, such as the ability to zoom in on images and autoplay videos, but it's not clear how often publishers will take advantage of these features.</p> \n<h3>Why are publishers doing this?</h3> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""3693936"" alt=""94123774.0.jpg"" src=""https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3693936/94123774.0.jpg""></p> \n<p> </p> \n<p class=""caption"">(Mario Tama/Getty Images)</p> \n<p> </p> \n<p>Publishers have grown dependent on traffic from Facebook, and Facebook has a lot of discretion to decide which content is featured in its users' news feed. This fact gives Facebook a lot of leverage. Some publishers fear that if they don't participate, Facebook will point its firehose of traffic in the direction of more pliant competitors.</p> \n<p>At the same time, the program offers some benefits for publishers as well. Faster loading times are good for publishers as much as they are for Facebook. And joining Instant Articles gives publishers access to Facebook's powerful advertising program. Facebook knows a lot about its users, and this data allows them to target ads at users who are most likely to be interested in them. That's good for advertisers, who are able to get a bigger impact from fewer ads.</p> \n<p>Facebook-hosted articles can have Facebook-hosted ads next to them, and Facebook will give publishers <a href=""http://blogs.wsj.com/cmo/2015/05/13/what-ads-will-look-like-in-facebooks-instant-articles/"">70 percent</a> of the revenue generated with these Facebook ads. If Facebook's ad platform is good enough, publishers may find that 70 percent of the money from a Facebook ad is worth more than 100 percent of an ad they sell themselves.</p> \n<p>Facebook made a few other concessions to coax publishers to get on board. First, publishers retain the right to place their own ads next to the content, and according to reports, they'll keep 100 percent of the revenues from these ads — at least for now. Facebook will also <a href=""http://recode.net/2015/05/12/facebook-starts-publishing-the-new-york-times-buzzfeed-and-more-with-its-instant-articles-program/"">allow</a> publishers to independently measure traffic to Instant Articles using third-party tools such as Google Analytics and Omniture.</p> \n<p>Finally, publishers retain substantial control over the branding of Instant Articles. A New York Times article will have a prominent New York Times logo at the top, making clear to readers that they're reading a Times story, not a generic Facebook news story.</p> \n<h3>Why do critics say this is a threat to journalism?</h3> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""3693946"" alt=""16942766725_b6bf706e99_k.0.jpg"" src=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3693946/16942766725_b6bf706e99_k.0.jpg""></p> \n<p> </p> \n<p class=""caption"">Facebook Chief Product Officer Chris Cox.

Here's how Felix Salmon <a href=""http://fusion.net/story/108799/how-facebook-could-kill-the-news-brand/"">put it</a> in March:</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>It’s about losing control over exactly how your content is presented and delivered — about losing most of the things which make your news brand memorable and unique. At some point, it’s easy to foresee a world where talented individuals, rather than brands, make a good living by producing the kind of news content which ""works really well"" on Facebook. If Facebook becomes the new YouTube in that respect, and if Facebook continues to grow as a trusted news source in its own right, then the result could be an existential crisis for news organizations with old-fashioned things like editors and fact-checkers and clear ethical guidelines.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Skeptics believe that news organizations need the kind of control they get from running their own website. In their view, running their own websites fosters a stronger bond between readers and publishers and gives publishers more opportunity to innovate.</p> \n<p>They also worry that the relatively favorable terms of Facebook's current deal with publishers won't last. They worry that Facebook could start taking a greater cut of ad revenue, limit news organizations' control over how their content is presented, and limit their access to data about their users' online activities.</p> \n<p>As David Carr <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/27/business/media/facebook-offers-life-raft-but-publishers-are-wary.html"" target=""_blank"">put it</a> last year: ""Many publishers are worried that what has been a listening tour could become a telling tour, in which Facebook dictates terms because it drives so much traffic.""</p> \n<p>Worst of all, they worry that Facebook will use the leverage provided by its huge audience to coerce the rest of the news industry into joining Facebook's platform. Now that nine prestigious publishers have agreed to join the platform, Facebook could direct more traffic to them and less traffic to the rest of the news industry. That would create tremendous pressure on those other publishers to join up.</p> \n<h3>Are the critics right?</h3> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""3693956"" alt=""2396559684_e397ec217f_o.0.jpg"" src=""https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3693956/2396559684_e397ec217f_o.0.jpg""></p> \n<p> </p> \n<p class=""caption"">Users come to Facebook for this kind of thing more than for news. (<a href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/40765798@N00/2396559684/in/photolist-4DLZGy-58mDJ4-p4XkoP-d1LmMo-4G7Uyi-mLdPH-Q7q8a-4DGHti-342deq-4SohMv-7wNjQX-8m9fEt-73gFj6-c4ug8f-x5JKJ-4B8Hev-fxgGtD-ao1kY1-2BTKYu-DrNxJ-d32zC7-daV9CK-6MenJG-GddEf-dusSyo-FXjgo-7med2o-dYc45D-dxBaXG-pEnLtp-GSRWE-4kb4zG-2cy4dp-6qoSTC-cwUuT3-6dBBfS-ofian-jrRLY-3sTpR1-22suSL-drQCTb-9EyTUv-3st7ah-8xz7qh-p8aSC6-6iqWfn-4TtS6x-pTnyXj-4Uk61t-4wttVC"" target=""_blank"">sabianmaggy</a>)</p> \n<p> </p> \n<p>It's too early to say, but I'm skeptical.</p> \n<p>If you're worried about Facebook having too much power over the news business, then your beef is with user behavior in general, not Instant Articles in particular. The reason Facebook generates so much traffic for news organizations is because users spend a huge amount of time on the site.</p> \n<p>And reading news is a small fraction of people's Facebook time. People mostly use Facebook to look at pictures of their grandchildren, share photos of their friends' weddings, and swap gossip about life in their hometowns. Facebook would continue to be a very popular website even if it had zero news content.</p> \n<p>So it's not obvious how much publisher participation in Instant Articles increases Facebook's power. Facebook had a lot of power over the news industry last week, and it would have continued having that power even if no publishers had signed up for Facebook-hosted news.</p> \n<p>And crucially, these content deals are non-exclusive. Facebook users on iPhones will see a special, Facebook-optimized version of New York Times articles. For everyone else, the Times website will work exactly the same way it did before. And that's unlikely to change, because while Facebook generates a lot of traffic, most of the news industry's traffic still comes from elsewhere on the web.</p> \n<p>This means that news organizations retain a fair amount of leverage. If Facebook tried to drastically alter the terms of the deal, the news organizations can quit the program and take their content with them. They'd face some costs for this — slower load times and the loss of access to Facebook's lucrative ad platform — but that's just another way of saying they'd be back where they were before they signed up for the program.</p> \n<h3>What does Instant Articles say about the evolution of the web?</h3> \n<p>The web is maturing. The early days of any new communications media tends to be a free-for-all, with a lot of small publishers or broadcasters experimenting with the new technologies and building up modest audiences.</p> \n<p>But then there's usually a period of consolidation, when a few channels gain a disproportionate share of the traffic. In the 20th century, the television business became dominated by ABC, CBS, and NBC. Most cities became dominated by one or two newspapers. A few magazines like Time and Newsweek dominated the weekly news business.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""right""><span>These new platforms still give users a lot more control than the old ones</span></q></p> \n<p>Something similar seems to be happening on the web. Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube are emerging as the ABC, CBS, and NBC of the 21st century — sites that attract vastly more traffic than most others.</p> \n<p>But the web has two big things going for it. First, these new platforms still give users a lot more control than the old ones did. In 1970, everyone had to choose from the same 3 TV shows. Today, Facebook does a pretty good job of letting you pick what content you're interested in, and Twitter gives power users even more control over the content they choose.</p> \n<p>Second, while a few sites are a lot more popular than the rest, there are still a lot of options out there. You can find news using Reddit or Digg or Pinterest or dozens of other sites. And while Facebook has a huge head start, barriers to entry are still pretty low. If Facebook stops serving its users well, someone else might take its place.</p>",Business & Finance
5 overhyped media trends that turned out to just be a big recession,http://www.vox.com/2015/5/20/8630193/recession-trends,"From carless millennials to college grads pouring coffee, there's no new normal.","<p>Conventional wisdom in the United States is and has long been that the Great Recession at the close of the previous decade marked a structural break in important social and economic trends. Proponents of this view often like to portray themselves as a minority of embattled truth-tellers, but <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/17/upshot/dont-be-so-sure-the-economy-will-return-to-normal.html?rref=upshot"">from New York Times columns</a> to Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner dismissing stimulative policies as a <a href=""https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=geithner%20sugar%20high"">""sugar high,""</a> the structural view has dominated both the media and the practical policy debate.</p> \n<p>But a closer look at the trend data shows this is much less true than people thought. The real story of the past seven years is that the Great Recession was just really, really big. As the recovery continues, the shifts are melting away and revealing something far more boring: that things are going right back to normal.</p> \n<h3>1) College graduates are getting white-collar jobs</h3> \n<p>This is a big one. As the recession made jobs scarce, many college graduates found themselves working the kind of low-paid retail jobs they had gone to school specifically in order to avoid. Trend pieces about newly minted bachelor's degree-holders plying their trades at coffee shops and clothing stores spread across the land. As far back as 2011, Kevin Carey pointed out that these anecdotes <a href=""http://www.newrepublic.com/article/economy/89675/bad-job-market-media-wrong-college-degree"">pop up during every recession</a>, but the Great Recession lasted so long that the New York Federal Reserve even started releasing a formal index of the phenomenon.</p> \n<p>And it was real enough — until the latest update, released this week, <a href=""http://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2015/05/the-class-of-2015-might-have-a-little-better-luck-finding-a-good-job.html"">which showed that the trend is abating</a>. This is still far from the best of times for new college grads (or anyone else), but things are clearly heading back to normal.</p> \n<h3>2) People are moving out of their parents' basements</h3> \n<p>The bad years generated dozens of trend pieces about young people living at home with their parents, often metaphorically described as living in the basement. Data available in <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/1/5/7485757/living-with-parents"">January suggested that this trend was reversing</a>, and <a href=""http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-04-28/millennials-are-moving-out-of-basements-and-into-apartments"">late-April census data confirms it</a> — new households are being formed at the fastest pace since 2005, and demand for rental housing is surging.</p> \n<h3>3) Millennials are buying cars</h3> \n<p>Another recession-era trend staple was the observation that millennials weren't buying and driving cars at the same rate as earlier generations. While <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/04/22/why-arent-younger-americans-driving-anymore/"">sharp observers like Brad Plumer</a> thought this might have something to do with the weak labor market, overeager urbanists and trend-hungry journalists often spun it as a deep shift in American values. But guess what? <a href=""http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/04/millennials-not-so-cheap-after-all/391026/"">Generation Y now owns more cars than Generation X</a>, as an improving economy is giving more people the financial means to buy automobiles, a technology that remains both useful and expensive, just as it's been for the past seven or eight decades.</p> \n<h3>4) Retailers are raising wages</h3> \n<p>During the recovery years, employment growth has been stronger in traditionally low-paying, low-status service sector jobs than in middle-wage occupations like manufacturing. This reflects a long-term trend that's been taking place for decades, but mixed with very weak wages during the peak unemployment years led to a surge of worries about a <a href=""https://hbr.org/2014/08/employers-arent-just-whining-the-skills-gap-is-real"">""skills gap""</a> or <a href=""http://go.redirectingat.com/?id=66960X1516588&amp;site=Vox.com&amp;xs=1&amp;isjs=1&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.economist.com%2Fnews%2Fleaders%2F21599762-prepare-robot-invasion-it-will-change-way-people-think-about-technology-rise&amp;xguid=4f0aff1f57ca1ea87c9995965214ae31&amp;xuuid=75f08bb18c80856e8feb3daf82ca7fc4&amp;xsessid=e04c02009c313aff9b9cd897275999d1&amp;xcreo=0&amp;xed=0&amp;sref=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.vox.com%2F2015%2F2%2F26%2F8107517%2Fwalmart-tj-maxx-raises&amp;pref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F&amp;xtz=240"">robots</a> fundamentally altering the economy.</p> \n<p>Yet recent months have seen stories about big wage hikes at <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/2/26/8107517/walmart-tj-maxx-raises"">T.J.

The American population continues to move on net <a href=""http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/think-millennials-prefer-the-city-think-again/"">away from central cities and toward the suburbs</a>. Part of the story is that most people — <a href=""http://www.wsj.com/articles/millennials-prefer-single-family-homes-in-the-suburbs-1421896797"">including most young people</a> — say they prefer suburban living. And even the minority who <i>do</i> like living in central cities are faced with the problem that <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/The-Rent-Too-Damn-High-ebook/dp/B0078XGJXO"">NIMBY barriers to building new houses</a> in thriving cities like New York and San Francisco make it difficult for them to gain net population.</p> \n<h3>Of course, there are still a lot of problems</h3> \n<p>To say the recession is a passing phenomenon that the country is recovering from is sometimes taken as a full-pollyanna sign or a denial of one's right to complain about broad social problems in the United States. Do not make this mistake! Think back to 2007, before the recession started. America had a lot of problems back then, ranging from high child poverty to mass incarceration to a shockingly inefficient health-care system.</p> \n<p>Just because things are heading ""back to normal"" doesn't mean you need to stop complaining about longstanding problems. But pretty much everything that made 2011 seem significantly different from 2007 now looks to be a consequence of the ups and downs of the business cycle.</p>",Business & Finance
LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman on the biggest lie employers tell employees,http://www.vox.com/2015/5/22/8639717/reid-hoffman-the-alliance,And vice versa.,"<p>In his new book <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/The-Alliance-Managing-Talent-Networked/dp/1625275773""><em>The Alliance</em></a><em>, </em>Reid Hoffman argues that the relationship between employers and employees is built on ""a dishonest conversation.""</p> \n<p>Hoffman would know. As co-founder and executive chairman of LinkedIn, he sits atop the largest, most data-rich hiring platform the world has ever seen. As a venture capitalist who made early investments in everything from Facebook to Airbnb, he's helped some of the era's most successful companies grow.</p> \n<p>And now he wants both workers and employers to begin having honest conversations with one another — conversations that admit employment isn't for life, that loyalty only lasts so long as it coincides with self-interest, and that the relationship doesn't have to end when the worker leaves.</p> \n<h3>1) The biggest lie that employers tell employees</h3> \n<p>""The biggest lie is that the employment relationship is like family,"" Hoffman says.</p> \n<p>He goes on to describe two versions of the lie. ""One is where the employer is actually deluding themselves."" Employers may want to believe their workplace really is like a family, and, in that moment, they may convince themselves it actually is like a family.</p> \n<aside><q>""You don't fire your kid because of bad grades""</q></aside> \n<p>The other version of the lie comes because the employer wants the employee to believe it. ""They really want the employee to be loyal to the company,"" Hoffman continues. ""That's when it gets deceptive.""</p> \n<p>But the employer-employee relationship isn't like a family. ""You don't fire your kid because of bad grades,"" Hoffman says.</p> \n<h3>2) The biggest lie employees tell employers</h3> \n<p>But it's not just employers who lie. Prospective employees do, too.</p> \n<p>""They know that employers want loyalty,"" Hoffman says. ""They know they want to hear, 'Oh, I plan on working here for the rest of my career.' But most employees recognize that career progression probably requires eventually moving to another company. But that never comes up.""</p> \n<p>This is core to Hoffman's idea that both employers and employees should look at a particular job less as a lifetime contract and more as a ""tour of duty"" — a limited-time engagement meant to achieve specific ends on both sides. But until employers stop pretending employees are family and employees stop pretending their aim is a job they'll never leave, neither side can have that conversation.</p> \n<h3>3) The most unusual question LinkedIn asks prospective hires</h3> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""3717682""><img src=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3717682/109008985.jpg""></div> \n<p>LinkedIn is an organization dedicated to helping other companies hire talent. It has access to more hiring data than arguably any other corporation on earth. So I asked Hoffman: how do they hire? What do they ask that most companies don't?</p> \n<p>""All of our managers and recruiters ask about how working here will be transformational to your career,"" Hoffman says. ""For example, our SVP of engineering, Kevin Scott, will ask, 'What's the next job that you would like to have post-LinkedIn?' That's not because we don't want our stars to stay at LinkedIn for a long time. It's because we're so committed to the idea that we're going to be transformative in the prospective employee's career. So we need to know, what's the next job after this? What do you want it to be?""</p> \n<p>But don't job candidates find that weird?</p> \n<p>""No,"" Hoffman says. ""It's framed as, 'We're planning on having a huge impact in your career if you're working here.' And they find that liberating. It brings some honesty to what is otherwise kind of a collective self-deception dance. And it also means that when they leave, we still care about them.""</p> \n<p>""I was at an Airbnb board meeting and I ran into two former LinkedIn employees who walked up to me and said, 'Hey, how's it going? I'm working here now. I'd love to tell you about some of the stuff that I'm learning.' They know the way that we operate, is not, 'Oh, you've left LinkedIn, so you're no longer part of our tribe.' We continue to be allies. We can continue to try to help each other. That lets them come up and start telling me things about things could be really helpful to LinkedIn.""</p> \n<div class=""chorus-snippet m-newsletter-signup""> \n<h3>Want more Vox in your inbox?

And I've never felt very good about it. Don't job interviews bias you toward gregariousness? Is there any real reason to believe shy employees perform worse than extroverted ones?</p> \n<aside><q>""If you told me, 'Pick one — you could either get references or an interview,' I would pick references every day of the week""</q></aside> \n<p>""I think you can learn some useful things from an interview,"" Hoffman says. ""You just have to be clear about what it is you're actually trying to learn. I think you can learn about chemistry and fit. I think you can learn about a person's immediate response to a challenge. But if you told me, 'Pick one — you could either get references or an interview,' I would pick references every day of the week.</p> \n<p>""I advise all the companies that I affiliate with to take reference checking very seriously. References actually tell you how people work, what their work ethic is. That is a critical piece of data that cannot be put aside or done casually. Frequently employers are so casual about references they either a) don't check them, or b) only check the ones the prospective candidate gives them. In fact, you want both those references and others.""</p> \n<h3>5) The case for hiring your friends</h3> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""3717688"">\n<img src=""https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3717688/129678204.jpg""> \n<div class=""caption""> \n<p>Remember Web 2.0?</p> \n</div> \n</div> \n<p>Hoffman's former chief of staff, Ben Casnocha, wrote <a href=""http://casnocha.com/reid-hoffman-lessons"">an interesting piece</a> on leadership lessons he's learned from Hoffman. This one in particular surprised me: ""If you’re choosing between working with someone who’s a trusted friend and a 7 out of 10 on competence, versus a stranger who’s a 9 out of 10 on competence, who should you pick? Answer: if the trusted friend is a fast learner, pick the trusted friend.""</p> \n<p>The normal management guidance is don't hire your friends. According to Nick Bilton's <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.amazon.com/Hatching-Twitter-Story-Friendship-Betrayal/dp/1591847087"">history of Twitter</a>, when Evan Williams asked legendary CEO coach Bill Campbell what the worst mistake he could make is, Campbell replied: ""Hire your fucking friends!"" So I asked Hoffman why he believes in hiring friends.</p> \n<p>""You need to handle it well,"" Hoffman replied. ""If I get to the point where I'm hiring a friend, I say, 'Look. Here's how we keep the friendship and the work stuff different. Here's how I'm going to treat you a little differently as a friend. Here's how you're going to act a little differently as a friend.' I'm going to be clear about the fact that I'm not going to privilege them at all in the continuum to the job and promotions and bonuses. All of that will be done in a very fair way.</p> \n<p>""On the other hand, I will actually, as a friend, go out of my way to invest even more energy than I normally do to make this work. I'm committing to put in a little bit more energy. In return, one thing is I want you, as a friend, to do the same. The benefit you get from this is both a) a higher level of trust, and b) you get to work with people that you actually really like to spend time with. Which usually facilitates a generally positive working relationship anyway.""</p> \n<h3>6) How philosophy training makes you a better investor</h3> \n<p>Hoffman's background isn't typical. He didn't study computer science or get an MBA. He studied philosophy. And he thinks he's better off for it.</p> \n<p>""One of the things that philosophy is very helpful on is how to think pretty precisely about arguments, and an investment thesis is fundamentally an argument. Part of philosophical training is making you really understand how good an argument is and how to think through the alternatives. Philosophy is really good at posing the question, 'If the universe were such that this data would be different or the universe was such that this framework would be wrong, what happens to the argument then?' Questioning those premises really helps you figure out why someone smart might actually hold a different point of view.</p> \n<p>""We live in a probabilistic universe, and we tend to think in determinist ways. If A is data-driven and I think I have that data, how certain am I that I have that data? What could I discover that might actually tell me that that data is formulated wrongly? When you dig into it, most of your arguments are actually probabilistic. They're not certain, even when you have data. You're really trying to get a sense of whether you have a reasonable bet on the probability.""</p> \n<hr> \n<p><strong>Correction: </strong>Ben Casnocha is Hoffman's former chief of staff, not his current one.

Jim Bankoff, the CEO of Vox Media, sent a companywide note laying out the deal — how it will work, why it's happening, and what it means for both sides. His note was helpfully formatted as a Vox explainer, and with his permission, it appears, with light edits for clarity, here. </i></p> \n<p><i></i><i>(For more on the Re/code deal, read </i><a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.theverge.com/2015/5/26/8662905/the-verge-and-recode-are-joining-forces"">this piece</a><i> by Nilay Patel, editor of Vox's sister site The Verge, and marvel at his exceptionally tight GIF game; or watch Mossberg, Swisher and Bankoff announce the acquisition at the </i><a target=""_blank"" href=""http://recode.net/2015/05/26/a-note-to-our-readers/"">Code Conference</a><i> in California.)</i></p> \n<h3>What is Re/code?</h3> \n<p>Re/code is probably the most respected and influential tech news media brand among business and C-suite audiences. It launched about 16 months ago and has grown steadily. Unlike <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.theverge.com/"">The Verge</a>, which is going after a broad and large consumer audience by being the most widely respected technology lifestyle media brand, Re/code's strength is with technology and business elites and leaders.</p> \n<p>In addition to its digital presence, Re/code also runs the most successful and prestigious conference business in tech, featuring its flagship Code Conference, which began tonight. Re/code is led by Kara Swisher and Walt Mossberg, who started the successful AllThingsD business and have had long and impressive careers as journalists. They have a team of about 45 people who will shortly be Vox Media employees.</p> \n<h3>Why are we doing this?</h3> \n<p>1) Vox Media is built around empowering the most talented digital voices — from our beginnings as a network of sports bloggers in SB Nation through our launch of The Verge and Polygon, acquisition of Curbed LLC, and launch of Vox.com, we've been all about building media brands through the combination of media hackers, platform and culture. The addition of Kara, Walt, and the rest of the Re/code team is a natural progression of our focus.</p> \n<p>2) We are strengthening our leadership in tech coverage with the addition of Re/code. The Verge is already the preeminent digital tech/lifestyle media brand, with tremendous growth under Nilay's leadership, reaching a consumer audience of over 24.5 million unique visitors in April and generating 40 million video views each month. With the addition of Re/code, we will extend our leadership of comprehensive tech coverage online, with Re/code's unparalleled expertise in tech business news, to complement the broad consumer appeal of The Verge.</p> \n<p>3) Conferences: Re/code is the undisputed leader in tech business conferences across substance, access, and quality. Vox Media will leverage Re/code's leadership in this space and explore ways to apply it to our other media brands.</p> \n<p>4) Re/code will benefit from joining Vox Media, integrating Vox Media's various capabilities including marketing, communications, audience development, sales, and production. Their clients will become ours and will benefit from Vox Creative's solutions. Re/code will eventually migrate to Chorus and will be another shining example of the power of our platform.</p> \n<h3>Wait — we already have one of the biggest tech sites. Why do we need another?</h3> \n<p>If you've read this far, you've gathered that The Verge and Re/code have a very different focus. In fact, per Comscore, there is only a 4 percent audience overlap between the two properties.  The Verge is a big, consumer-focused media brand covering all aspects of tech culture, from science to entertainment to transportation and more.</p> \n<p>Re/code's focus is on the business of tech from M&amp;A to enterprise, executive movement and corporate strategy. The tech category is big and valuable, with some strong competition. Between The Verge and Re/code we are undisputed leaders, with the momentum to go much further together.</p> \n<h3>What about reviews? Re/code does product reviews, doesn't it?</h3> \n<p>We are going to move the amazing review team on Re/code and have them join The Verge. Walt Mossberg, the most feared, followed, and admired product reviewer of the past few decades, will also contribute to The Verge review program. The program will report up through Dieter and Nilay and put The Verge far ahead of all other product review programs.</p> \n<h3>What's the reporting structure?</h3> \n<p>Walt and Kara both report to Lock and will be in charge of editorial for Re/code. Lia Kennett, Re/code's current COO, will report to Marty and run the conference business. The review program reports to Dieter and Nilay as exciting additions to The Verge team.</p> \n<h3>What does this mean for our Vox Media events team?</h3> \n<p>Not much day to day. We have a great events team led by Jen Leibow. Her group will continue to do what it does, organizing successful events for Vox Media and our advertisers. This is very different work than running the Re/code conference business which is what Lia will do. Over time, as often happens across many groups at Vox Media, we would not be surprised to see some radical collaboration, sharing of learnings from each other, or at the very least clinking glasses with new colleagues who share a deep appreciation for how much work goes into making an ""in real life"" production look effortless.</p> \n<h3>What about cultural fit?</h3> \n<p>I've known Walt and Kara for the better part of two decades now. Their values as humans and professionals align with ours, but we'll all have to make an effort to welcome the Re/code team, make them feel at home, and also learn from them.</p> \n<h3>Won't this distract our focus?</h3> \n<p>Well, if you are reading this, you are already distracted, but I believe if we are committed, we can keep it to a minimum. I am asking Marty Moe to help me coordinate the integration process, working with People, Culture, Revenue, Finance, and any other relevant teams. Part of Marty's role is to make sure we don't create distractions.  Our big initiatives, like video growth, audience development/data/growth, Unison, Anthem, etc., and our four priorities that we established at the beginning of the year don't change. There will be no changes to our product roadmap or our strategic initiatives.</p> \n<h3>When is Re/Code moving to Chorus?</h3> \n<p>Not for a while. No date set and no expectations. Unison, Anthem and other product work remain the priorities for the team. We also recognize that Curbed is first in line!</p> \n<h3>How much did this deal cost Vox Media?</h3> \n<p>Not saying, but have faith that we take the company's financial resources seriously and that this is an agreement that works well for both Vox Media and Re/code.</p> \n<h3>Whom would I like to thank?</h3> \n<p>I'm glad I asked. A lot of people had to work long hours, especially over the holiday weekend to get this done. Lauren Fisher, Brian Leung, Alexis Juneja, Steve Swad, Marty Moe, Trei Brundrett, Josh Albertson, Mike Burke, Fay Sliger, and Kevin Powers were all part of the core Vox Media team that helped to get this done. Of course, Kara, Walt, Lia, and others on the Re/code team have been great partners in the process. You learn a lot about people through a process like this, and we all got along tremendously well. Now several others will get involved to ensure a smooth transition.</p> \n<h3>What now?</h3> \n<p>Tweet it, high-five about it, ask me questions about it ... but then get back to whatever you were doing.</p>",Business & Finance
People worrying about a technology bubble keep making this mistake,http://www.vox.com/2015/5/28/8679725/bubbles-interest-rates,"Low interest rates do drive up valuations, but that's not a bubble â€” that's part of the fundamentals.","<p>Snapchat CEO <a href=""https://recode.net/2015/05/26/snapchat-ceo-the-tech-bubble-is-real-and-yes-it-will-burst/"">Evan Spiegel warned of a tech valuation bubble</a> (or maybe a general stock market bubble) at a Re/code conference earlier this week and got his remarks picked up at <a href=""http://www.cnbc.com/id/102708559"">CNBC</a>, the <a href=""http://www.latimes.com/business/technology/la-fi-tn-snapchat-ipo-20150527-story.html"">LA Times</a>, and all over the business press.</p> \n<p>It's extremely possible that valuations will go down in the future, but if you specifically look at what he said, you can see that we're actually in something like a bubble of bubble calls. <a href=""https://recode.net/2015/05/26/snapchat-ceo-the-tech-bubble-is-real-and-yes-it-will-burst/"">Check out Jason Del Rey's writeup</a>:</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>Spiegel said the investment bubble is being fueled by an ""easy money policy"" and low interest rates, which <a href=""https://recode.net/2015/05/19/the-economy-looks-like-its-picking-up-which-could-mean-a-slowdown-in-tech-investing/"">may not last a whole lot longer</a> according to recent economic indicators. Those low interest rates are funneling investments toward stock markets, hedge funds and, yes, startups.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Lots of Silicon Valley types and venture capitalists have this <a href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/silicon-valley-low-interest-rates-tech-bubble-2014-3"">concern about interest rates</a>, and it makes some sense. But here's a crucial point: <em>this isn't what a bubble is</em>.</p> \n<p>Low interest rates are not irrational exuberance. They're not mass hysteria. They're not hype. They're not a search for a greater fool. They're not overconfidence. They are very real. You can <a href=""http://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/interest-rates/Pages/TextView.aspx?data=yield"">look them up on the internet</a>. It is a genuine fact about the world that if you want a safe financial asset these days, you need to accept a very low nominal rate of return. That genuinely makes other asset classes — everything from houses to ordinary stock shares to zany digital media startups — look more appealing than they would be in a world of higher interest rates.</p> \n<p>And that makes it eminently reasonable for the price of riskier asset classes to be higher than they would be in a world of higher interest rates.</p> \n<p>To the extent that low interest rates push up the value of VC-backed technology startups, in other words, that's an example of asset prices being driven by the fundamentals. It's the opposite of a bubble.</p> \n<p>Now, what I think Spiegel means is that these conditions won't last forever. Which is true. Financial conditions never stay the same forever. But ""future valuations will change in response to changing objective conditions"" is a totally different claim from ""today's irrational mania will evaporate and prove to have been a mirage.""</p>",Business & Finance

Iceland put bankers in jail rather than bailing them out â€” and it worked,http://www.vox.com/2015/6/9/8751267/iceland-capital-controls,"Lower unemployment than the USA, and much lower than the Very Serious People's star pupil, Ireland.","<p>Yesterday, Iceland's prime minister, Sigmundur Gunnlaugsson, <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/08/iceland-to-lift-capital-controls-to-help-boost-economy"">announced a plan</a> that will essentially close the books on his country's approach to handling the financial crisis — an approach that deviated greatly from the preferences of global financial elites and succeeded quite well. Instead of embracing the orthodoxy of bank bailouts, austerity, and low inflation, Iceland did just the opposite. And even though its economy was hammered by the banking crisis perhaps harder than any other in the world, its labor didn't deteriorate all that much, and it had a great recovery.</p> \n<p>How great? Well, compare the evolution of Iceland's unemployment rate with what happened in Ireland, the star pupil of the Very Serious People:</p> \n<p><iframe src=""https://www.google.com/publicdata/embed?ds=z8o7pt6rd5uqa6_&amp;ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=unemployment_rate&amp;fdim_y=seasonality:sa&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=country_group&amp;idim=country:is:ie&amp;ifdim=country_group&amp;tstart=1041829200000&amp;tend=1425618000000&amp;hl=en_US&amp;dl=en&amp;ind=false"" marginheight=""0"" marginwidth=""0"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""0"" height=""500"" width=""750""></iframe></p> \n<p>Or compare it with the United States:</p> \n<p><iframe src=""https://www.google.com/publicdata/embed?ds=k3s92bru78li6_&amp;ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=lur&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=world&amp;idim=world:Earth&amp;idim=country:IS:US&amp;ifdim=world&amp;tstart=1023422400000&amp;tend=1370577600000&amp;hl=en_US&amp;dl=en&amp;ind=false"" marginheight=""0"" marginwidth=""0"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""0"" height=""500"" width=""750""></iframe></p> \n<p>How did Iceland pull it off?</p> \n<h3>Let the banks go bust</h3> \n<p>For starters, rather than scrambling to mobilize public resources to make sure banks didn't default on their various obligations, Iceland let the banks go bust. Executives of the country's most important bank <a href=""http://www.cnbc.com/id/102422785"">were prosecuted as criminals</a>.</p> \n<h3>Reject austerity</h3> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""3766806""><img src=""https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3766806/iceland-government-debt-to-gdp.png""></div> \n<p>Iceland was nonetheless hit by a very serious recession that caused its debt-to-GDP ratio to soar. But even after several years of steady increases, the government didn't panic. It prioritized recovery. And when recovery was underway and the ratio began to fall, the government let it fall gently.</p> \n<h3>Devalue and accept inflation</h3> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""3766812""><img src=""https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3766812/iceland-inflation-cpi.png""></div> \n<p>There's no free lunch in life, and no country recovers from a severe recession without some bad things happening. But while most developed countries have gone through years of grindingly high unemployment paired with super-low inflation, Iceland did the reverse. It let the value of its currency tumble, which naturally brought about higher prices.</p> \n<p>But as a result, the country's export industries rapidly gained ground in international markets. Unemployment rose, but maxed out at a modest 7.6 percent before falling steadily to a very low level. In the US and Europe, the priority has been on low inflation to protect the asset values of the wealthy. Iceland prioritized jobs, and it worked.</p> \n<h3>Impose temporary capital controls</h3> \n<p>In the context of bank defaults and a plunging currency, the government felt it was necessary to impose an additional measure — <em>capital controls</em>, regulations restricting Icelandic citizens' ability to take their money out of the country. This is a serious violation of free market orthodoxy. More importantly, it can be a major hassle to ordinary people's lives and an impediment to starting new businesses. In some countries, like Argentina, capital controls become a breeding ground of corruption and mischief.</p> \n<p>That leads some to believe that no matter how well heterodox policies work <em>economically,</em> they're ultimately doomed to political failure.</p> \n<p>Iceland shows that's not the case. Getting policy right is difficult, but it can be done. And the upside to doing the right thing — devaluing the currency massively, then imposing capital controls to contain the fallout, then ending the capital controls once the economy recovers — can be enormous. Iceland has had a rough time over the past seven or eight years, but so have a lot of other countries. Things are looking up there now because the country's leaders had the wisdom to reject elements of the self-satisfied conventional wisdom that have proven so harmful elsewhere.</p> \n<hr> \n<b>Vox Video: How the rich stole the recovery, in one chart</b> \n<!--  ########  BEGIN VOLUME VIDEO  ########  --> \n<div class=""volume-video"" id=""volume-placement-2137"" data-volume-placement=""article"" data-analytics-placement=""middle"" data-volume-id=""324"" data-volume-uuid=""002e9938e"" data-analytics-label=""Chart: How the rich stole the recovery | 324"" data-analytics-action=""volume:view:middle"" data-analytics-viewport=""video""></div> \n<!--  ########  END VOLUME VIDEO  ########  -->",Business & Finance
Why buying only the cable channels you watch probably wouldn't save you money,http://www.vox.com/2015/6/9/8753685/cable-bundling-netflix-good,"People think Netflix is unbundling cable channels, but in reality Netflix is a giant bundle of content.","<p>A <a href=""http://www.wsj.com/articles/why-does-the-cable-tv-bundle-exist-anyway-1433807825"">Monday article</a> in the Wall Street Journal argues that the internet is on the verge of killing cable companies' widely hated practice of bundling a lot of cable channels together into expensive packages:</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>Pushback is building that could finally break the bundle. Pay-TV subscriptions have peaked in the U.S., and viewers have alternatives through Internet services such as <a href=""http://quotes.wsj.com/NFLX"">Netflix</a>, Hulu, and YouTube. Distributors like Verizon’s FiOS are trying to find ways <a href=""http://www.wsj.com/articles/verizon-says-new-bundle-complies-with-espn-contract-1429629784"">to offer flexibility in pay-TV packages</a>, drawing a lawsuit from ESPN in the process. And networks including HBO and <a href=""http://quotes.wsj.com/CBS.A"">CBS</a> are now selling their content directly to consumers without requiring a subscription to a distributor’s big bundle.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>The article goes on to complain about how big media companies ""force"" cable companies — and through them, consumers — to pay for channels they don't want, artificially inflating the cost of cable service.</p> \n<p>The weird thing about this argument is that the company that has done the most to break the cable TV bundle — Netflix — is itself a giant bundle of content. Say you love <em>House of Cards</em> but aren't interested in the many other shows available through Netflix streaming. Netflix doesn't care. Either you subscribe to the whole Netflix bundle or you don't.</p> \n<p>It's true that you can buy individual <em>House of Cards</em> episodes from other companies like Amazon or Google — but only at a huge markup. Individual episodes cost $1.99. If you expect to watch more than four episodes a month, it makes more sense to get a $7.99 Netflix bundle, which lets you watch not only an unlimited number of <em>House of Cards</em> episodes but a ton of other content as well.</p> \n<p>This kind of bundling makes economic sense, because once a show has been created, the cost of distributing it to one additional person — what economists call marginal cost — is trivial. Removing channels from a bundle doesn't save content creators any money, so there's no reason to think it would save customers money either.</p> \n<p>The most popular cable channels, like ESPN and AMC, cost a lot because a lot of people want to watch them. The media companies that own them then throw in other, much less popular channels in hopes of making them more popular. But if media companies sold the popular channels by themselves, they'd do it at a price that was almost as high as they charge for the bundles. In an à-la-carte world, different customers would pay different amounts, but on average customers would pay about the same for a lot less content.</p> \n<p>It is true that the internet — and companies like Hulu, Netflix, and YouTube — is making the television market more competitive. But what's new about these services isn't that they do less bundling. Rather, it's that they're charging lower prices, and in the process resetting customers' expectations about how much television content should cost. But there's no reason to think this new competition will lead to a world where consumers no longer buy content in big bundles.</p>",Business & Finance
Twitter stock fell after weak third-quarter results. Here's why the company is struggling.,http://www.vox.com/2015/6/11/8761731/twitter-trouble-facebook-twtr,"Twitter gained just 4 million users in the third quarter, disappointing Wall Street analysts who want to see faster growth.","<p>Twitter stock plunged 11 percent in after-hours trading after the company released <a href=""http://recode.net/2015/10/27/twitter-expects-lower-sales-current-quarter-as-user-growth-stagnates/"" target=""_blank"">disappointing third-quarter results</a> on Tuesday. While Twitter met its revenue target for the quarter, user growth has slowed to a crawl, and the company revised its fourth-quarter financial results downward. The news comes a couple of weeks after CEO <span>Jack Dorsey</span><span> </span><a href=""http://recode.net/2015/10/09/twitter-is-planning-company-wide-layoffs-for-next-week/"" target=""_blank"">announced layoffs</a><span> of 8 percent of the company's workforce.</span></p> \n<p>Dorsey is trying to turn Twitter around after a year of poor performance. ""We do not expect to see sustained, meaningful growth in monthly active users until we start to reach the mass market,"" chief financial officer Anthony Noto said at the last earnings call in July. ""We expect that will take a considerable period of time.""</p> \n<p>Twitter's dismal performance prompted one of the company's biggest investors, venture capitalist Chris Sacca, to pen a <a href=""http://lowercasecapital.com/cables/"" target=""_blank"">widely read memo</a> earlier this year discussing Twitter's problems and suggesting some solutions. ""Twitter has failed to meet its own stated user growth expectations and has not been able to take advantage of the massive number of users who have signed up for accounts and then not come back,"" Sacca wrote.</p> \n<p> </p> \n<p class=""p1"">Twitter's basic problem is that it doesn't enjoy the same mass-market appeal of Facebook, which has more than four times as many users. But there's no obvious reason — save maybe the company's valuation — that that should be a problem. Twitter could arguably build a strong business by focusing on its current user base. What it's failing to do is show Facebook-like numbers, which is what Wall Street really wants from Twitter. So Twitter faces pressure to change the core service in ways that could drive off its most loyal fans.</p> \n<h3>Twitter suffered yet another quarter of losses</h3> \n<p>Twitter is one of the internet's most popular sites, with more than 320 million users. But the company has fallen far behind Facebook, and user growth has been stalling recently. Twitter said that it gained just 4 million users, growing from 316 million to 320 million users. For comparison, Facebook has around 1.5 billion users.</p> \n<p><span>And despite large and growing revenues, the company has struggled to turn a profit. Twitter lost $578 million in 2014. In the first six months of 2015, Twitter's revenues were an impressive $938 million, but the company lost $299 million.</span></p> \n<p>On Tuesday, Twitter revealed that the third quarter has brought more of the same. Revenues were $569 million — a significant increase from last year's third-quarter revenues. But the company lost $132 million dollars for the quarter — less than they lost in Q3 2014, but still troubling for a company whose user growth has nearly stopped.</p> \n<h3>Twitter is optimized for power users</h3> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""3779352"" alt=""GettyImages-187222006.0.jpg"" src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3779352/GettyImages-187222006.0.jpg""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">(DAMIEN MEYER/AFP/Getty Images)</p> \n<p><span>Many of Twitter's strengths — and also its weaknesses — come from the fact that tweets in a user's timeline are displayed in strictly chronological order. Any time you log in to Twitter, you see the most recent tweets from people you follow.</span></p> \n<p>This focus on recency makes Twitter indispensable for certain kinds of users. If you're a journalist following a breaking news story, for example, Twitter is by far the best source of information. And for people who sit in front of a computer all day, Twitter is a great way to always stay on top of the latest conversations.</p> \n<p>But presenting tweets in a strict reverse chronological order can make the service less useful to casual users. People whose jobs don't involve sitting in front of a computer might only check in once or twice a day. They care more about seeing the most important information than the most recent. Facebook's newsfeed is designed for these users. It uses a proprietary algorithm to predict which posts users are most likely to care about, ensuring that you see your friends' wedding and pregnancy announcements.</p> \n<p>Until recently, Twitter didn't do this. <span>Because Twitter made little effort to prioritize tweets, users have had to do more work to make it useful. Power users carefully curated the list of people they follow to optimize their Twitter experience. A lot of casual users didn't have time for this, and as a result Twitter felt chaotic and overwhelming to them.</span></p> \n<p>These different schemes for ordering posts have led the two sites to be used in different ways. Facebook has become the most popular way for ordinary users to share personal content with friends and family. Twitter, by contrast, is used in more impersonal ways. People use Twitter to see tweets from their favorite celebrities, journalists, and other public figures, to stay up to date on the news, and to share snarky insights into the news of the day.</p> \n<p>This difference has had huge business consequences because the number of people who want to stay in touch with friends and family is vastly larger than the number of people who want to keep up with current events. Facebook had 1.49 billion monthly active users in June 2015 — more than four times Twitter's 320 million active users.</p> \n<p>And while Facebook's audience is about four and a half times the size of Twitter's, Facebook's revenues are nearly eight times as large.</p> \n<p>Twitter recognizes that this is an issue and has begun experimenting with new features to help casual users get value from the service. Earlier this year, the company added a ""while you were away"" feature to show a handful of popular tweets that were posted since your last login. A few weeks ago, Twitter introduced Twitter Moments, which presents curated collections of tweets about breaking news stories. Twitter is hoping features like this will jump-start the company's growth, but it's too soon to say if the strategy is working.</p> \n<h3>Twitter is falling behind other social media sites</h3> \n<p>By most standards, a company with 320 million users and more than a billion dollars in annual revenue is a big success. But Twitter became a publicly traded company in 2013, and so it faces pressure from Wall Street for continued growth.</p> \n<p>Twitter hasn't delivered:</p> \n<div>\n<img data-chorus-asset-id=""3920888"" alt=""Screen_Shot_2015-07-30_at_11.57.07_AM.0.png"" src=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3920888/Screen_Shot_2015-07-30_at_11.57.07_AM.0.png""> \n<p class=""caption"">(<a href=""http://www.statista.com/statistics/282087/number-of-monthly-active-twitter-users/"" target=""_blank"">Statista</a>)</p> \n<p>In 2012, Twitter added 66 million users for a growth rate of nearly 50 percent. In 2013, the company added 51 million users for a growth rate of 25 percent. In 2014, the company added 47 million users for a growth rate of 18 percent. Between March and June 2015, the company added a paltry 2 million users. Between June and September, Twitter only added 3 million additional users. <span>(All of these figures ignore </span><a href=""http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2015/04/29/twitter-to-enlarge-user-growth-by-counting-sms-only-users/"" target=""_blank"">SMS-only users</a><span>, which have been growing faster in recent quarters — but not that fast.)</span></p> \n<p>Meanwhile, other social networks are passing Twitter in audience size. Instagram (which was <a href=""http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303815404577333840377381670"">acquired by Facebook</a> in 2012)  <a href=""http://techcrunch.com/2014/12/10/not-a-fad/"">became larger than Twitter</a> in late 2014. Snapchat is <a href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/snapchats-monthly-active-users-may-be-nearing-200-million-2014-12"">growing quickly</a> and could surpass Twitter this year.</p> \n<p>This is particularly problematic for Twitter because there are economies of scale in the advertising business. The largest internet companies — currently Google in search and Facebook in social media — can offer advertisers one-stop shopping and extremely accurate ad targeting, generating more revenue per user than a smaller service. Right now, 320 million users might seem like a lot, but in a few years it might not be enough to reach the top tier of social media sites.</p> \n<h3>Twitter is losing a lot of money</h3> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4113302/Screen_Shot_2015-09-30_at_7.11.09_PM.0.png"" alt=""Screen_Shot_2015-09-30_at_7.11.09_PM.0.png"" data-chorus-asset-id=""4113302""></p> \n<p> </p> \n<p class=""caption"">Twitter's stock price is below the level of its 2013 IPO. (<a href=""http://www.msn.com/en-us/money/stockdetails?symbol=US:TWTR"" target=""_blank"">MSN Money</a>)</p> \n<p> </p> \n<p>The pressure on Twitter to accelerate growth helps to explain an otherwise puzzling fact about the company: It's losing a lot of money. In 2014, Twitter lost $578 million, only a little less than the $645 million the company lost in 2013.</p> \n<p>It shouldn't be difficult for a company with 320 million users to turn a profit. And indeed, Twitter took in $1.4 billion revenues in 2014, more than double 2013 revenues of $665 million. But the company's costs grew almost as fast. Twitter spent $692 million on research and development and $614 million on sales and marketing in 2014.</p> \n<p>Twitter lost another <span>$</span>430 million in the first nine months of 2015 — almost as much as the $452 million the company lost in the same period in 2014.</p> \n<p>Losses aren't necessarily a cause for concern if they reflect investments that will produce more rapid growth in the future. Twitter's problem is that it appears to be spending a lot of money on engineering and marketing initiatives that don't seem to be producing much growth.</p> \n<h3>Twitter is trying to improve its reputation among third-party developers</h3> \n<p><span>One of Twitter's strengths in its early years was a vibrant ecosystem of third-party developers. For example, when the iPhone ushered in the modern smartphone era in 2007, Twitter was relatively slow to introduce a mobile Twitter app. But luckily, Twitter was an open platform, and third parties stepped in to provide the mobile app customers demanded.</span></p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""right""><span>It shouldn't be difficult for a company with 320 million users to turn a profit</span></q></p> \n<p>But everything changed in 2012, when Twitter <a href=""https://blog.twitter.com/2012/changes-coming-to-twitter-api"">effectively killed off</a> third-party Twitter apps. It did this because the fragmentation of Twitter users across multiple apps made it harder for Twitter to provide a consistent user experience. Also, the popularity of third-party apps made it harder for Twitter to generate ad revenue.</p> \n<p>But killing third-party clients had long-run costs. By souring third-party developers on the platform, Twitter deprived itself of an important source of new ideas for expanding the Twitter ecosystem. Now ideas for expanding Twitter have to come from Twitter itself. And in the past couple of years, these ideas have been few and far between.</p> \n<p>Twitter's new CEO, Jack Dorsey, recognizes that this is a problem, and he's been working hard to win back developers' support. Last week, he <a href=""http://www.theverge.com/2015/10/21/9586084/jack-dorsey-twitter-ceo-apology-developers"" target=""_blank"">publicly apologized</a> for Twitter's previous behavior and asked developers to give him another chance.</p> \n<h3>People have a lot of ideas for fixing Twitter</h3> \n<p>As Twitter has posted quarter after quarter of poor financial results, a wide variety of people have weighed in with ideas for how the social media company can pull out of its current slump.</p> \n<p><strong>Focus on becoming more accessible.</strong> This is probably the most common suggestion, and it's the direction Twitter appears to be headed in. The basic idea is that ordinary users find today's Twitter confusing and overwhelming, and Twitter should work on ways to make the wealth of information it presents more accessible to casual users. For example, earlier this year investor Chris Sacca <a href=""http://lowercasecapital.com/2015/06/03/what-twitter-can-be-2/"">wrote a memo</a> suggesting  that<span> Twitter build a series of channels that allow people to quickly find information about particular topics, like a sports team, TV show, or election. Dorsey appears to have taken this suggestion to heart, as the recently introduced Moments feature does this.</span></p> \n<p>Sacca also encourages Twitter to relax the assumption that tweets should appear in strictly reverse chronological order. Instead, when a user logs in, the platform should show a selection of the most interesting and insightful tweets that would have appeared on the user's timeline since the last check-in. Twitter took a small step in this direction earlier this year with its ""while you were away"" feature, but Twitter's interface is still fundamentally based on showing the most recent tweets.</p> \n<p>The counterargument, which I made <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/7/29/9067419/twitter-facebook-jack-dorsey"" target=""_blank"">here</a>, is that a more accessible version of Twitter already exists. It's called Facebook, and it's wildly popular. The danger is that aping Facebook might alienate existing users more quickly than it attracts new ones.</p> \n<p><strong>Refocus on third-party apps.</strong> Another option, <a href=""https://stratechery.com/2015/twitter-might/"">promoted by analyst Ben Thompson</a>, would be to build lots of different apps that allow people to interact with the Twitter platform in different ways. Different apps could target different types of users, with some offering advanced features to power users, while others provide casual users with simplified ways to extract value from Twitter's firehose of information.</p> \n<p>The best way to do this would be to encourage third parties to build Twitter apps. But that's tricky because Twitter has burned a lot of bridges with developers since 2012. Dorsey's recent public apology to developers is an effort to repair these relationships and encourage more people to build for Twitter's platform.</p> \n<p><strong>Sell to Google.</strong> One of Twitter's most valuable assets is an unrivaled view into what's happening at this very instant. That knowledge could prove very useful to Google, whose mission is to ""organize the world's information."" Earlier this year Google and Twitter <a href=""http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-02-05/twitter-said-to-reach-deal-for-tweets-in-google-search-results"">signed a deal</a> to make it easier for Google to index tweets in real time. But if Twitter were a Google subsidiary, the search giant might find even more ways to extract value from this data — without requiring significant changes to the primary Twitter app.</p> \n<p>The big problem here is that Twitter is probably too expensive. Twitter is currently worth about $20 billion, which is a lot of money even for a behemoth like Google. And Google may be able to accomplish many of the same goals at a small fraction of the price with the kind of strategic partnership the company signed earlier this year.</p> \n<p><strong>Just focus on power users.</strong> A final option, <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/5/1/5672102/twitter-is-no-facebook-and-thats-fine"">advocated</a> by Vox's Matt Yglesias, is to simply accept that Twitter is never going to be a mass-market product on the scale of Facebook, and focus on serving the 320 million passionate users it has now as well as possible. This option would entail cutting back dramatically on research and marketing spending so that Twitter could earn a profit with limited revenue. The company might also focus more on selling premium ads targeted at its highly influential user base.</p> \n<p>The problem with this option is that Wall Street would hate it. The company's current valuation of $20 billion is based on an assumption that the company will continue growing. Dorsey will face a lot of pressure to deliver on that expectation.</p> \n<hr> \n<h3>Vox Video: Using Twitter to debunk silly shows</h3> \n<div class=""volume-video"" id=""volume-placement-706"" data-volume-placement=""article"" data-analytics-placement=""middle"" data-volume-id=""608"" data-volume-uuid=""eff0514f0"" data-analytics-label=""Discovery's &quot;Eaten Alive&quot; fact-checked on twitter | 608"" data-analytics-action=""volume:view:middle"" data-analytics-viewport=""video""></div> \n<!--  ########  END VOLUME VIDEO  ########  -->\n</div>",Business & Finance

The Murdoch family, through a trust, owns about a third of the total shares in 21st Century Fox, and the lack of any other large shareholding blocks means they largely have control of the enterprise. But their wealth is heavily tied up in the value of those shares, which in turn is driven by buying and selling on the broad stock market.</p> \n<p>So even though nobody can stop Rupert from turning the company over to his sons, the Murdochs need to maintain the confidence of public markets to stay rich. In early trading, Fox shares were down modestly on the news.</p> \n<h3>The Murdochs also own another company</h3> \n<p>Until relatively recently, the assets controlled by 21st Century Fox were part of a company called News Corp that evolved out of Rupert Murdoch's original business owning Australian newspapers. A few years back, Murdoch made the decision to split his conglomerate into two smaller conglomerates. One, the company now called News Corp, owns newspapers (including, most notably, the Wall Street Journal) and a book publishing house. The other, the company Murdoch is stepping down from as CEO, owns television networks and TV and film production studios.</p> \n<p>This division makes business sense, but aligns imperfectly with the two faces Murdoch presents to the public.</p> \n<p>He is, on the one hand, an entertainment entrepreneur. He is, on the other hand, a force in partisan politics, with properties like Fox News and the Sun that wield substantial influence on three continents.

While most people today know Murdoch for his controversial politics, Murdoch's biggest impact was as a media innovator.</p> \n<p>For decades, Murdoch was at the forefront of the media world's major trends. He was a pioneer in digital newspaper publishing, tabloid news, broadcasting, and cable and satellite television. In each of these media, he saw big opportunities and invested heavily (and in some cases waged bitter political fights) to build big and ultimately profitable business. Murdoch's repeated successes over more than four decades and on three continents makes him one of the most talented media executives of the 20th century.</p> \n<p>Only in the past decade has Murdoch's business savvy begun to fail him. As the internet has become an increasingly important part of the media landscape, Murdoch has failed to come up with an effective strategy for capitalizing on it.</p> \n<h3>Murdoch was an aggressive and savvy newspaper mogul</h3> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""3782524"" alt=""GettyImages-122187108.0.jpg"" src=""https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3782524/GettyImages-122187108.0.jpg""></p> \n<p> </p> \n<p class=""caption"">Print unions picketing the News International print plant at Wapping after Rupert Murdoch had set up a non-unionized plant, 1986. (Michael Ward/Getty Images)</p> \n<p> </p> \n<p>In the United States, people mostly think of Rupert Murdoch as the man behind the Fox television empire. But he got his start in the newspaper business before he jumped into other media.</p> \n<p>Murdoch is a native of Australia, and his career as a media mogul began in 1952, when his father died and left 21-year-old Rupert a chain of Australian newspapers. The younger Murdoch proved to be a savvy businessman, and steadily built up his news empire in Australia. He launched the Australian, a national newspaper for Australia, in 1964.</p> \n<p>He then made a jump to the United Kingdom, buying News of the World in 1968, the Sun in 1969, and the Times in 1981. To cut costs, Murdoch consolidated these newspapers' printing operations and began to shift the papers to new digital publishing technologies.</p> \n<p>These changes ran afoul of existing labor rules, known as ""Spanish practices,"" which led to a <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/jul/27/rupert-murdoch-wapping-25-years"">war with the industry's unions</a>, who saw the changes as a threat to their jobs. The conflicts turned violent — according to the Guardian, 1,262 people were arrested, and 410 police were injured during months of demonstrations. But Murdoch prevailed, gaining a more flexible workforce and a more efficient printing process.</p> \n<p>According to the Guardian, ""many in the newspaper business — including some who criticized Murdoch at the time — now concede"" that Murdoch's triumph ""probably helped prolong the life of the British press by a good few decades.""</p> \n<h3>Murdoch relied on sexual titillation and political outrage to build an audience</h3> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""3782548"" alt=""GettyImages-51417984.0.jpg"" src=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3782548/GettyImages-51417984.0.jpg""></p> \n<p> </p> \n<p class=""caption"">A cover of the Sun in 1998. (GERRY PENNY/AFP/Getty Images)</p> \n<p> </p> \n<p>When Murdoch acquired the British newspaper the Sun, he soon inaugurated the ""Page 3 girl,"" a photo of a topless woman that appeared inside the cover of almost every issue of the newspaper. Traditionalists were outraged, but the racy images helped make the Sun Britain's highest-circulation paper, a distinction it still holds today.</p> \n<p>Other Murdoch properties have been equally willing to use racy content to boost circulation. The New York Post, which Murdoch acquired in 1976, has become famous for its sensationalistic headlines and focus on tawdry stories. The paper's most famous headline is probably ""Headless body in topless bar,"" about a <a href=""http://nypost.com/2015/06/09/new-york-post-editor-and-film-critic-vincent-musetto-dies-at-74/"">grisly 1983 incident</a> in which a gunman forced a woman to decapitate the owner of the bar. (The <a href=""http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2015/06/10/_headless_body_in_topless_bar_writer_dies_but_why_was_that_headless_body.html"" target=""_blank"">author of that headline died</a> on Tuesday.)</p> \n<p>Murdoch's newspapers have also gotten a lot of mileage out of political controversies. For example, when Britain went to war against Argentina for control over the Falkland Islands in 1982, Murdoch's papers cheered on British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's aggressive posture in the conflict. Critics <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/media/2002/feb/25/pressandpublishing.falklands"">derided</a> the Sun for its ""xenophobic, bloody-minded, ruthless, often reckless, black-humoured and ultimately triumphalist"" coverage. But the nationalistic coverage helped to boost the Sun's circulation.</p> \n<p>Both traits — sexual titillation and jingoistic political coverage — are evident in one of Murdoch's most famous American ventures, Fox News. Fox News anchors like Bill O'Reilly and Sean Hannity play to the political prejudices of the network's conservative audiences with coverage that's often partisan and sensationalistic. At the same time, Fox News <a href=""http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2014/11/how-libertine-culture-conquered-conservative-media/382760/"">rarely misses an opportunity</a> to broadcast images of scantily clad women.</p> \n<h3>Murdoch helped to break the stranglehold of television's ""Big Three""</h3> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""3782564"" alt=""married.0.png"" src=""https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3782564/married.0.png""></p> \n<p> </p> \n<p class=""caption""><i>Married with Children</i> was one of Fox's first hits. (Fox Network/Getty Images)</p> \n<p> </p> \n<p>It's hard to believe today, but there was an era when most Americans had only three options for television content: NBC, ABC, and CBS. This was partly because the primitive technologies of the 1960s and 1970s made running a television network really expensive. And a variety of FCC regulations made it difficult for smaller networks to gain traction. In the early 1980s, it had been decades since someone had successfully launched a new television network in the United States.</p> \n<p>In 1985, Murdoch acquired a string of six television stations in major markets that formed the core of the Fox television network. While the network struggled in its first few years, it soon began to thrive with hits such as <em>Married with Children</em>, <em>The Simpsons</em>, <em>Cops</em>, and <em>America's Most Wanted</em>.</p> \n<p>Fox consolidated its status as a major network in 1993 when it signed a $1.58 billion deal to carry National Football League games, including the 1997 Super Bowl. The lure of football and some further acquisitions helped Murdoch build Fox into a truly national network.

Cable television wasn't exactly a new concept in the 1990s, but Murdoch was savvy enough to recognize that the medium offered huge growth opportunities at that time.</p> \n<p>Murdoch launched the FX (""Fox Extended"") network in 1994, as well as a network of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Sports_(United_States)"">Fox-branded sports channels</a>. Murdoch's greatest impact came with Fox News. While it bore the tagline ""fair and balanced,"" critics charged that it was anything but, with a conservative slant that permeated its coverage. Still, the channel became a huge hit, attracting a loyal audience of mostly conservative viewers that appreciated its lively, often bombastic coverage.</p> \n<p>Murdoch was also an early innovator in satellite television. He acquired a majority stake in the British satellite TV company Sky in 1983. Murdoch merged Sky with British Satellite Broadcasting in 1990 and turned it into the dominant force in the British satellite television business, with 11 million subscribers.</p> \n<h3>Murdoch has floundered in the internet era</h3> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""3782600"" alt=""GettyImages-108759578.0.jpg"" src=""https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3782600/GettyImages-108759578.0.jpg""></p> \n<p> </p> \n<p class=""caption"">Murdoch with Apple's Eddie Cue at the launch of the Daily in 2011. (Charles Eshelman/FilmMagic)</p> \n<p> </p> \n<p>For three decades, Murdoch managed to anticipate and capitalize on shifting media technologies: digital printing, satellite television, and cable television. He built big, profitable companies for each medium. But he's never figured out how to do that for the internet.</p> \n<p>His most ambitious effort was the Daily, an iPad app Murdoch launched in 2011. Murdoch spent tens of millions of dollars on the project, which had a staff of <a href=""http://www.politico.com/blogs/media/2012/07/murdochs-daily-lays-off-staffers-130657.html"">170 people</a> at its peak. But it was <a href=""http://www.politico.com/blogs/media/2012/12/murdochs-the-daily-to-shut-down-150872.html"">shuttered</a> after less than two years in operation.</p> \n<p>The Daily's basic problem was that it tried to reproduce the experience of a newspaper — in which consumers pay a subscription to access a bundle of daily content — at a time when internet news was becoming increasingly unbundled. Most people don't want to sit down and read the news cover to cover on an iPad app; they find news one article at a time using services like Facebook, Reddit, and Google News. The Daily walled itself off from the rest of the internet, and as a result, the rest of the internet mostly ignored it.</p>",Business & Finance

But most of all, worries that the bull market has lasted too long.","<p>On Friday, August 21, American stock markets had a really bad day with the broad S&amp;P 500 index (roughly the 500 biggest companies listed on US stock markets) losing well over 3 percent of its value — a plunge that was followed by further declines over the weekend and on Monday morning.</p> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""3990852""><img src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3990852/Screen%20Shot%202015-08-22%20at%201.19.48%20PM.png""></div> \n<p>The fall, though certainly large, was by no means catastrophic by historical standards.

But while economic growth since that time has been generally disappointing, the stock market has soared.</p> \n<p>In 2015, though, that pattern has broken down.</p> \n<p>The economy continues to add jobs at a slow but steady pace, but the S&amp;P index started the year at 2,058 on January 2 and was at 2,060 as of early Thursday morning — dead in the water. In that context, the sudden decline on Friday feels to many like a bad portent, a clear signal that a years-long bull market is over and now the bears are running the show.</p> \n<p>It's a huge deal for investment professionals, and a sustained downturn could be very bad for people near retirement. But it's always worth keeping in mind that most people don't have much to fear from a stock market decline — even a severe one.</p> \n<h3>1) Bad news from China supposedly caused the crash</h3> \n<p>The truth is that nobody has any idea what causes short-term stock market fluctuations. And to the extent that anyone even <em>thinks</em> they have a way of finding out, they're not going to tell you about it or blab to the press — they're going to trade and make money.</p> \n<p>But broadly speaking the key source of negative sentiment seems to be a run of bad economic news out of China. This has been a <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/7/9/8922121/chinas-economy-stock-market-crisis"">story all summer</a>, but the <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/8/13/9149953/chinese-currency-devaluation-explained"">declining price of Chinese currency</a> since mid-August has made it clear that there are real international implications.</p> \n<p>You can see the central role of China-related fears in the extraordinarily poor performance of companies like Apple (down more than 6 percent) that have relied on Chinese customers to fuel much of their recent growth. The China effect is also visible in the price of a wide range of raw materials, all of which are falling in anticipation of weaker Asian demand.</p> \n<p>None of this really explains why Friday in particular was so bad (Chinese growth was also slowing on Wednesday), but it's what traders are thinking about.</p> \n<h3>2) The stock market's had a great run</h3> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""3992534""><img src=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3992534/Screen%20Shot%202015-08-23%20at%206.25.53%20AM.png""></div> \n<p>Since bottoming out in the spring of 2009, US stock markets have enjoyed an excellent run. There have been some hiccups in the years-long bull market, especially centered on America's sporadic political crises, but mostly it's been an era of up, up, and away for American stocks.</p> \n<p>In part, this is because the economy has grown steadily this whole time.</p> \n<p>But overall economic growth has still been much less impressive than stock market performance. The excess performance of stocks has been driven by a few factors:</p> \n<ul> \n<li>With wage growth slow, the corporate profit share of overall national income has risen, partially offsetting overall national income's slow growth.</li> \n<li>Many big US-based companies have plenty of foreign customers, and have benefited from stronger growth in Asia even as the US economy has been weak.</li> \n<li>Low interest rates have made it possible for many companies to borrow money cheaply in order to spend on share-boosting strategies like higher dividends or companies buying shares of their own stock. </li> \n<li>Optimism that more robust recovery is right around the corner. </li> \n</ul> \n<h3>3) The stock market's had a bad 2015</h3> \n<p>In 2015, that party largely came to an end. The profit share of the economy appears to be shrinking again, as the unemployment rate is now lower and companies no longer have a limitless supply of cheap labor. At the same time, the foreign economic picture now looks very different. The Brazilian and Russian economies are both in a state of chaos, and Chinese growth is — at best — slowing down.</p> \n<h3>4) Weak stock prices might not be bad for you</h3> \n<p>If you are in your 60s, hoping to retire very soon, and have most of the money that you have managed to save tied up in the stock market, then a period of low stock prices is bad news. But while much economic commentary simply assumes that low share prices are bad, the reality is that relatively few people are actually in this situation. If you're not planning to retire for another two or three or four decades, then cheaper stocks are, if anything, a plus — it means your savings will go further as a long-term investment.</p> \n<p>What's more, for better or worse most people just don't save that much, and the majority of stock is owned by a relatively small number of rich people.</p> \n<p>To the extent that things like a stronger labor market and higher wages are weighing down profits and share prices, that's good for most people. To the extent that weak economic growth in Brazil and China is weighing down share prices, that's terrible for Brazilians and Chinese people but probably doesn't mean much one way or the other to you.</p> \n<h3>5) Then again, it could be a sign of something terrible</h3> \n<p>It's unlikely that declining stock prices will <em>cause</em> bad things in the life of the typical American. But rapid movements in financial markets are sometimes a <em>sign</em> of larger problems.</p> \n<p>If American economic growth is slowing down, that's going to be bad for most Americans. And slower US growth is the kind of thing that would show up in US stock market prices — probably faster and more suddenly than it would become visible in official government economic data. Most people don't seem to think that's what's happening here, so you shouldn't get too worried. But anyone who was really 100 percent confident they could understand the ups and downs of financial markets would be getting rich, not writing about it on the internet, so it's best to admit to some uncertainty about what's really happening.</p>",Business & Finance

The most important question about the August stock slide,http://www.vox.com/2015/8/24/9198129/should-i-worry-about-stock-market-crash,History says this could be terrible news. Or it could be fine.,"<p>As the US stock market heads into what looks to be its worst month in more than five years, the big question for the average person's life is this: Are we watching a replay of 2008 or a replay of 1987? If it's the former, you should freak out. If it's the latter, <a href=""http://vox.com/2015/8/24/9197197/stock-crash-advice"">you just need to hold tight</a>.</p> \n<p>It could be really bad, or it could be not so bad. But here's what we do know: The price of stocks declining is unlikely to be the <em>cause</em> of bad things in your life. If it's bad news, it's bad news simply because stock markets offer a fast and highly visible window into economic conditions.</p> \n<ul> \n<li> If massive layoffs and a general collapse in business conditions are in the works, then the exact same things that cause those are likely to cause a stock market decline. </li> \n<li>But then again, history also shows us that sometimes there are sudden moves in financial markets that don't signify anything at all. </li> \n</ul> \n<h3>In 2008, falling stocks were a sign of a tumbling economy</h3> \n<p>It's unlikely that anybody lost their job during the Great Recession <em>because</em> the price of stocks fell. Some people probably lost jobs because of the falling price of commodities (food, oil, metal, and other raw materials), because lower prices mean less incentive to produce more. But then again, falling commodity prices are <em>good</em> for most people and sometimes provide the economy with a boost.</p> \n<p>Nonetheless, the large decline in stock prices that happened in the fall of 2008 was bad news for the vast majority of Americans.</p> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""3995668""><img src=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3995668/Screen%20Shot%202015-08-24%20at%2011.09.44%20AM.png""></div> \n<p>That's because the crash was, in effect, a warning sign that was ignored. Financial markets were signaling an expectation that the outlook for business profits was getting much worse. Commodity prices were signaling an expectation that overall levels of demand would plunge. These dire predictions proved to be 100 percent accurate. It takes weeks and even months for all the relevant data about the performance of the real economy to pile up. But stock markets can move really quickly. Bad things were happening.</p> \n<h3>In 1987, markets plunged and then ... nothing happened</h3> \n<p>Twenty years earlier, though, a similarly dramatic collapse in stock prices had a very different result. Here's how it looked in the heat of the market panic:</p> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""3995720""><img src=""https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3995720/disaster.png""></div> \n<p>But there was no late-Reagan-era recession. No global economic catastrophe. Instead, it looks in retrospect like investors just panicked for no good reason. Or maybe that they had good reason, but then Alan Greenspan moved swiftly to nip it in the bud. Either way, the downturn actually lasted quite a while even though nothing special was happening in the real economy.</p> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""3995728""><img src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3995728/meh.png""></div> \n<p>Eventually, stocks went back up. After all, nothing bad was going on, so why shouldn't they have?</p> \n<h3>Bottom line: Be concerned, but not too concerned</h3> \n<p>The <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/8/23/9194057/why-are-stocks-down-august"">August stock slide</a> is a clear sign that investors are worried about corporate America's performance outlook, and since plenty of people work for big American companies, that's reason to be concerned. But not <em>too</em> concerned.</p> \n<p>There's no particular reason that cheaper stock prices should <em>cause</em> anything bad to happen to the vast majority of people. A sharp decline in house prices has a huge impact on the real economy because middle-class Americans have so much of their net wealth tied up in houses they bought with borrowed money. The stock market isn't like that. Shares are mostly owned by rich people, and middle-class Americans don't borrow money to buy stocks.</p> \n<p>Similarly, though the weak Chinese economy is definitely bad news for Apple and a handful of other American companies with lots of Chinese customers, US exports to China are not that big of a deal overall. Meanwhile, the falling price of oil helps the US trade balance and puts money into the pockets of most people.</p> \n<p>So there's a great chance that everything will be fine. But policymakers at the Federal Reserve — and, were it actually a functioning policymaking body, the US Congress — ought to be vigilant. US stocks in decline could be an early sign of some more profound weakness. On Thursday, the Commerce Department will report on second-quarter GDP, and on Friday it will tell us about personal income in July. We'll also get data this week about initial unemployment claims. A stock market decline doesn't necessarily mean anything terrible for the real economy, but it is important context with which to read those reports when they're out.</p>",Business & Finance

How bad was Monday's stock market crash? This chart puts it in context.,http://www.vox.com/2015/8/24/9201725/stock-market-crash-chart,Monday's stock market crash was the largest since 2011.,"<p><img src=""https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3997194/dow-losses-compared.jpg"" alt=""Dow Jones largest one day losses graphic"" data-chorus-asset-id=""3997194""></p> \n<p> </p> \n<p class=""caption"">(Javier Zarracina/Vox)</p> \n<p> </p> \n<p><span>On Monday, the stock market posted its largest decline in years, sparking fear that the US is on the verge of another recession.

Here are the biggest stock market declines since the 1980s:</p> \n<ul> \n<li>The chart is dominated by October 19, 1987, when the stock market plunged by 22 percent. This huge drop wasn't followed by a recession, and the market recovered the lost ground within two years.</li> \n<li>There were big declines in October 1997 and August 1998. Again, these proved not to have any broader significance, as the bull market would continue until 2000.</li> \n<li>There were three big drops during the 2000-'01 bear market that preceded the recession of the early George W. Bush years.</li> \n<li>The stock market suffered 11 big drops in the last four months of 2008, during the Great Recession that was officially under way by then.</li> \n<li>In August 2011, the stock market panicked over the possibility that President Obama and congressional Republicans would be unable to resolve the debt ceiling fight, leading to three big declines.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>So sometimes a big stock market decline is a sign of deeper economic problems. Other times, it's not. It's too early to say which category Monday's crash is in.</p> \n<p><b>Correction:</b> I originally stated that the Great Recession occurred after the 2008 stock market crashes, but it began in 2007.</p>",Business & Finance
Janet Yellen made the right call,http://www.vox.com/2015/8/27/9215629/september-fed-interest-rates,"People think it's time to take the economy off life support, but low interest rates aren't a breathing tube.","<p>The Federal Reserve made big news today by doing nothing — <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/9/16/9340469/federal-reserve-rate-decision"">higher interest rates</a> are not coming this month.</p> \n<p>That's the outcome that most observers were expecting over the past week, but a considerable minority of voices has been calling for higher interest rates all summer. The economy, after all, is much stronger right now than it was five or three or even one year ago. We could surely survive without the extroardinary expedient of super-low interest rates.</p> \n<p>After all, when you see a person in the hospital with oxygen tubes in her nose and a saline drip in her arm, you assume the doctors have done this for some good reason. Most likely, if the tubes were removed the patient's health would be in serious jeopardy. But all else being equal, having tubes stuck in you is a pretty crappy situation. It's uncomfortable, and it limits your mobility. As soon as it's safe, you'd want to pull the tubes out.<strong> </strong>Now that the emergency created by the 2008 financial crisis is over, some people are anxious to pull the tube out and let the patient get back to living a normal life.</p> \n<p>But there's actually no reason to think low interest rates are a problem for the US economy. Low interest rates reduce the federal deficit, encourage entrepreneurship, and boost economic growth. As long as inflation stays low — and right now, it's extremely low and likely to stay that way for a long time — we should relax and enjoy the benefits.</p> \n<h3>The perverse urge to normalize</h3> \n<p>Back in early August, the conventional wisdom was that the Federal Reserve would finally raise interest rates for the first time since house prices started to collapse more than seven years ago. Then the financial trauma coming out of Asia cast doubt on that. William Dudley, the influential president of the New York Fed, said recent events made a rate hike <a href=""http://www.wsj.com/articles/feds-dudley-says-new-york-economy-is-a-bright-spot-1440597601"">""less compelling,""</a> and, partly as a result, US markets have been soaring ever since.</p> \n<p>But Dudley also said, ""I really do hope we can raise interest rates this year,"" and, most of all, that there's no reason to be thinking about new efforts at monetary stimulus: ""I’m a long way from quantitative easing. The US economy is performing quite well.""</p> \n<p>This central analytic mistake is repeated daily on financial television shows, on ""finance Twitter,"" in the business press, and apparently in staff-level discussions in the Federal Reserve. The conceit is that raising interest rates is a good thing, and the Fed should do it as soon as possible. Debate is entirely focused on whether higher rates would be catastrophic. Any good economic news counts as a reason to think they wouldn't be and therefore should come sooner.</p> \n<p>In order to make it seem more obvious that higher interest rates are good, proponents of higher interest rates have taken to calling higher interest rates ""normalizing"" monetary policy. Normal things are good, right? Who could be against normal?</p> \n<h3>The case for low interest rates</h3> \n<p>But this is both totally wrong and a remarkably recent idea.</p> \n<p>Back in the 1990s, the Clinton administration wanted to reduce the budget deficit because they perceived that a lower deficit would lead to lower interest rates, which would bring a positive impact to the economy. Back in 2009 when the Great Recession and the Obama stimulus were making the deficit very big, critics warned (wrongly) that ""bond vigilantes"" would <a href=""http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/11/19/invisible-bond-vigilantes/"">wreck the US economy by bringing higher interest rates</a>.</p> \n<p>People knew, in other words, that all else being equal, low interest rates are good. Let me count the ways:</p> \n<ul> \n<li>Low rates make it easier for younger and more cash-strapped people to buy houses, cars, and other durable goods.</li> \n<li>Increased demand for durable goods creates more employment opportunities for building and installing those goods. </li> \n<li>Low rates reduce the need for the federal government to increase taxes or reduce spending. </li> \n<li>Low rates make it easier for state and local governments to make physical infrastructure investments with long-term payoffs. </li> \n<li>Low rates mean that people with money who are hoping to earn a decent return need to seek out more adventurous investment opportunities, making it much easier for innovators and entrepreneurs to obtain funding. </li> \n</ul> \n<p>The last point is worth dwelling on. Many people see the relationship between <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/5/28/8679725/bubbles-interest-rates"">low interest rates and high-tech investments</a> and say that they see a ""bubble."" The relationship is real, but this is not what a bubble is. Low interest rates are part of the fundamentals of the American economy, and have been for years now. One thing that happens in an economy that has low interest rates is that money flows into the hands of entrepreneurs and innovators rather than being tied up exclusively in financing government debts and plain vanilla mortgages. Having an economy that is friendly to entrepreneurs and innovators is good. It's a reason to hope interest rates stay low.</p> \n<h3>Inflation is very low</h3> \n<p>Of course, just because low interest rates are good doesn't mean that you should <em>never</em> raise rates. A central bank that's determined to keep rates low forever regardless of what happens would eventually overheat the economy and produce troubling levels of inflation.</p> \n<p>But the United States does not currently have an inflation problem:</p> \n<ul> \n<li>Inflation has run below the Fed's 2 percent target for several years now.</li> \n<li>Inflation is currently falling, due to falling global commodity prices and a rising US dollar.</li> \n<li>Market-based expectations of inflation indicate that people do not think inflation will go above the 2 percent target on a consistent basis for more than 10 years.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>There is an interesting academic question of how much more the US economy can grow before an inflation problem emerges. My view is that it could probably grow quite a bit, but any honest person has to admit there's a lot of uncertainty here. The clearer issue is that there's little risk in trying to find out and considerable benefit to keeping rates as low as possible for as long as possible.</p> \n<h3>Bold central banking is a boon to the marginalized</h3> \n<p>At a recent congressional hearing, Fed Chair <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/janet-yellen-federal-reserve-jobless-african-americans_55a6c9e1e4b04740a3dee7d3"">Janet Yellen was asked about the black-white unemployment gap</a> and said basically that there's nothing she can do about it. If you delve into the data, it's easy enough to see what she means — the African-American unemployment rate and the white unemployment rate move in tandem, at a 2-to-1 ratio that seems to be fixed by factors that are out of control of monetary policy.</p> \n<p>But as <a href=""http://jaredbernsteinblog.com/the-fed-and-african-american-unemployment/"">Jared Bernstein points out</a>, this semi-fixed ratio actually means that monetary policy matters a great deal for the racial gap. If white unemployment goes from 10 percent to 5 percent, the Fed has achieved a 5 percentage point reduction. At the same time, we would expect black unemployment to fall from 20 percent to 10 percent — a much larger 10 percentage point reduction.</p> \n<p>With the United States currently enjoying a lowish 5.5 percent unemployment rate, it's easy for relatively privileged people to neglect the benefits of further small reductions. But for an African-American population that will enjoy a double-scale version of any drop in the unemployment rate, the stakes remain quite high.</p> \n<p>The same is true of other kinds of vulnerable populations. The college-educated cohort that dominates discussion of economic policy <em>already</em> has a very low unemployment rate. But working-class Americans could see considerable benefit from a stronger labor market.</p> \n<h3>A real return to normal</h3> \n<p>What the Fed needs to do is redefine its conception of normalizing policy. Normal monetary policy is pretty simple — higher interest rates when needed to fight inflation, but not otherwise.</p> \n<p>That's what normal monetary policy looks like. It's true that slowing population growth, aging, higher levels of foreign savings, and other factors seem to be systematically pushing interest rates to a level below what's historically normal. But it's also true that the US population is older and slower-growing than what's historically normal, which is true of other wealthy countries as well. Things change over time. What shouldn't change is the basic philosophy that tighter money is a solution to a specific problem — economic overheating — not a goal to be pursued at the soonest possible moment.</p> \n<h3>VIDEO: How the rich stole the recovery</h3> \n<!--  ########  BEGIN VOLUME VIDEO  ########  --> \n<div class=""volume-video"" id=""volume-placement-5877"" data-volume-placement=""article"" data-analytics-placement=""article:middle"" data-volume-id=""324"" data-volume-uuid=""002e9938e"" data-analytics-label=""Chart: How the rich stole the recovery | 324"" data-analytics-action=""volume:view:article:middle"" data-analytics-viewport=""video""></div> \n<!--  ########  END VOLUME VIDEO  ########  -->",Business & Finance
"College could cost up to $100,000 per year by 2030. Hereâ€™s how to save.",http://www.vox.com/personal-finance/2015/8/28/9217075/save-for-college,Put your retirement first. Then worry about college costs.,"<p>When today's 18-year-old college freshmen were born, the <a href=""http://www.collegeboard.com/prod_downloads/about/news_info/trends/trends_pricing_07.pdf"">average tuition at a public university</a> was $3,111. At a private university, it was $13,785. Since then, the price of college has risen far faster than inflation: Tuition has tripled at public universities and more than doubled at private universities.</p> \n<p>That creates a dilemma for today's parents. It's a safe bet that college will be more expensive by the time their kids get to college. But they don't know how much more expensive, which makes it hard to figure out how much to save.</p> \n<p>One way to get a ballpark figure is to assume that college costs will continue increasing at their current rate. It already costs about $60,000 per year to attend a top-tier private college.<strong> </strong>If college costs keep climbing, that college will cost more than $100,000 per year in 2030. To afford it, the parents of a 3-year-old would <a href=""http://www.savingforcollege.com/college-savings-calculator/index.php?current_cost=60%2C000&amp;years_until_college=15&amp;years_attendance=4&amp;attendance_rate=100&amp;coverage_rate=100&amp;save_until=ends&amp;starting_balance=0&amp;contribution_rate=12&amp;inflation_rate=4&amp;investment_performance=6&amp;page=results"">need to begin investing about $1,300 per month</a>.</p> \n<p>But the way the financial aid system works actually makes the decision a bit simpler for the average parent. That's because you'll come out ahead financially if you max out tax-free retirement savings options before putting any money in a college savings fund. And since the contribution limits on IRA and 401(k) accounts are higher than most people can afford, that means most parents should just focus on saving as much as possible for retirement.</p> \n<h3>You probably won't have to pay the sticker price</h3> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3962712/shutterstock_256831387.0.jpg"" alt=""Chart of a graph on a blackboard with a piggy bank"" data-chorus-asset-id=""3962712""></p> \n<p> </p> \n<p class=""caption"">Save for retirement first. Then save early and often for college. (<a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.shutterstock.com"">Shutterstock</a>)</p> \n<p> </p> \n<p>The most expensive private colleges now cost more than $60,000 per year. But you shouldn't panic, because most people don't pay close to that amount. After financial aid, the typical family pays $23,550 per year at a private college and $12,830 at a public university.</p> \n<p>The most prestigious colleges have financial aid programs that reach well into the upper middle class. Stanford's tuition is free for families making less than $125,000 per year. At Harvard, families making up to $180,000 pay a percentage of their income rather than the full tuition.</p> \n<p>Financial aid programs this generous are rare, but financial aid for students even from well-off families is not. About two-thirds of private college students get some kind of financial aid from the college itself, and that includes more than half of students from the wealthiest quartile, those from families with an income of over $106,000 per year. On average, students at nonprofit colleges get about $18,870 per year in grants and tax benefits.</p> \n<p>Whether you've saved money for your child's education will obviously affect whether they're eligible for grants based on financial need. Assets saved in the child's name <a href=""http://www.finaid.org/savings/accountownership.phtml"">count against their financial aid eligibility</a> more than assets in the parents' names.</p> \n<p>But need-based financial aid isn't the only kind — there are also scholarships based on academics, and more nebulous ""merit-based aid"" that sometimes is just used to attract students to attend one college rather than another.</p> \n<h3>Save for retirement first, college second</h3> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2377588/shutterstock_98725502.0.jpg"" alt=""Retirement"" data-chorus-asset-id=""2377588""></p> \n<p> </p> \n<p class=""caption"">""I'm so glad we put money in our IRA first."" (<a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.shutterstock.com"">Shutterstock</a>)</p> \n<p> </p> \n<p>It might seem like you face a difficult choice between saving for your child's education and your own retirement. But almost all financial experts <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://money.usnews.com/money/retirement/articles/2015/05/11/how-to-prioritize-retirement-versus-college-savings"">say</a> this isn't actually a tough call: You should save for retirement first. Before you start putting money away for college, make the maximum contributions to your retirement accounts, such as a 401(k) and an individual retirement account.</p> \n<p>There are three reasons for this. One is that it's easier to find another way to afford college — grants, loans, or a cheaper option, like transferring from a community college to a four-year university — than it is to support yourself in retirement.</p> \n<p>Second, retirement accounts aren't counted when colleges and the federal government figure out eligibility for financial aid. The government expects parents to contribute up to 6 percent of their available assets, including investments, per year to pay for college, but investments in 401(k)s and IRAs are excluded. The additional financial aid application that some colleges expect, the CSS/Financial Aid Profile, also doesn't count retirement assets, although it does ask about them.</p> \n<p>But if you're still torn, a retirement vehicle called a Roth IRA allows you to have the best of both worlds: retirement savings that can still be tapped to pay college costs. Each person can contribute up to $5,500 in after-tax money to a Roth IRA. Roth IRA rules allow you to withdraw these contributions — but not any subsequent earnings — without penalty.</p> \n<p>Over 18 years, you'll be able to set aside about $100,000 — per parent — that will be available for use, tax- and penalty-free, once your kids reach college age. These funds won't count against your child in financial aid calculations, and if they're not needed for college expenses you can leave them in the Roth IRA until you reach retirement age.</p> \n<p>So if you're worried about paying for college, it might make sense to fund a personal Roth IRA before funding an employer-supplied 401(k) account. (But don't skip your 401(k) if your employer is matching contributions — <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/7/31/5882885/retirement-planning-saving-how-much-do-i-need"">see here</a> for more details.)</p> \n<h3>Save in tax-advantaged college savings accounts</h3> \n<p>Only after you've saved enough to max out both your 401(k) and IRA accounts — about $23,500 per year under current law — should you start contributing to a college-specific savings fund. The best option is generally a tax-advantaged college savings account known as a 529 plan. Contributions aren't tax-deductible, but earnings on the investments grow tax-free and are never taxed if they're used to pay educational expenses.</p> \n<p>Anyone — friends, aunts and uncles, and grandparents — can contribute to a 529 for your child. Typically, you can contribute <a href=""https://us.axa.com/goals/saving-for-college/questions/529-plans-gift-tax-exclusion.html"">up to $14,000</a> per year without incurring the federal gift tax; in some cases, you can give up to $70,000 in one year without paying the federal gift tax, because the gift is treated for tax purposes as if it were spread across five years.</p> \n<p>That tax advantage might not survive forever, particularly if there's any kind of broad tax reform in the next decade. But the <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/1/27/7925273/obama-doesnt-want-to-tax-college-savings-plans-after-all"">pushback</a> to President Obama's proposal in January to <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/1/20/7862889/college-savings-529-tax-credit"">tax 529 plans</a> suggests that they're politically popular enough to stick around.</p> \n<h3>Some colleges offer prepaid tuition plans</h3> \n<p>If you want to figure out how much to save, <a href=""http://www.savingforcollege.com/"">this calculator</a>, which assumes that college costs will continue to grow at 4 percent per year and you'll get a 6 percent rate of return on your investment, tells you how much you'd need to put away to pay for four years at a college of your choice.</p> \n<p>If that's too much uncertainty for you, it's also possible to lock in today's tuition prices through a special type of 529 account known as a prepaid tuition plan. Those plans allow families to pay tuition today to be used years down the road, after their children enroll in college.</p> \n<p>Right now, if you live in Virginia, you could buy a semester at the University of Virginia or another in-state public college for a child under 4 years old for $8,100; for a high school freshman, you could buy a semester at UVA for $7,500. Part of that expenditure would be tax-deductible.</p> \n<p>Many states have some version of this plan; there's also a <a href=""https://www.privatecollege529.com"">prepaid tuition plan available for private colleges</a>. If your child doesn't end up going to a participating state school, it's possible to get a refund and use the money elsewhere.</p> \n<h3></h3>",Business & Finance
Should you buy a house or keep renting?,http://www.vox.com/2015/8/31/9217553/buy-or-rent,"Buying a house can save some people a lot of money. But for others, renting is a smarter financial decision.","<p>There's a widespread belief that you should always own a home instead of renting, because if you rent you're ""throwing your money away,"" while buying a home means you're building up equity. There's obviously something to this — all else being the same, it's better to accumulate equity than not — but it's definitely not true that you should always buy a house as soon as possible, no matter what.</p> \n<p>When you make a mortgage payment, some of the money goes to pay off the principal of the loan, allowing you to build equity in your home. But for the first few years of the loan, a majority of your mortgage payment — nearly 70 percent at current interest rates — will be paying interest rather than principal. A good way to think about this is that you're paying ""rent"" to the bank to use some money instead of paying rent to a landlord for using an apartment.</p> \n<p>Whether renting makes financial sense depends on whether the rent is higher than the costs — interest payments, foregone interest on your down payment, property taxes, maintenance costs, homeowners insurance, and so forth — you'd have to pay as a homeowner. It also depends on whether you'll live in the house long enough for the savings to offset the substantial transaction costs involved in buying a home.</p> \n<p>Many people will come out ahead financially by buying a house rather than renting. But it depends on the market, a renter's particular circumstances, and how long the renter plans to live in the house. The New York Times has a <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/upshot/buy-rent-calculator.html"">handy calculator</a> that helps you run the numbers.</p> \n<p>Here are five key rules to follow when weighing whether to rent or buy.</p> \n<h3>Don't buy unless you expect to stay in the same place for more than four years</h3> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""4006986"" alt=""Couple with home"" src=""https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4006986/shutterstock_111393506__1_.0.jpg""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">(bikeriderlondon/Shutterstock)</p> \n<p>The length of time you'll stay in a home is by far the most important consideration in the rent-or-own calculus. The total cost of a home sale is usually between 5 and 8 percent of its value. That's approximately one year's rent for a similar property. While this cost is generally split between the buyer and the seller, you'll wind up paying both sides if you buy a house and then sell it again within a few years.</p> \n<p>What this means is that buying a house that you'll have to sell a few years later is an expensive mistake. While homeownership can provide a variety of cost savings in the long run, it will take several years for these savings to outweigh the transaction costs of buying the home in the first place.</p> \n<p><q class=""right"" aria-hidden=""true""><span>Buying a house that you'll have to sell a few years later is an expensive mistake</span></q></p> \n<p>So if there's a good chance you'll need to move to another city within a few years, it probably makes sense to rent. Similarly, if you're single but are hoping to start a family within a few years, that's something to take into account. Once you meet that special someone, you might find the place you buy isn't big enough, that it's in the wrong part of town, or that he or she already owns a nicer place.</p> \n<p>The number of years it takes to recoup the costs of buying a house depends on many individual factors. But for most people, it doesn't make sense to buy a house they'll live in for fewer than four years. And almost everyone will save money if they live in a house for more than a decade.</p> \n<h3>The richer you are, the bigger the tax breaks you get from buying</h3> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4006942/shutterstock_156648317.0.jpg"" alt=""shutterstock_156648317.0.jpg"" data-chorus-asset-id=""4006942""></p> \n<p> </p> \n<p class=""caption"">(Monkey Business Images/Shutterstock)</p> \n<p> </p> \n<p>One of the biggest advantages of buying a house is that mortgage interest payments are tax-deductible, whereas rent payments are not. The richer you are, the more significant this tax break becomes.</p> \n<p>The value of the home mortgage deduction depends not only on how much interest a taxpayer has paid, but also on the taxpayer's tax bracket. Because rich people tend to both buy bigger houses <em>and</em> be in higher tax brackets, they get a larger tax benefit <em>per dollar of housing</em>.</p> \n<p>This means the higher your tax bracket, the greater the financial benefits of home ownership. A couple making $130,000 per year and buying a $250,000 house will save about 30 percent more on its taxes, thanks to the home mortgage interest deduction, than a couple with $70,000 in income would save on the same house.</p> \n<p>Home ownership benefits wealthy Americans in another way too. Contributions to tax-sheltered retirement accounts such as 401(k)s and IRAs are currently capped at $23,500 per year for most workers. That's more than enough for most people, but wealthy workers often want to save more, and a house is one of the few productive assets a wealthy family can buy that, like a 401(k) or IRA, doesn't trigger federal income taxes. If the family bought stocks, they'd have to pay taxes on the dividends they receive. If they bought a rental property, they would have to pay taxes on the rental income. But they don't have to pay any taxes on the valuable housing services provided by their primary home. Even better, the first $500,000 of a home's price gains is protected from capital gains taxes.</p> \n<h3>Buying means you're on the hook for repairs</h3> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4006952/shutterstock_146630252.0.jpg"" alt=""shutterstock_146630252.0.jpg"" data-chorus-asset-id=""4006952""></p> \n<p> </p> \n<p class=""caption"">(Andrey_Popov/Shutterstock)</p> \n<p> </p> \n<p>When you rent, you're not just paying for housing, you're also paying for the landlord to make routine repairs and bear the financial risks involved in property ownership. Once you become a homeowner, those hassles and risks fall on your shoulders. When something in the house breaks, you have to either fix it yourself or hire a handyman to do it for you. And if a major appliance like the furnace breaks, you could suddenly find yourself on the hook for major repairs.</p> \n<h3>Renting limits how much you can deck out your place</h3> \n<p>The flip side of this is that homeowners have a lot more freedom to customize a home to their liking. If you own your home, you can add a bathroom, remodel the kitchen, or build a back deck.</p> \n<p>These kinds of expensive upgrades don't make sense in a rental property. The landlord won't want to pay for them because the next tenant may not be willing to pay extra for them. And tenants won't want to pay for improvements they'll only get to enjoy for a few years. So many renters wind up living in homes they don't love and can't improve. If you're one of them, that's an argument for buying.</p> \n<h3>Buying a home is betting that your job is secure and your city will keep doing well</h3> \n<p>One possible downside to owning a home — especially early in your career — is that it limits your economic mobility. Suppose you had gotten a job in the Detroit automobile industry in the early 2000s. If you'd bought a home, you could have wound up in a terrible situation in 2009: Not only could you lose your job, but you could get stuck with a mortgage that was worth more than your home, making it difficult to move to another metropolitan area to get a job.</p> \n<p>Some economists see this as a big downside to owning a home. It's good investment practice to diversify: to spread your economic risk around so that one calamity won't wipe you out financially. Buying a home in the same metropolitan area where you work is the opposite of diversification.</p> \n<p><q class=""center"" aria-hidden=""true""><span>Renters face the risk that surging housing demand will cause rents to rise faster than their incomes</span></q></p> \n<p>However, this argument has limits. For one thing, not all jobs are alike. For example, many government workers enjoy robust civil service protections and don't need to worry that an economic downturn will lead to layoffs. Health-care professionals are less vulnerable to layoffs than most other private sector workers. If you have a secure job and you expect to keep it for many years, then there's little reason to worry about getting underwater with your mortgage — you'll be able to continue living in your home and paying the mortgage regardless of how much it's worth.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, renters face the risk that surging housing demand will cause rents to rise faster than their incomes. If you have a stable job but little prospect for getting raises — or you're retired and on a fixed income — then rising rents could actually be a bigger financial worry than the local economy imploding. Buying a house allows you to hedge against future changes in the housing market, ensuring that you'll be able to afford housing no matter how expensive the rental market gets.</p>",Business & Finance
This map shows how house prices have evolved in America's biggest cities,http://www.vox.com/2015/8/29/9220869/house-price-map,Florida versus Texas is particularly interesting.,"<p>Everyone knows that house prices rose in the aughts and then crashed in the lead-up to the Great Recession. But housing is also a quintessentially <em>local</em> market — you can't just swap a home in San Francisco for one in Detroit.</p> \n<p>This great animated map of home values in different areas from HowMuch.net illustrates both how prices changed over time and how they vary from place to place:</p> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""4008938""><img src=""https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4008938/HomeVal_USCity2_900px-3acd.gif""></div> \n<p>One thing that really jumps out here is the explosion of the Florida real estate market during the early mid-aughts. The United States has a longstanding divide between more expensive metro areas in the Northeast and Pacific Coast and cheaper ones in the heartland. But Tampa and Miami spend the '90s looking cheap and then suddenly turn very pricey before collapsing.</p> \n<p>The flip side of that is that Texas's housing markets were largely insulated from the bubble trend. The Dallas area had an unrelated price explosion in the '80s related to the oil industry, but in the aughts Texans build a lot of new houses and had regulations limiting how much debt they could take on, so things stayed relatively under control there.</p>",Business & Finance
Should the Fed binge on M&Ms in September so it can go on a diet next year?,http://www.vox.com/2015/8/28/9221657/fed-september-meeting-rate-hike,Raising interests rates to slow the economy now in order to cut them again later makes no sense.,"<p>When the economy enters a recession, the Federal Reserve normally responds by reducing interest rates to try to stimulate demand for business equipment, houses, cars, and durable goods. When I wrote that <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/8/27/9215629/september-fed-interest-rates"">the Fed shouldn't raise rates this fall</a> given how benign the inflation rate remains, many people emailed me arguing that the Fed should raise interest rates sooner rather than later because right now rates are at zero, so they can't really be cut. A hike in September or October would give the Fed more ammunition for the next recession.</p> \n<p>This is a doubly misguided view. First, it's not true that there's nothing the Fed can do to stimulate the economy with interest rates at zero. Second, even if it <em>were</em> true that the Fed has no other tools, the proposed rate hike wouldn't solve the problem.</p> \n<h3>Returning to the status quo is no better than sticking with it</h3> \n<p><span>It is true that if the Fed raises interest rates this fall, then it has the option of lowering them in the spring if the economy looks weaker. But it is also true that if the Fed </span><em>doesn't</em><span> raise interest rates this fall, then it still has the option of deploying zero interest rates in the spring.</span></p> \n<p>The hike-now-to-cut-later proposition is a bit like saying that I should gorge myself on M&amp;Ms this afternoon so that I can lose weight next week by cutting down on snacks. This kind of thing might work as a psychological trick — I smoked more than ever in the three months before I quit smoking — but it doesn't accomplish anything biologically or economically.</p> \n<h3>The Fed can do more stuff</h3> \n<p>Moreover, it's simply not true that there are no stimulative monetary policy measures the Federal Reserve can take when short-term interest rates are already zero.</p> \n<p>Policy options include:</p> \n<ul> \n<li>Printing money to buy longer-term government bonds (quantitative easing)</li> \n<li>Printing money to buy <em>foreign</em> government bonds (currency devaluation)</li> \n<li>Abandoning inflation <em>rate</em> targeting in favor of <em>price level</em> (or nominal income) targeting</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Last but by no means least, even though academic economists thought for a long time that it would be impossible to have interest rates that go below zero, <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/2/5/7981461/negative-interest-rates-europe"">this turns out to be empirically false</a>. Academics had thought that because paper money pays a zero percent interest rate (i.e., it's a piece of paper), electronic bank deposits could never pay a lower rate than that, since people would just hold cash instead.</p> \n<h3>Why the ""zero bound"" turns out to be a myth</h3> \n<p>But it turns out that storing gigantic piles of cash in a safe way is expensive and inconvenient, and using giant piles of cash as a payment medium is even more expensive and inconvenient.</p> \n<p>You may have heard, for example, that Apple has a $178 billion cash stockpile. This is obviously not an <em>actual pile of physical cash</em>. If he really wanted to, Tim Cook could presumably order the construction of a massive warehouse full of money located in an offshore tax haven. He could hire armed guards to watch over the complex. He could commission a fleet of ships to carry cash around the world to pay Apple's suppliers and collect its revenue. But this would be <em>very</em> expensive. And for all the same reasons that it would be annoying for Apple to conduct business in this manner, Apple's key suppliers and subcontractors would be pretty annoyed if Apple tried to pay them in the form of trucks full of paper money.</p> \n<p>Academics are not practically minded people, so this was not really in their minds when they formed the conventional wisdom about the impossibility of negative interest rates. But over the <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/2/5/7981461/negative-interest-rates-europe"">winter of 2014-'15, plenty of European countries experienced negative interest rates</a>, so we know they are possible.</p> \n<p>""Higher rates today to cut rates tomorrow"" turns out to be a bad solution to a problem that doesn't even exist.</p>",Business & Finance
China's economic slowdown: 11 things you should know,http://www.vox.com/2015/9/3/9251775/chinas-economic-slowdown,It's not just the stock market. The world's number two economy has run into serious trouble.,"<p>China is the world's second-largest economy, after the United States, and it's been growing so rapidly for so long that rapid Chinese economic growth has become part of the landscape for an entire generation.</p> \n<p>Yet in recent years, people have been warning that the model underlying that rapid growth is unsustainable. And it now looks like the summer of 2015 is the time at which the unsustainable trend finally came to an end.</p> \n<h3>1) China's economy is in a lot of trouble</h3> \n<p><a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/8/25/9205813/china-stock-market-crash-news"">China has been experiencing a stock market crash</a> all summer, but since that crash was preceded by a ridiculous months-long stock market boom it wasn't initially obvious that this had enormous implications for the real Chinese economy.</p> \n<p>More recently, however, it has become clear that there are serious issues in terms of China's real output of goods. You can see this in a <a href=""http://www.rttnews.com/2539067/singapore-gdp-revised-up-to-1-8-on-year-in-q2.aspx"">sharp contraction in shipping through Singapore</a>, a <a href=""https://next.ft.com/fe1df514-4b43-11e5-b558-8a9722977189#axzz3jftu69dI"">general decline in the volume of world trade</a>, and the <a href=""http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-09-02/dollar-falls-below-70-us-cents-on-back-of-weak-gdp-figures/6743298"">falling price of the Australian dollar</a>, all of which are ripple effects of China importing fewer raw materials and seemingly exporting fewer finished goods.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, China has been <a href=""http://www.wsj.com/articles/chinas-central-bank-cuts-interest-rates-1440499276"">furiously cutting interest rates</a> in an effort to stimulate its economy. So far, however, that hasn't seemed to have generated much growth. (It's not yet clear if this monetary stimulus is at least generating inflation, which would have implications for the possible effectiveness of further rate cuts down the road.)</p> \n<h3>2) Chinese economic data is low-quality</h3> \n<p>One very serious issue in writing about the Chinese economy is that to understand what's going on you often need to make inferences based on data out of Singapore, Hong Kong, Australia, or other places that enjoy strong economic links to China. The problem is that China's authoritarian political system makes it very difficult to regard any of its economic data as reliable.</p> \n<p>Back in 2007, Li Keqiang — now the number two figure in the Chinese government — observed that Chinese economic statistics are <a href=""http://www.reuters.com/article/2010/12/06/us-china-economy-wikileaks-idUSTRE6B527D20101206"">""man-made""</a> and therefore unreliable. Some progress has been made since then in improving their rigor. But these statistics are not just man-made, they are the product of a closed and opaque political system with no press freedom, so it would be very difficult for abuses and problems with the data to come to light. What's more, since the Chinese government clearly engages in censorship and information control to maintain its authority, there is no reason to believe it would be forthright about releasing bad economic news.</p> \n<p>Even market-based Chinese data like stock prices is unreliable because <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/7/11/8933341/china-is-destroying-its-stock-market-in-order-to-save-it"">the government has taken to intervening forcefully</a> to manipulate share prices.  You can infer broad trends from the more reliable foreign data, but to have a finer-grained sense of what's going on you would really need accurate Chinese data, and it simply doesn't exist.</p> \n<h3>3) Chinese growth was based on unsustainable levels of investment</h3> \n<p>For the past five or six years, Chinese economic growth has been powered by a mind-boggling level of investment spending — both public and private sector.</p> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""4022730""><img src=""https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4022730/ff395_5.png""></div> \n<p>Investments are things that produce an ongoing flow of services in the future. That means everything from new highways and subway tunnels to new apartment blocks and factories. And, to be clear, investment is good! All else being equal, a nation that spends a large share of its income on investment goods is better positioned for long-term growth than a nation that spends a large share of its income on short-lived consumption goods.</p> \n<p>But in practice, there's only so much <em>useful</em> investment than can be made in any given span of time. In a very poor country, there should be tons of opportunities for investments with high payoff. But over time, you expect diminishing returns to set in and the level of investment to fall. In China, however, investment had been accelerating even as the country got richer — a trend that pretty clearly needed to reverse.</p> \n<h3>4) China needs to switch to ""consumption-led"" growth</h3> \n<p>It's also been clear for some time now that to put itself on a sustainable basis, China needs to shift to a more conventional consumption-based growth model. In other words, it needs a smaller share of its population employed in things like building roads and factories and a larger share of its population employed in things like driving cabs and selling cars.</p> \n<p>This is not a particularly controversial idea, in theory. Indeed, <a href=""http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/03/05/us-china-parliament-idUSBRE92402R20130305"">it's been the official policy of the Chinese government for years now</a>. The problem is that the practical implications of actually <em>doing</em> it are tricky.</p> \n<h3>5) Even if China's reforms work, growth will slow</h3> \n<p>In a very short-term sense, you can always swap out a dollar of investment for an extra dollar of consumption. But because useful investments lay the groundwork for future production, this switch has implications for medium-term growth. <a href=""http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2015/09/a-simple-primer-for-understanding-chinas-downturn.html"">As economist Tyler Cowen writes</a>, ""There is no simple way to switch to a 'consumption-driven' economy without the growth rate both falling and staying permanently lower.""</p> \n<p>As long as there are useful investments to make, then growth fuels more growth. You build a mine to dig for coal, then you build a power plant to burn the coal, then you build a cement plant to use the electricity, then you build a factory to manufacture more mining equipment, and so forth. Once you start running out of investments, however, this accelerator process is going to collapse, and the sustainable rate of growth will slow dramatically — even if you pull off the switch to consumption.</p> \n<h3>6) Inequality and a weak welfare state hurt Chinese consumption</h3> \n<p>China is a nominally socialist society run by a self-proclaimed Communist Party, but it actually features <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/8/31/9228723/china-safety-net-inequality"">sky-high inequality and a weak welfare state</a>.</p> \n<p>Rich people spend a lower share of their income than poor people, and working-age people spend a lower share of their income than retirees. Consequently, a more robust social welfare state that did more to transfer economic resources from the wealthy to the poor and the retired would help bolster consumption and put the Chinese economy on more sustainable footing.</p> \n<h3>7) A sharp growth slowdown would be historically typical</h3> \n<p>China's economic success story over the past 30 years has been incredibly impressive, and due to the country's vast size it's been incredibly important. But such success is far from unprecedented. A number of other countries have gone through the basic cycle of very rapid export-led industrialization — often leading internal and external observers to believe that the rapid pace of growth can be sustained indefinitely.</p> \n<p>In their paper <a href=""http://larrysummers.com/2015/03/03/asiaphoria-meets-regression-to-the-mean-2/"">""Asiaphoria Meets Regression to the Mean,""</a> Lawrence Summers and Lant Pritchett show that this has not been the case for earlier growth miracle countries. It's not just that growth slows down from its peak blistering pace (which essentially everyone concedes). They find that growth slows <em>all the way down</em> to a global average level, with no persistence whatsoever of past excellent performance.</p> \n<h3>8) The big question: Will China undergo a slowdown or a recession?</h3> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""4023902""><img src=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4023902/Screen%20Shot%202015-09-02%20at%201.28.20%20PM.png""></div> \n<p>A recession, in conventional terms, is when an economy actually <em>shrinks</em> — something that hasn't happened for decades in China. But in countries like the United States, the baseline level of ""normal"" growth is pretty low — 2 or 3 percent per year — so it only takes a relatively modest decline in the growth rate to push you into negative territory.</p> \n<p>China is different. Like most countries around the world, it had a bad year in 2009. But in Chinese terms, ""a bad year"" still meant a growth rate of more than 6 percent followed by a snapback to almost 12 percent. Growth has slowed considerably since then, and by all signs things are much worse in 2015. But one crucial question is whether China is simply going to slow down a lot — to something like 2 or 3 or 4 percent — or whether there's actually going to be a recession.</p> \n<h3>9) High levels of debt could make the slowdown worse</h3> \n<p>One potential problem is that in recent years, Chinese businesses and households have taken on a lot of debt.</p> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""4023768""><img src=""https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4023768/Blackrock-China-debt-1.jpg""></div> \n<p>Going into debt isn't always a bad idea. In fact, given the very fast growth rate of the Chinese economy between 1995 and 2015, most Chinese companies probably would have been better off borrowing <em>more</em> money in the 1990s.</p> \n<p>But if you borrow money expecting an average 7 percent annual growth rate and only get an average 2 percent annual growth rate, then you could wind up in a world of trouble. Potentially, even, in a spiral of bankruptcies and financial crisis that lead to a recession.</p> \n<h3>10) Chinese politics hamper an effective response</h3> \n<p>The combination of rapid 21st-century economic growth in China, political crises in the United States, and China's authoritarian political system sometimes leads Western commentators to dream hazily about the virtues of Chinese authoritarianism in cutting through the nonsense and letting leaders do what needs to be done.</p> \n<p>The reality, however, is that <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/7/9/8922727/china-economy-stock-market-problem"">authoritarian political systems still have politics</a>. There are still interest groups, and public officials are still sometimes more loyal to particular interests than to the good of the nation. This is a crucial issue in China's rebalancing process. It's easy for an outsider observer to say that inefficient state-owned enterprises should be shut down. It's harder for a government official who needs to worry about lost jobs. It's easy for an outsider to say that China needs more income redistribution. It's harder to defeat the political power of rich Chinese people who would rather the country not do that. It's easy to say China needs to spend less on construction projects and more on social services. But to do that you need to overcome the entrenched interests of the contractors who benefit from the projects.</p> \n<p>China's leaders give every indication of being broadly aware of the nature of the country's problems and the kinds of solutions that are needed. What's less clear is that they can actually deliver these solutions.</p> \n<h3>11) This summer has shaken faith in China's leaders</h3> \n<p>Much of this has been in the air for years. The reason it's coming to a head now is that the stock market bubble and subsequent collapse have shaken faith in the Chinese government's ability to form and execute coherent policy.</p> \n<p>When the bubble was on its way up, the government tried — and failed — to slow it. Then when it started to pop, the government tried — and, again, failed — to slow the pace of the collapse. <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/8/13/9149953/chinese-currency-devaluation-explained"">China devalued its currency</a> to boost its economy, but didn't go far enough. It's cut interest rates repeatedly, only to find that it needs to cut them again. Now the government seems to be arresting people who <a href=""http://money.cnn.com/2015/08/31/investing/china-arrests-markets-crash/"">express negative opinions about the stock market outlet</a>.</p> \n<p>This summer's events have laid bare the reality beneath the incredible successes of the past 20 years. China remains a middle-income country with shaky economic institutions and an opaque and unaccountable political system. Three decades of stellar growth starting from a rock-bottom floor have landed China at a level of per capita prosperity that's similar to Serbia or Peru or the Dominican Republic — places that nobody regards as obviously amazing investment opportunities even though in some ways their political systems are more solid than China's.</p> \n<p>Loss of faith has a self-fulfilling aspect to it. To the extent that people believe China can conquer its present-day challenges, actually conquering them becomes easier. To the extent that people begin to write China off, then it will have greater difficulties in pulling off the kind of transition the country needs.</p>",Business & Finance

It's time to kill the myth that millennials don't buy things,http://www.vox.com/personal-finance/2015/9/4/9261135/bls-consumer-spending-survey-2014,"The average 30-year-old American spends less total cash than a 44-year-old, but a larger portion of their total income.","<p>We've been told that <a href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/millennials-are-renting-instead-of-buying-2015-5"">millennials don't care about owning things</a>, so it makes sense to think that they might spend less. The latest <a href=""http://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/cesan.pdf"">Consumer Expenditure Survey</a>, which records how Americans spend their income, casts doubt on that assumption. Not only are typical millennials buying a lot, but they're spending their income at a higher average rate than adults between 35 and 44 years of age.</p> \n<h3>Eat, pray, love, and spend money</h3> \n<p>Let's take a look first at the survey's next-older cohort, adults between 35 and 44 years of age. In 2014, they reported an average pre-tax income of $84,094 in 2014. (Since the survey is national, it makes taxes impossible to parse, but it's good to keep in mind that these are all averages.) This older group spent an average of $62,512 per year, which is about 74 percent of their pre-tax income.</p> \n<p>Next, let's compare that with younger adults between 25 and 34 years of age. This younger group's income averaged $61,042 a year. They spent about $49,546 that same year, or 81 percent of their income. So this group reported spending 7 percent more of total income than the older group, even though they reported an average of $21,000 less income before taxes.</p> \n<p>It's really easy to miss the fact that younger adults are spending a larger portion of their income by only reviewing dollar amounts on individual items. Here are some individual examples that might suggest millennials spend less of their income simply because they make less. For example, millennials spend the most on the big three costs everyone has: shelter, transportation, and food. But they spent less on the big three, on average, than the older cohort:</p> \n<table class=""viz-table"" style=""width: 627.777770996094px; font-size: 16px; margin-bottom: 2em;""> \n<thead>  \n<tr> \n<td style=""border: 2px solid #dddddd; width: 208.888900756836px; padding: 3px 8px 1px; font-weight: bold; background-color: #dddddd;"">Age range</td> \n<td style=""border: 2px solid #dddddd; width: 208.888900756836px; padding: 3px 8px 1px; font-weight: bold; text-align: center; background-color: #dddddd;"">25-34</td> \n<td style=""border: 2px solid #dddddd; width: 208.888900756836px; padding: 3px 8px 1px; font-weight: bold; text-align: center; background-color: #dddddd;"">35-44</td> \n</tr> \n</thead>  \n<tbody> \n<tr> \n<td style=""border: 2px solid #e0dedf; width: 208.888900756836px; padding: 3px 8px 1px;"">Housing</td> \n<td style=""border: 2px solid #e0dedf; width: 208.888900756836px; padding: 3px 8px 1px; text-align: center;""><span>$17,403</span></td> \n<td style=""border: 2px solid #e0dedf; width: 208.888900756836px; padding: 3px 8px 1px; text-align: center;""><span>$21,222</span></td> \n</tr> \n<tr> \n<td style=""border: 2px solid #e0dedf; width: 208.888900756836px; padding: 3px 8px 1px;"">Transportation</td> \n<td style=""border: 2px solid #e0dedf; width: 208.888900756836px; padding: 3px 8px 1px; text-align: center;""><span>$8,907</span></td> \n<td style=""border: 2px solid #e0dedf; width: 208.888900756836px; padding: 3px 8px 1px; text-align: center;""><span>$10,617</span></td> \n</tr> \n<tr> \n<td style=""border: 2px solid #e0dedf; width: 208.888900756836px; padding: 3px 8px 1px;"">Food at home</td> \n<td style=""border: 2px solid #e0dedf; width: 208.888900756836px; padding: 3px 8px 1px; text-align: center;""><span>$3,711</span></td> \n<td style=""border: 2px solid #e0dedf; width: 208.888900756836px; padding: 3px 8px 1px; text-align: center;"">\n<span>$4,675</span><br>\n</td> \n</tr> \n<tr> \n<td style=""border: 2px solid #e0dedf; width: 208.888900756836px; padding: 3px 8px 1px;"">Food away from home</td> \n<td style=""border: 2px solid #e0dedf; width: 208.888900756836px; padding: 3px 8px 1px; text-align: center;""><span>$2,920</span></td> \n<td style=""border: 2px solid #e0dedf; width: 208.888900756836px; padding: 3px 8px 1px; text-align: center;""><span>$3,387</span></td> \n</tr> \n</tbody> \n</table> \n<p>A rough analysis of the thousands of survey items recorded suggests that at least 60 percent of the time, younger adults reported spending less on individual items.

United created a special route for a Chris Christie appointee. Now its CEO has resigned.,http://www.vox.com/2015/9/8/9282591/united-ceo-resignation-explained,The airline is facing an investigation into possibly improper dealings with the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.,"<ul> \n<li>The CEO of United Airlines, Jeffery Smisek, has stepped down in the midst of a federal investigation into United's dealings with the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.</li> \n<li>According to a <a href=""http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-04-28/the-dinner-proposal-that-led-united-into-corruption-probe"">Bloomberg story</a> published in April, Port Authority chair David Samson asked United to establish a direct flight from Newark to Columbia, South Carolina, which was near Samson's weekend home.</li> \n<li>United eventually complied with the request, according to Bloomberg, after ""Samson twice threatened to block Port Authority consideration of one or more of the airline’s favored projects.""</li> \n<li>The ongoing scandal could prove embarrassing for New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie — who appointed Samson to the Port Authority — though there's no evidence of wrongdoing by Christie himself.</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>United has been lobbying for years to lower fees at Newark Airport</h3> \n<p>The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey is a sprawling government bureaucracy that controls a number of transportation facilities in the New York Metropolitan area, including Newark Liberty Airport. Newark was historically a hub for Continental Airlines, which merged with United in 2010.</p> \n<p>United has long contended that the Port Authority charges excessive fees for the use of Newark airport, relative to fees at other airports in the New York metropolitan area.  With United accounting for 70 percent of the airport's traffic, the airline argued that the fees put it at a competitive disadvantage.</p> \n<p>So United has been lobbying Samson to lower the fees ever since he became chair of the Port Authority in 2011. Samson dined with Smisek in September 2011, and according to Bloomberg, he asked Smisek to reinstate a previously-cancelled route from Newark to Columbia, South Carolina, which was close to a vacation home Samson owned.</p> \n<p>United initially refused, but relented after Samson allegedly threatened to delay projects favored by United. <a href=""http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-04-28/the-dinner-proposal-that-led-united-into-corruption-probe"">Bloomberg says</a> it has reviewed documents that ""indicate there may have been a direct link between the request for the Columbia flight and the Port Authority’s process of approving projects involving the airport.""</p> \n<p>The route had one round-trip flight twice a week: It <a href=""http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2015-04-16/christie-ally-samson-s-loyalty-may-be-tested-as-probe-winds-down"">flew from Newark to Columbia</a> on Thursday evenings and returned on Monday morning — perfect for a government official who liked to spend weekends in South Carolina. Records obtained by Bloomberg indicate that it was about half full on a typical flight during its two-year run.</p> \n<h3>Samson had close Christie ties</h3> \n<p>The federal investigation into Samson's dealings with United are a spinoff of a federal investigation into <a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/chris-christie-scandals-explained/what-is-bridgegate-fort-lee-traffic-scandal"">""Bridgegate,""</a> a scandal in which Christie aides allegedly conspired to close lanes on the George Washington bridge from New Jersey to New York City in order to retaliate against a perceived political enemy.</p> \n<p>Samson, an attorney, advised the Christie gubernatorial campaign and was then named as the chair of Christie's transition committee in 2009. The next year, Christie appointed Samson to the Port Authority board.</p> \n<p>During Christie and Samson's tenure, United gave heavily to Christie's gubernatorial campaign, and to other organizations connected to Christie. United executives <a href=""http://www.wnyc.org/story/christies-other-port-authority-problem/"">donated $24,000</a> to Christie's reelection campaign in 2013, and United also ""gave $100,000 to Choose New Jersey, a business group that answers ultimately to Christie,"" according to WNYC, and another $10,000 to the Republican Governor's Association while Christie was the chairman.</p> \n<p>All these donations were part of a campaign to enlist Christie's support to lower the Newark airport fees. The parties came close to reaching a deal in late 2013 that would have cut the fees. But then news of Bridgegate broke, disrupting the Port Authority's operations and preventing an agreement.</p> \n<p>Samson resigned in March 2014, in the midst of the Bridgegate scandal. <span>Three days later, United canceled the Newark-to-Columbia route.</span></p> \n<p>Now, with federal investigators probing United's dealings with the Port Authority, <span>Smisek has resigned as CEO of United. He'll be replaced by rail industry executive Oscar Munoz.</span></p> \n<hr> \n<p><b>Correction:</b> I originally said the flight to Columbia ran once a week, but it actually ran twice a week, according to Bloomberg.</p>",Business & Finance
"The web browser saved Apple, but Apple is over the web browser",http://www.vox.com/2015/9/10/9298849/appletv-apps-browser,"The internet of apps is great for Apple, but bad for competition.","<p>When the original iPhone shipped in 2007, there was no app store, and you couldn't install any third-party apps on the phone. But it didn't matter, because the phone shipped with a stock app that was really the only app that mattered — the Safari web browser.</p> \n<p>It's easy to forget these days what a miracle mobile Safari was. But while the iPhone was neither the first nor the fastest smartphone available at the time, it certainly <em>was</em> the first smartphone to give you a high-quality web browsing experience. And that was crucial, because in the mid-aughts the web was the great equalizer. By having a fully featured web browser, the iPhone transcended the concept of phones and became a true pocket computer — a juggernaut.</p> \n<p>On Wednesday September 9, Apple announced a new, <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/9/9/9295683/apple-tv"">massively upgraded Apple TV</a> and the next iteration of its Watch OS.</p> \n<p>Neither includes a web browser.</p> \n<h3>The internet of apps</h3> \n<p>The lack of a browser on the Apple Watch and Apple TV isn't exactly shocking — neither the wrist nor the television screen provides an ideal browsing environment — but the failure to include them is a bit remarkable nonetheless.</p> \n<p>After all, my Apple Watch features a watch-optimized version of Apple's photo browsing software, even though a tiny screen on your wrist isn't an ideal photo browsing environment. Apple engineers put it on there because they could, and because photos are integral to the overall Apple ecosystem. Technologically speaking, including a web browser on either device — but especially the television — would be trivial. A browser isn't on there because Apple didn't bother, and Apple didn't bother because it no longer sees web browsing as central to its ecosystem.</p> \n<p>In the desktop era, the World Wide Web was so central to the experience of the internet that for years the most popular web browser was literally called Internet Explorer. The internet was the web, and the thing you used to browse the web was the way you explored the internet.</p> \n<p>The mobile world is very different.</p> \n<p>With less screen space, processor power, and bandwidth available, the web browsing experience is less compelling. The web's point-and-click navigation structure reeks of desktop-first design. And the challenge of monetizing mobile web views has driven major publishers to load their (okay, our) sites with ad technology that further reduces load times and increases reading hassles.</p> \n<p>The mobile internet is primarily an internet of apps — my go-tos are Twitter, Instagram, and Messages, but obviously Facebook is dominant, and Pinterest, Snapchat, and a bevy of messaging apps are all coming on strong. On my Mac, I navigate to Amazon.com to buy things, but on my iPhone I fire up the Amazon app for a faster, more native experience. This is the Way We Internet Now, and on both the watch and the set-top box, Apple thinks the web is a ladder we can kick away in favor of native apps with UI that is optimized to the particular device. And it's probably right.</p> \n<h3>The death of the web is bad for competition</h3> \n<p>Of course, one reason this makes sense for Apple is that as the world's largest company, and as the owner of a smartphone juggernaut, the company can get people to invest the time and energy into building native apps.</p> \n<p>Apple is big enough that a nontrivial number of companies found it worth their while to make apps even when the products had few users — or no users at all. And there is a virtuous circle in this. The guaranteed presence of third-party apps on day one will help sell Apple TVs, and the size of the Apple TV customer base will help drive the development of further apps.</p> \n<p>A new entrant would have trouble pulling off that sort of thing.</p> \n<p>Ironically, this is exactly why the web was so important to Apple early in the 21st century. For years, the company was stuck on the losing end of that circle. Most people wanted to use Windows PCs because they had all the software, and most people wanted to develop for Windows because it had all the users.</p> \n<p>In that world, the web was a game changer for Mac users.</p> \n<p>When <em>browsing web</em><em>s</em><em>ites</em> became the most important, most exciting thing to do with your computer, suddenly the Mac and the PC were put on a level playing field. Even better, when Apple rolled out the iPhone it didn't need to get third parties to take speculative bets on the platform's success. The ""phone"" could browse the web! By building the best pocketable web browser on the planet, Apple rocketed ahead of longtime handset incumbents in a way that was only possible because all the best stuff to do was just a few clicks away.</p> \n<p>Of course, for Apple, the fact that the post-web internet makes it harder for the next Apple to arrive is only icing on the cake. And certainly Apple is under no obligation to remain a browser enthusiast just because the Web 2.0 era of browser-mania was very good for the company. Indeed, even if it <em>did</em> include token web browsers on its new products, it seems likely that nobody would use them. The technology fundamentals are dictating both user behavior and business strategy, not vice versa.</p> \n<p>But as users and consumers, we should make no mistake — after a brief, entrant-friendly, web-first world, the technology universe is increasingly moving into an incumbent-friendly, app-first world.</p>",Business & Finance

As both writers note, there's been rapid growth in the number of ""unicorns"": privately held technology companies whose value, at least on paper, exceeds a billion dollars.</p> \n<p>But while there are some superficial similarities between today's technology boom and the bubble of the late 1990s, there's also a huge difference. The internet not only has 10 times as many users as it had 16 years ago, it's also much more central to users' lives and — therefore — the economy. In 1999, big, profitable internet companies were mostly a theoretical concept. Today, companies like Facebook and Google have proven that it's possible to make huge profits online.</p> \n<p>So to figure out whether there's a bubble, you shouldn't look at whether Silicon Valley parties have gotten more extravagant. Instead, you want to do some basic math: Has the value of technology startups grown out of proportion to their future earnings potential? This isn't easy to calculate, because we don't know how much today's technology startups will make in the future, and it's certainly possible that some unicorn investors will lose money.</p> \n<p>But publicly traded company valuations have risen <em>slower</em> than profits. And if some of the startup prices you see bandied around in the media sound too high to you, that's partly because of the somewhat misleading way these valuations are reported.</p> \n<h3>The values of big tech companies have grown more slowly than their earnings</h3> \n<p>There's no question that the value of technology companies has soared over the last few years. But by itself, that doesn't prove that there's a bubble. When you buy stock in a company, what you're ultimately buying is a share of its future profits. A bubble is when company values soar <em>without</em> a corresponding rise in their earning potential.</p> \n<p>So a good indicator for whether there's a bubble is to compare a company's stock price with its profits. If this ratio (known as the ""P/E ratio"") goes up, that can be a telltale sign of a bubble. Andreessen Horowitz, a venture capital firm that has emerged as a leading anti-bubble voice, compiled a chart showing how the P/E ratio of publicly traded information technology companies that are part of the S&amp;P 500 (which includes 500 of the largest companies in America) has changed over time:</p> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""3981802""><img src=""https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3981802/no_tech_bubble.png""></div> \n<p>The gray line shows that the stock price of big IT firms has risen significantly over the past five years. However, when you divide companies' stock price by their projected earnings — the orange line — it reveals that today's stock market boom is different from the boom of the 1990s. The 1990s saw tech stocks soaring much faster than tech company profits. In the current boom, by contrast, rising stock prices simply reflect rising profitability in the technology sector.</p> \n<h3>Valuing startups is hard</h3> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4052096/GettyImages-456877564.0.jpg"" alt=""GettyImages-456877564.0.jpg"" data-chorus-asset-id=""4052096""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Snapchat CEO Evan Spiegel has yet to earn a single dollar in profit, yet his company is worth $16 billion — at least on paper. (Michael Kovac/Getty Images for Vanity Fair)</p> \n<p>If we could make a chart like this to cover the technology industry as a whole, we could settle the bubble debate once and for all. Unfortunately, there are several reasons we can't do this.</p> \n<p>One is that this data isn't available for a lot of important technology companies. Microsoft, Google, and Facebook offer their shares to the general public, so the Securities and Exchange Commission requires them to release data on their profits. But many technology companies, including Uber, Airbnb, and hundreds of smaller startups, are privately held. We don't know how much profit they've made — if any — so we can't compute P/E ratios for them.</p> \n<p>But even if we did have complete earnings data for privately held companies, we'd still run up against a deeper problem: The values of companies are about investors' projections of <em>future</em> profits. For a big company like Apple or Google, past profits provide a pretty good way to estimate future profits. But a startup like Snapchat (much like Facebook and Google in their early years) has yet to earn a single dollar in profit. That makes a P/E ratio a totally useless way to gauge its value. There are tons of technology startups — including some with values over a billion dollars — in the same boat.</p> \n<h3>Private company values are weird</h3> \n<p> </p> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4052118/GettyImages-458117508.0.jpg"" alt=""GettyImages-458117508.0.jpg"" data-chorus-asset-id=""4052118""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Uber CEO Travis Kalanick. (Barry Chin/The Boston Globe via Getty Images)</p> \n<p>A final complication to valuing privately held companies is that a company that's worth $1 billion on paper may not actually be worth a billion dollars.</p> \n<p>Anyone who owns a share of Apple or Microsoft can sell it and get the current market price. And usually all shares in a publicly traded company have equal value. So to figure out how much a publicly traded company is worth, we can just multiply the share price by the number of outstanding shares. Right now, for example, Apple is worth $644 billion.</p> \n<p>Private companies are different. When a company raises funding from a venture capital firm, the deal is usually structured so that the new investors get their money back before anyone else can cash out. This makes good business sense, because it ensures the founders won't get rich unless the investors at least get their money back.</p> \n<p>But it also has a tendency to inflate the paper value of privately held firms. Back in July, Uber <a href=""http://www.wsj.com/articles/uber-valued-at-more-than-50-billion-1438367457"">sold around 2 percent of the company</a> for around $1 billion, giving the company a theoretical value of $50 billion. But if the new investors' shares are given a privileged position (as they usually are in this kind of investment), then they aren't taking as big of a risk as it might appear on paper.  If Uber winds up being worth less than $50 billion, the paper losses will fall more heavily on the founders and earlier investors.</p> \n<p>What this means in practice is that a private company being ""valued at"" $50 billion isn't comparable to a public company with a $50 billion market capitalization. If you think Uber's probably not worth $50 billion, you're in good company. Even the people who invested in Uber at a $50 billion valuation probably don't think Uber is worth $50 billion right now. They <em>do</em> believe that if all goes well, Uber could be worth more than $50 billion in a few years. But they may also have structured the deal so that if Uber underperforms expectations (but doesn't go completely bankrupt), they'll still get most of their money back.</p> \n<p>And that, in turn, means that the market hasn't gone as crazy as the number of ""unicorns"" might make it seem. There are more than 100 companies that are worth more than $1 billion on paper, including Uber, Airbnb, Dropbox, Pinterest, Spotify, Square, Stripe, Zenefits, Lyft, Slack, and many you've never heard of. But it's widely understood and accepted that not all of these companies will ultimately achieve values above $1 billion. (Snapchat is a rare exception to this rule — the investors in its latest $16 billion funding round reportedly <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-05-29/snapchat-said-to-be-valued-at-16-billion-in-new-fundraising"">did not get a preferential position</a> relative to the company's founders.)</p> \n<h3>The current batch of ""unicorns"" has a lot of potential</h3> \n<p>There are also good reasons to think that the current crop of unicorns could earn a lot of money for their investors:</p> \n<ul> \n<li>Skeptics have scoffed at Snapchat, which is rumored to be <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-05-29/snapchat-said-to-be-valued-at-16-billion-in-new-fundraising"">worth around $16 billion</a> despite the fact that it has yet to turn a profit and didn't even generate much revenue in 2014. But Snapchat has <a href=""http://qz.com/412201/snapchat-says-its-100-million-users-are-watching-2-billion-mobile-videos-a-day/"">100 million daily users</a>, and history suggests that you can generate a lot of ad revenue with a user base that large. Snapchat hasn't made much money so far because it focused on growing users first and only recently started its ad program. But there's every reason to think that once this program is firing on all cylinders, the company will be able to <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/8/20/9180107/snapchat-losing-money-billion"">make a lot of money</a>.</li> \n<li>Uber's last fundraising round valued the company at $50 billion, and critics have argued that this value is hard to justify even if Uber eventually takes over the entire taxi market, which generates around $11 billion in annual revenues. But this might be looking at the market too narrowly — like trying to estimate the value of eBay in 1999 by looking at the revenues of flea markets. Uber hopes to not only dominate the taxi market — both here and abroad — but also to dramatically expand it by drawing in new customers from the suburbs and smaller metro areas. And it's also hoping to enter related markets like food delivery and self-driving cars. If these efforts succeed, Uber <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/12/4/7336433/uber-worth-"">could ultimately be worth a lot more</a> than $50 billion.</li> \n<li>Doug Henwood <a href=""http://www.thenation.com/article/age-of-the-unicorn-how-the-fed-tried-to-fix-the-recession-and-created-the-tech-bubble/"">scoffs</a> that Airbnb — which owns zero hotels — is worth more than Marriott, with its 4,000 hotels. But this is something of an apples-to-oranges comparison. Marriott's business model is to own and operate hotels. Airbnb's business model is to broker the rental of hotels and other lodging owned and operated by others. And Airbnb's business model is a lot easier to scale up quickly. It has taken Marriott 88 years to reach its current size of around 700,000 rooms for rent. Airbnb has gotten to <a href=""https://www.airbnb.com/about/about-us"">1.5 million worldwide listings</a> in just seven years, and there's every reason to think it will continue growing more quickly than conventional hotel chains.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>This isn't to say these companies — or any of the other ""unicorns"" — are guaranteed winners. Obviously, technology startups are risky investments, and some of these companies will fail. But taken as a group, there's every reason to be optimistic about these companies' prospects. Unlike the tech companies of the late 1990s, virtually all of today's unicorns are either generating significant revenues already or have an opportunity to generate revenue using the now-well-understood techniques of online advertising.</p> \n<h3>Low interest rates are a red herring</h3> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3967162/183730043.0.0.jpg"" alt=""Janet Yellen"" data-chorus-asset-id=""3967162""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Fed Chair Janet Yellen. (Jewel Samad/AFP/Getty Images)</p> \n<p>Henwood and Bilton both point to the Federal Reserve, which has kept short-term interest rates near zero for the past seven years, as a major factor in today's alleged technology bubble. As Henwood puts it, ""The latest round of irrational exuberance has almost certainly been fueled by the Federal Reserve’s extraordinary efforts to reflate the economy after the financial crisis.""</p> \n<p>In one sense, he's correct. Basic economic theory says that as interest rates go down, the value of income-producing assets tends to go up. So there's clearly a connection between today's low interest rates and the relatively high value of stocks generally.</p> \n<p>But as Vox's Matt Yglesias has <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/5/28/8679725/bubbles-interest-rates"">pointed out</a>, that's not what a bubble is:</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>Low interest rates are not irrational exuberance. They're not mass hysteria. They're not hype. They're not a search for a greater fool. They're not overconfidence. They are very real. You can <a href=""http://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/interest-rates/Pages/TextView.aspx?data=yield"">look them up on the internet</a>. It is a genuine fact about the world that if you want a safe financial asset these days, you need to accept a very low nominal rate of return. That genuinely makes other asset classes — everything from houses to ordinary stock shares to zany digital media startups — look more appealing than they would be in a world of higher interest rates.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Of course, it's true that if interest rates start rising, the value of technology companies (and companies generally) will fall somewhat. And that could be bad for investors who invested at the old, higher value. But this is true even when interest rates are high: Higher interest rates could always cause asset values to fall. Conversely, interest rates could fall further (short-term rates might be at zero but longer-term rates are not), which would push the value of technology companies up.</p> \n<p>No one — not even Fed Chair Janet Yellen — knows when interest rates will rise or how high they might go. It's true that investors are calibrating their investments to the current interest rate environment, but that's the opposite of a bubble.</p> \n<h3>Tech companies are valuable because the internet is a huge market</h3> \n<p>While people can quibble about the value of any particular startup, the bigger picture here is that the internet is a vastly larger market today than it was in 1999. In 1999, there were fewer than 300 million people online. Today it's close to 3 billion people. And internet users today are far more accustomed to spending money online than they were 16 years ago.</p> \n<p>So there's no reason to be surprised that investors are pouring billions of dollars into internet companies.</p> \n<p>We don't know if Uber, Lyft, or some other company will eventually dominate the taxi business, but it's a reasonable guess that some technology company will do so, and that this company will be highly profitable.</p> \n<p>We can't predict whether any particular messaging or social media app will continue growing in the coming years, but it's a safe bet that users will spend a lot of time communicating online, and that the companies that facilitate that communication will be able to sell a lot of ads.</p> \n<p>We don't know if Zenefits will succeed in revolutionizing the HR industry, or if Slack will manage to replace email as the primary way companies communicate. But it's a safe bet that the companies of the 21st century will use the internet a lot more than those of the 20th, so investing in companies that provide online services to businesses is sensible.</p> \n<p>In short, the internet is becoming increasingly central to the world economy. So it's not surprising that companies building internet-based businesses are more valuable than ever.</p>",Business & Finance
Apple's 16GB iPhone 6S is a serious strategic mistake,http://www.vox.com/2015/9/11/9311203/apple-16gb-iphone6s,A company with more cash than it knows what to do with should think about the long term.,"<p>The unveiling of <a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/apple"">Apple</a>'s latest smartphone, <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/9/9/9295771/iphone-6s-apple-announcement"">the iPhone 6S</a>, showed that Apple has an impressive ability to keep pushing forward the frontiers of hardware design. But the announcement also came with one note that struck sour for even some of the company's biggest fans. The entry-level edition of the phone comes with just 16GB of storage — room for songs, movies, photos, apps, etc. — an amount that was arguably too low even a couple of years back.</p> \n<p> </p> \n<blockquote lang=""en"" class=""twitter-tweet""> \n<p dir=""ltr"" lang=""en""><a href=""https://twitter.com/siracusa"">@siracusa</a> TBT to 2 YEARS AGO when we couldn't believe Apple was sticking with 16 GB. <a href=""http://t.co/eiUHqcPOuN"">pic.twitter.com/eiUHqcPOuN</a></p> \n— Graeme Erickson (@graemeerickson) <a href=""https://twitter.com/graemeerickson/status/642133780405354496"">September 11, 2015</a>\n</blockquote> \n<p> </p> \n<p> \n<script charset=""utf-8"" src=""//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js""></script> \n</p> \n<p>The continued fall in storage prices has made Apple's lack of generosity in this regard more glaring. The <a href=""https://david-smith.org/blog/2015/09/10/16gb-is-a-bad-user-experience/"">user experience of an under-equipped iPhone</a> can be quite bad, and the iPhone 6S comes with features — like the ability to shoot ultra-HD video — that are going to fill up a 16GB phone in the blink of an eye.</p> \n<p>The decision to sell this device isn't beyond explanation — it pretty clearly boosts Apple's profits — but in a broader sense it's not a very sound business strategy. Apple is already an extremely profitable company with an extremely large existing stockpile of cash. But it suffers from some skepticism about its long-term prospects. Under the circumstances, it ought to leap at an easy opportunity to trade a little profitability now in order to lay the foundation for more success down the road.</p> \n<h3>A 16GB entry-level unit drives higher margins</h3> \n<p>It's not too hard to figure out what Apple is up to here. Leaving the entry-level unit at 16GB of storage rather than 32GB drives higher profit margins in two ways. One, it reduces the cost of manufacturing the $649 phone, which increases profit margins on sales of the lowest-end model. Second, and arguably more important, it pushes a lot of people who might be happy with a 32GB phone to shell out $749 for the 64GB model. A 64GB flash storage chip is more expensive than a 16GB flash chip, but it's not anywhere near $100 more expensive, so pushing people up the chain increases not just revenue but profit margins.</p> \n<p>So stingy storage on the lowest-end iPhone pushes up Apple's revenue and profit margin, and that's the kind of thing self-interested companies do. Something to whine about perhaps, but not really a shocking story.</p> \n<h3>Apple has more money than it knows what to do with</h3> \n<p>This is fine as far as it goes, but it raises the question of what purpose is served by Apple amassing more money. Apple pays out large (and growing) sums of cash to existing shareholders in the form of dividends and buybacks, but its enormous cash stockpile keeps remorselessly marching up toward $200 billion.</p> \n<p>This highlights the fact that the margin-boosting potential of the 16GB iPhone 6S doesn't serve any actual purpose.</p> \n<p>The marginal extra dollar of iPhone revenue that Apple earns doesn't go into the pockets of shareholders or employees, doesn't finance investment, and isn't realistically going to finance an acquisition. It's just a vague hedge against eventual future bankruptcy. That's a somewhat understandable impulse for an incredibly successful company that actually experienced a near-bankruptcy back in the late 1990s.</p> \n<p>But it doesn't really make a lot of sense.</p> \n<p>Killing the 16GB phone and replacing it with a 32GB model at the low end would obtain things money can't buy — satisfied customers, positive press coverage, goodwill, a reputation for true commitment to excellence, and a demonstrated focus on the long term. A company in Apple's enviable position <em>ought</em> to be pushing the envelop forward on what's considered an acceptable baseline for outfitting a modern digital device, not squeezing extra pennies out of customers for no real reason.</p> \n<!-- CHORUS_VIDEO_EMBED ChorusVideo:77540 -->",Business & Finance
China's vast appetite for raw materials is waning â€” and shaking up the global economy,http://www.vox.com/2015/9/15/9329755/china-commodities-steel-concrete,"China uses as much coal, steel, and concrete as the rest of the world combined.","<p>Over the last 20 years, as China ramped up heavy industry and grew at a torrid pace, the country consumed staggering quantities of raw materials. <a href=""http://www.visualcapitalist.com/china-consumes-mind-boggling-amounts-of-raw-materials-chart/"">This chart</a><span> by Jeff Desjardins of Visual Capitalist gives a sense of the sheer scale involved:</span></p> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""4060922""><img src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4060922/chart-china-consumption-raw-materials11%20(1).jpg""></div> \n<p>China now burns as much coal as the rest of the world combined, and accounts for roughly half the planet's aluminum, steel, and copper consumption, <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.wsj.com/articles/china-remains-a-key-commodities-player-despite-waning-appetites-1440534872"">according to data </a><span>from the Wall Street Journal</span><span>.

This despite only making up 13 percent of global GDP.</span></p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""right"">China's vast appetite for raw materials is now slowing down — creating turmoil around the world</q></p> \n<p>But now comes a major twist. China's economy has been sputtering of late. The old model of relying on investment — building endless factories, highways, airports — and growing at 10 percent each year <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/9/3/9251775/chinas-economic-slowdown"">seems to be hitting diminishing returns</a>. China's growth rate has fallen sharply this year (official stats say 7 percent annual growth, but many analysts suspect the real number is far lower). The country is also trying to transition to a consumption-based economy, similar to what you see in the United States or Europe, which could entail smaller growth rates going forward.</p> \n<p>That means China's vast appetite for raw materials is tapering off, which in turn has had outsized effects on global commodity markets. As China's economy has slowed, the price of oil <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/12/16/7401705/oil-prices-falling"">has fallen by more than half</a> over the past year, while commodities like iron ore, copper, and aluminum have seen drops of <a href=""http://www.wsj.com/articles/china-remains-a-key-commodities-player-despite-waning-appetites-1440534872"">20 percent or more</a> since January.</p> \n<p>That slowdown is having ripple effects around the globe. During the 2000s, China's industrial growth was a huge boon for commodity exporters like Brazil, Argentina, Australia, and even Canada. Now that Chinese demand for raw materials is sagging, many of those countries are struggling — particularly Brazil, which <a href=""http://www.wsj.com/articles/how-brazils-china-driven-commodities-boom-went-bust-1440728049"">has tumbled into recession</a>. Similarly, a big chunk of Africa's export growth since 2005 came from selling raw materials like copper and iron ore to China. Those countries <a href=""http://qz.com/485979/these-are-the-industries-in-africa-that-most-fear-a-chinese-slowdown/"">are now taking a hit</a>.</p> \n<p><span>Not </span><span>everyone</span><span> loses out, mind you: If waning Chinese demand drives down the price of crude oil, that's a boon for petroleum consumers in places like the United States and Europe. Same goes for, say, users of industrial metals who would benefit from cheaper costs.</span></p> \n<p>Meanwhile, China isn't going to disappear overnight. Even if slower growth becomes the norm, it will remain the world's biggest consumer of raw materials for years to come. And if China makes the switch to a consumption-based economic model, that will propel demand for other ""soft"" commodities — say, coffee instead of concrete. But as the chart shows, China is so vast that even small blips can reshape global markets, causing turmoil around the world.</p> \n<h3>Further reading:</h3> \n<ul> \n<li><a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/9/3/9251775/chinas-economic-slowdown"">China's economic slowdown: 11 things to know</a></li> \n<li> <span>Last year, I </span><a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonkblog/wp/2014/02/13/how-chinas-hunt-for-raw-materials-is-changing-the-world/"">interviewed</a><span> Michael Levi and Elizabeth Economy about their book on how China's appetite for raw materials was affecting global economics and geopolitics.

This, of course, runs against the conventional wisdom that <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/10/30/7083499/you-should-be-saving-more"">people should be saving around 15 percent of their income</a> throughout their careers.</p> \n<p>The article, written by Lauren Martin, sets up bizarre dichotomy in which people have to choose between career opportunities and a social life <em>or</em> saving money in their 20s. But let's try to take this seriously, as opposed to as a simple act of trolling. A few thoughts:</p> \n<p>1. One kernel of truth in Martin's argument is that there are times when spending money   — even in seemingly wasteful ways — can make sense. For example, if you're in a career where networking is important, it may be smart to spend money to take full advantage of social opportunities. You might want to spend a bit extra to live near other young people in your industry. Taxi fares and bar tabs can be seen as investments in relationships that will pay professional dividends for decades to come.</p> \n<p>2. But spending beyond your means on this kind of thing only makes sense for a limited period of time. For your first year or two after moving to a new city or entering a new profession, it might make sense to spend extra to help you become better connected. If after several years, you're still spending so much on your social life that you're not accumulating any savings, then something needs to give.</p> \n<p>3. You don't want to get to your 30s or 40s and find you have no money in the bank. Seriously. And while your 30s and 40s — and kids, and spouses, and sick parents — may seem a lifetime away in your 20s, they are closer than you think. Sorry.</p> \n<p>4. Martin, writing about her sad life before she had her no-saving epiphany, writes that ""I was trying to save, which meant trying not to eat. I wasn’t going out with friends, had yet to go to a club and had never seen the inside of a taxi."" This gets to a common misconception about how people get in financial trouble.</p> \n<p>5. The problem usually isn't daily, discretionary expenses like cab fare or a bar tab. You can always cut those out when you need to. The problem is big-ticket, fixed costs. The biggest of these, especially if you live in a big city, is rent. If you can trim 10 or 20 percent off of your monthly housing costs — perhaps by getting a smaller apartment, moving to a less popular neighborhood, or getting a roommate — that can make a much larger difference to your budget than cutting out small-ticket luxuries like a morning cup of coffee.</p> \n<p>6. That's why, when you look at the extreme early retirement community — the folks who stop working in their 30s — their <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/5/1/8518455/extreme-early-retirement"">secret</a> is usually that they live somewhere super cheap.</p> \n<p>7. American culture encourages people to behave like they're richer than they really are. Many people find it awkward and a little embarrassing to admit that the reason they don't want to go out is that they can't afford it. But that can lead to a bad equilibrium where <em>everyone</em> is spending more money than they want to. It's a shitty thing that we all do to each other without meaning to.</p> \n<p>8. Luckily, this isn't actually a hard problem to solve, it just requires a bit of honest communication. Unless your friends are assholes, they're likely to be perfectly willing to come have a drink at your apartment instead of the bar. And there's a good chance they'll appreciate the savings as well as the company.</p>",Business & Finance
"The ad blocking controversy, explained",http://www.vox.com/2015/9/18/9351759/ad-blocking-controversy,Apple's latest iPhone operating system has launched a broad debate about the future of media.,"<p>The internet is suddenly awash in commentary about ad blocking and ad blockers. The genre that reached its apogee in <a href=""http://www.theawl.com/2015/09/welcome-to-the-block-party"">Casey Johnston's ad blocker thinkpiece for The Awl</a> — which was, in turn, inspired by things like <a href=""http://www.marco.org/2015/08/11/ad-blocking-ethics"">Marco Arment's commentary on the ethics of ad blocking</a>, <a href=""http://fortune.com/2015/08/13/publishers-only-have-themselves-to-blame-for-the-ad-blocking-apocalypse/"">Matthew Ingram's publisher-blaming commentary</a>, an ongoing series of articles on the subject by <a href=""http://www.mondaynote.com/2015/08/03/what-the-ad-blocker-debate-reveals/"">Jean Louis-Gassé </a><a href=""http://www.mondaynote.com/2015/08/03/what-the-ad-blocker-debate-reveals/"">t</a>hat <a href=""http://www.mondaynote.com/2015/08/03/what-the-ad-blocker-debate-reveals/"">has been published at his Monday Note blog</a> for months now, Ben Thompson's ""<a href=""https://stratechery.com/2015/why-web-pages-suck/"">Why Web Pages Suck</a>,"" and Nilay Patel's ""<a href=""http://www.theverge.com/2015/7/20/9002721/the-mobile-web-sucks"">The Mobile Web Sucks</a>"" (and even more ominously <a href=""http://www.theverge.com/2015/9/17/9338963/welcome-to-hell-apple-vs-google-vs-facebook-and-the-slow-death-of-the-web"" target=""_blank"">""Welcome to Hell""</a>).</p> \n<p>The dispute is about software. Specifically about ""extensions"" that can be added to (some) web browsers and about JavaScript that runs as part of (some) web ads. It's a discussion that's been running for a long time, but has kicked into overdrive because of Apple's release of a new operating system for iPhones and the launch of new services like Facebook Instant Articles and Apple News. And it's something you'll be hearing more and more about if you read things online, because it touches on something very near and dear to every online writer's heart — whether we can make money publishing on the internet, and the sneaking suspicion that the reasonably journalist-friendly economic climate of the past two or three years may be a mirage.</p> \n<h3>Apple's iOS 9 will allow ad blockers on mobile Safari</h3> \n<p>Desktop web browsers — Firefox, Chrome, Safari, and Internet Explorer — have long made it possible to install <em>browser extensions</em> that give your browser additional capabilities. One popular class of extensions: various forms of ""ad blockers,"" which attempt to sift through the code of the sites you are browsing and prevent the ads from loading.</p> \n<p>In principle, the makers of these browsers <em>could </em>include ad-blocking functionality out of the box — and even enable it by default.</p> \n<p>Indeed, that's already happened once in the past. Once upon a time, the internet advertising landscape was littered with ""pop-up"" ads that would automatically spawn a new window when you browsed to a site. That led to the creation of pop-up blockers; eventually, pop-up blocking became a stock feature on most modern web browsers. But desktop browser makers have not chosen to do this to block all ads — so while ad blocking software is popular among some power users, it's a decidedly niche marketplace.</p> \n<p>It also doesn't exist at all on Apple's iPhones and other iOS devices, because you can't use browser extensions on Apple's mobile Safari. Not, that is, until iOS 9, the latest iteration of the operating system, which <em>does </em>allow for selective-content-blocking extensions. This feature was previewed to developers months ago, and the developers have been <a href=""http://www.loopinsight.com/2015/09/16/a-list-of-content-blockers-for-ios-9/"">plugging away at creating </a>extensions that will work with iOS 9.</p> \n<p>Ad blocking is getting more attention, fundamentally, because people think that Apple's move is going to make it a lot more mainstream.</p> \n<h3>Technological change doesn't alter ad spending</h3> \n<p>Interestingly, evidence from <em>past</em> technological shifts suggests that whatever happens with ad blocking technology, it is unlikely to alter the total amount of money spent on advertising. The media industry has changed a great deal since the 1940s. Broadcast television became a thing. It went color. Cable TV was invented. It went digital. Terrestrial radio declined without vanishing. Newspapers boomed and then busted. The internet came around. And all this technological change was deeply intertwined with the advertising industry.</p> \n<p>But as Eric Chemi showed in a fascinating Bloomberg article last year, <a href=""http://www.bloomberg.com/bw/articles/2014-03-03/advertisings-century-of-flat-line-growth"">aggregate advertising spending barely budged at all</a>:</p> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""4070486""><img src=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4070486/ADS_industry_percent_GDP.jpg""></div> \n<p>This means that there is a zero-sum element to change in the advertising industry. The rise of new media does not expand the total pie — it grabs a bigger slice away from old media. Ad spending stays consistent at 1 to 2 percent of GDP, no matter what.</p> \n<p>Conversely, if content blockers render a whole class of ad spending ineffective, the spending won't vanish — it will pop up someplace else. So to the extent that ad blocking is bad for <em>some</em> ad-supported companies, it will be good for some other companies.</p> \n<p>The big question is who will win and who will lose. Three big shifts seem likely:</p> \n<ul> \n<li>A shift away from programmatic display ads in favor of ""native"" ads.</li> \n<li>A shift away from mid-sized publications, in favor of publications that are either big enough to support a sophisticated sales operation or small enough to have low revenue needs.</li> \n<li>A shift away from the web into mobile app platforms that can provide a more controlled experience.</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>The rise of ""native"" ads</h3> \n<p>Conceptually, an ad is basically something you publish because somebody paid you money to publish it. Ad blocking software can identify ad networks, and block certain kinds of advertising scripts, but it can't read minds and discern <em>why</em> a given story was published. Consequently, forms of advertising that fit natively into the editorial content stream should be immune to ad blocking.</p> \n<p>John Gruber's <a href=""http://daringfireball.net/"">Daring Fireball</a> is a very successful one-man operation that will likely <em>benefit</em><em>.</em> Take this post from his site, for example:</p> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""4070494""><img src=""https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4070494/Screen%20Shot%202015-09-17%20at%206.08.51%20AM.png""></div> \n<p>From the perspective of ad blocking software, this doesn't look like an ad, it just looks like a regular post. The subject of the post just happens to be Igloo and the virtues of their product, and the <em>reason</em> the post appears is because of a monetary transaction. In other words, it's an ad. But no ad blocker is going to block it.</p> \n<p>This is a small-scale version of what larger media companies have taken to calling ""native"" advertising — advertising that appears in line with editorial content and is formatted to closely resemble editorial content, albeit with clear labeling. In this case it's a weekly ""thank you"" note from the author of the blog to the sponsor of the week.</p> \n<p>Native ad campaigns — usually slicker than the Daring Fireball ones with higher production values (see, e.g., this recent <a href=""http://www.vox.com/sponsored/8864635/walmart-infographic-domestic-manufacturing-local-economy"">Vox Creative campaign for Walmart</a>) — have been the big trend in the industry for a couple of years now, and ad blocking would only accelerate that trend.</p> \n<h3>Mid-sized publishers will probably lose out</h3> \n<p>The bulk of modern programmatic advertising is heavily dependent on computer software. When your browser loads a site it activates various ""trackers"" that attempt to ascertain who you are and what kind of advertisers might want to reach you. This is why, when I was shopping for a lamp recently, suddenly my web experience was dominated by lamp ads.</p> \n<p>Critics often find this kind of tracking creepy but programmatic ad selling, despite perennial complaints about invasions of privacy and the low rates it pays, is a godsend to smaller operations because it drastically reduces the need for sales overhead. It has allowed small editorial teams to focus on growing and cultivating their audience, while monetization happens largely in the background.</p> \n<p>""Adblocker is brutal for us,"" Nicole Cliffe, co-founder and co-editor of <a href=""http://the-toast.net/"">The Toast</a>, told <a href=""http://www.theawl.com/2015/09/welcome-to-the-block-party"">Casey Johnson for her ad blocking piece in The Awl</a>. At the Awl itself, according to Johnson's article, 75-85 percent of all revenue comes from streams that are susceptible to ad blocking.</p> \n<h3>Content (and ads) may flee to the apps</h3> \n<p>If you do a lot of your reading by following the Snapchat Discover channels published daily by CNN, ESPN, Cosmopolitan, Mashable, and others, then ad blocking software isn't going to change your life very much. You view those channels using your Snapchat app, not using a web browser, so browser extensions don't accomplish anything for you. By the same token, publishers with Discover channels can monetize to their heart's content without fear of ad blockers.</p> \n<p>Apple News, which launched with iOS 9 right alongside the new mobile ad blocking powers, is another example of a browser-free mode of content consumption. Apple is going to serve ads from inside the News app, and there'll be no blocking there.</p> \n<p>Nor does ad blocking software affect the newsfeed inside your Facebook app. And Facebook is rolling out a product it calls <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/5/13/8600753/facebook-instant-articles-explained"">""instant"" articles</a>, basically articles that you will read without ever leaving your Facebook app. Back in the early summer many smart observers (including <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/7/22/9013911/is-the-media-becoming-a-wire-service"">Vox.com editor in chief Ezra Klein</a>) saw this kind of distribution to app-based platforms as the future of media even <em>without </em>dwelling on the possible effect of browser ad blocking.</p> \n<p>But to the extent that the more open nature of web browsing turns the browser experience into one that's difficult to monetize, that trend will only accelerate. Instead of digital media brands being companies that build websites, they will operate more like television studios — bringing together teams that collaborate on the creation of content, which is then distributed through diverse channels that are not themselves controlled by the studio.</p> \n<p>This may or may not work as a sustainable business model, but it also raises fundamental questions about power.</p> \n<p>""These larger firms will insist on calling these relationships 'partnerships,'"" <a href=""http://www.theawl.com/2015/07/in-no-charts"">John Herrman writes</a>, ""but they will be nothing of the sort."" Platform-owning technology companies will systematically hold the upper hand in negotiations. That most immediately implicates media companies' business models and content strategies, but, more broadly, it raises questions about freedom of speech and the nature of the public sphere.</p> \n<h3>Ad blocking fans see blocking as a moral imperative</h3> \n<p>These various trends have sparked a fierce and moralistic argument about the ethics of ad blocking. Marco Arment, the <a href=""http://www.marco.org/2015/09/16/peace-content-blocker"">developer of one of the most popular mobile ad blockers</a>, wrote that ad blocking was<a href=""http://www.marco.org/2015/08/11/ad-blocking-ethics"">something like a moral imperative</a>:</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>Web ads are dramatically different from prior ad media, though — rather than just being printed on paper or inserted into a broadcast, web ads are <em>software</em>. They run arbitrary code on your computer, which can (and usually does) collect and send data about you and your behavior back to the advertisers and publishers. And there’s so much consolidation amongst ad networks and analytics providers that they can easily track your behavior across multiple sites, building a creepily accurate and deep profile of your personal information and private business.</p> \n<p>All of that tracking and data collection is done without your knowledge, and — critically — without your consent. Because of how the web and web browsers work, the involuntary data collection starts if you simply follow a link. There’s no opportunity for disclosure, negotiation, or reconsideration. By following <em>any</em> link, you unwittingly opt into whatever the target site, and any number of embedded scripts from other sites and tracking networks, wants to collect, track, analyze, and sell about you.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Similarly, Gruber argues that his approach to advertising isn't just a savvy business strategy — it's an <a href=""http://daringfireball.net/linked/2015/09/16/because-of-apple"">important stance in favor of readers</a>:</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>I see the fact that Daring Fireball’s revenue streams should remain unaffected by Safari content-blocking as affirmation that my choices over the last decade have been correct: that I should put my readers’ interests first, and only publish the sort of ads and sponsorships that I myself would want to be served, even if that means leaving (significant) amounts of money on the table along the way.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>These arguments seem a bit like post hoc rationalizations. When people DVR television shows, they normally fast forward past the ads. Television ads don't involve intrusive JavaScript trackers, or have problematic consequences for battery life. People skip the ads (at least I do) because it is technically possible to skip the ads, because I don't particularly want to see the ads, and because I don't believe my personal decision about whether or not to watch the ads is going to make or break the show. I do that even though I work for an advertising-dependent website, and even though my father is a writer for an advertising-dependent show on NBC.</p> \n<p>People block ads because they can, and if they can block more ads they will.</p> \n<h3>Critics see ad blocking as deeply unethical</h3> \n<p>On the flip side, critics of ad blocking see a plot to destroy the underlying revenue stream of beloved publications.</p> \n<blockquote class=""twitter-tweet"" lang=""en""> \n<p lang=""en"" dir=""ltr"">When you block ads, you fuck over people who make things you like on the web. Own up to that. <a href=""http://t.co/ovCg2LCNFa"">http://t.co/ovCg2LCNFa</a></p> \n— laura olin (@lauraolin) <a href=""https://twitter.com/lauraolin/status/644495386833457153"">September 17, 2015</a>\n</blockquote> \n<blockquote class=""twitter-tweet"" lang=""en""> \n<p lang=""en"" dir=""ltr"">Next person who replies to me with ""But ads are annoying!!!"" gets blocked</p> \n— laura olin (@lauraolin) <a href=""https://twitter.com/lauraolin/status/644545248392278016"">September 17, 2015</a>\n</blockquote> \n<p> \n<script src=""//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"" charset=""utf-8""></script> \n</p> \n<p>Indeed, Arment himself <a href=""http://www.marco.org/2015/09/18/just-doesnt-feel-good"" target=""_blank"">rapidly experienced seller's remorse</a> about the success of his ad blocker and pulled it from the app store.</p> \n<p>""Ad blockers come with an important asterisk: while they do benefit a ton of people in major ways,"" he writes, ""they also hurt some, including many who don't deserve the hit.""</p> \n<p>In truth, however, the shift toward native advertising and toward partner platforms rather than websites was under way well <em>before</em> Apple announced the arrival of mobile ad blocking on iOS 9. It's plausible that very few people will actually bother to install ad blockers, but even if that happens the basic trend will remain the same. Advertisers will pay for more native campaigns, and readers will prefer app-based experiences that can deliver faster load times and a smoother user interface.</p> \n<p>These trends are troubling to many in the media because, fundamentally, the industry has had a rough time of things and it was just starting to look sunnier. The media industry entered a recession with the rest of the United States at the turn of the millennium, but then it never really recovered. When I went to my first happy hour as a full-time employee of a magazine back in 2003, my colleagues greeted me with a toast: ""welcome to a dying industry.""</p> \n<p>And for years that's how it looked. The web was taking attention and serving readers, but it wasn't making any money. Then after years of struggle, the advertising market collapsed in the face of a new, bigger recession in 2008. As the American economy climbed back from that recession, this time around the media industry came with it. Suddenly there were successful new venture-backed startups. But the New York Times was growing too. And so was a holdover from the 90s internet like Slate. And so was a bootstrapped company like Gawker. And Jeff Bezos was investing new money into the Washington Post. And Disney was launching exciting new digital brands around Bill Simmons and Nate Silver.</p> \n<p>Anxiety about ad blockers, platform-owners, native campaigns and the rest is a queasy feeling that maybe the future's not so bright after all — that commercial success will depend on compliance with the whims and strategic objectives of much larger companies who, whatever their virtues, aren't inspired by the values and objectives that lead people to pursue media careers in the first place.</p>",Business & Finance
"Sunday's Greek election, explained",http://www.vox.com/2015/9/19/9353749/sundays-greek-election-explained, ,"<p>Greece is having an election on Sunday! Yes, they had a legislative election in January. And yes they had a <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/7/5/8890163/greece-referendum-best-arguments"">big referendum</a> back in July. But the economic and political crisis in Greece is sufficiently severe as to require yet another round of voting. And while back when the election was first called it looked like it would be an easy win for Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras, polling now shows a neck-and-neck race with his main opponent slightly favored.</p> \n<p>At this point, both of the main parties favor accommodating demands from Greece's European creditors so the election is unlikely to spark a new round of economic and political chaos. But this is Greece, and Tsipras and his Syriza party have surprised outsiders many times before so don't entirely count economic and political chaos out.</p> \n<h3>Who is running?</h3> \n<p>There are two leading parties in the election:</p> \n<ul> \n<li>Syriza, the party that's been in power since early 2015. They came into office promising to rip up previous austerity agreements with European creditors, but were forced to make a humiliating climbdown this summer after it became clear that they didn't have any leverage.</li> \n<li>New Democracy, the traditional center-right party that governed before Syriza took office. There used to be huge policy disagreements between New Democracy and the far-left Syriza, but after Syriza's flip-flop on the austerity issue they disagree a lot less.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>There's also PASOK, the formerly dominant center-left party that was marginalized by Syriza's rise, and which also supports accommodating the Germans. There's Potami, a newish centrist party that's never held office. There's Popular Unity, which consists of former Syriza members who opposed the European deal. And there's the neo-fascist party Golden Dawn.</p> \n<h3>What is going to happen?</h3> \n<p>The polls show a tight race between Syriza and New Democracy, followed by a close bunching of the smaller parties.</p> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""4075714""><img src=""https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4075714/Greece_polls_2015-1.png""></div> \n<p>That's a big change from the immediate aftermath of Tspiras making a deal with Greece's creditors. For a moment during the summer, he was the absolute master of the Greek political scene having marginalized his rivals to both his right and his left. The high-profile confrontation with European finance ministers cast Tsipras as the embodiment of Greek national interests. The subsequent electoral campaign seems to have succeeded in allowing New Democracy to re-active the underlying ideological disagreements in the Greek population — consolidating most of the right-wing vote behind them while most of the left-wing vote goes for Syriza.</p> \n<h3>How does the election work?</h3> \n<p>Greece elects a 300-person parliament on a proportional basis, but with two significant twists.</p> \n<ul> \n<li>Parties that get less than 3 percent of the vote get zero seats in parliament.</li> \n<li>Whichever party gets the most votes gets 50 seats.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>These deviations from proportionality can be very significant. The most recent poll, for example, shows Potami securing about 4.6 percent of the vote which should be good for 12 seats. But if Potami loses half its support and get 2.3 percent of the vote, they don't get six seats — they get zero seats.</p> \n<p>That same poll showed Syriza with 31.7 percent of the vote and New Democracy with 30.9 percent of the vote. In a purely proportional system, that would leave Syriza and ND with basically the same number of seats. But in the actual voting system that projects out to 134 seats for Syriza and just 82 for New Democracy.</p> \n<p>In other words, while the neck-and-neck race for first place between Syriza and New Democracy isn't quite as consequential as it would be in a zero-sum election (like a US presidential race) it's a much bigger deal than it would be in a more proportional system.</p> \n<h3>Is there going to be an exciting new crisis?</h3> \n<p>Probably not. It looks like the election will either allow a Syriza-PASOK left-wing coalition to secure a majority or else will allow an ND/PASOK/Potami center-right coalition to secure a majority.</p> \n<p>The big background to all of this is that whatever their disagreements, these four parties all fundamentally agree that Greece should continue participating in the Eurozone and that means acceding to the key demands of Greece's creditors. The creditors, in turn, have a set of prescriptions that are sufficiently rigorous as to deny the Greek government many choices to make. The parties that want to break with the EU — Golden Dawn and Popular Unity — are both looking marginalized.</p> \n<p>Consequently, it sure <em>seems</em> like there shouldn't be a crisis.</p> \n<p>That said, you could imagine a situation in which the numbers work out such that the only way to form a majority would be to have a cabinet that included both Syriza and New Democracy. So-called ""grand coalition"" governments of that sort are commonplace in some countries, but can be tricky to get off the ground where they haven't existed before. Given the circumstances of the bailout deal with Europe, the actual policy differences between Syriza and ND are modest but there's no history of cooperation between these parties and the differences in social bases of support and self-conception between a radical left party and a conservative establishment party are large.</p> \n<p>If a grand coalition becomes necessary, but coalition talks get difficult, you could start to see rumblings of complaint from Brussels, Frankfurt, and Berlin and a new round of economic uncertainty.</p>",Business & Finance
This photo shows how researchers caught VW cheating on its emissions tests,http://www.vox.com/2015/9/23/9383663/vw-emissions-scandal-photo,Researchers at West Virginia University measured emissions while driving up and down the West Coast.,"<p>Revelations that as many as 11 million Volkswagen cars have been <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/9/21/9365667/volkswagen-clean-diesel-recall-passenger-cars"">cheating on their emissions tests</a> have become big news this week. But the research that demonstrated that VW's diesel vehicles were generating excessive pollution has been publicly available for more than a year — ever since a team at West Virginia University <a href=""http://www.theicct.org/sites/default/files/publications/WVU_LDDV_in-use_ICCT_Report_Final_may2014.pdf"">published their findings</a> in the spring of 2014.</p> \n<p>Volkswagen reportedly programmed its vehicles to behave differently during emissions testing than in real-world driving conditions. To detect this, the West Virginia researchers developed a method for measuring a vehicle's emissions performance as it drove down the highway. Here's what it looked like:</p> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""4089558""><img src=""https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4089558/Screen%20Shot%202015-09-23%20at%2010.25.40%20AM.png""></div> \n<p>This equipment rode around in the back of the vehicles they were testing, collecting gas from the exhaust pipe and analyzing it. The gear included an onboard generator, to make sure that the power demands of the testing equipment didn't change the performance of the engine.</p> \n<p>Then they drove the vehicles up and down the West Coast, testing their performance in a variety of real-world driving conditions, from city streets to mountain roads. They found that one of the vehicles they tested (we now know it was a VW Jetta) was emitting 15 to 35 times the legal limit of nitrogen oxides, while another (a VW Passat) was emitting five to 20 times the limit.</p> \n<p>At this point, the researchers didn't know <em>why</em> the cars were emitting so much pollution. But when they presented their results at a 2014 conference in San Diego, there were <a href=""http://spectrum.ieee.org/cars-that-think/transportation/advanced-cars/how-professors-caught-vw-cheating"">EPA officials in the audience</a>. They picked up the investigation from there and eventually forced Volkswagen to admit that they had programmed the vehicles to cheat on emissions tests.</p>",Business & Finance
Arguments for higher interest rates are getting weirder and more desperate,http://www.vox.com/2015/9/23/9384259/trimmed-mean-inflation,It's time to leave well enough alone and let workers get some raises.,"<p>The Federal Reserve's key <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/9/16/9340469/federal-reserve-rate-decision"">interest rates</a> have been very low for a long time now, and the <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/8/27/9215629/september-fed-interest-rates"">labor market is in at least okay shape</a>, so calls for tighter money are getting louder from almost every corner. One huge problem for these calls, though, is that the point of tight money is supposed to be to control inflation. And right now inflation is way <em>below</em> the Federal Reserve's 2 percent target, and it's been below that target for years.</p> \n<p>But a lot of people want to raise rates anyway, and they're making two somewhat dubious arguments to bolster their case. One is to say that we should ignore the inflation rate the Fed has set as its target, and use another one instead. The other is to make misguided assertions about the ways interest rates influence the economy, in order to gin up non-inflation rationales for tighter money.</p> \n<h3>The Fed is below target by any measure</h3> \n<p>On inflation metric funny business, Rich Miller has a piece in Bloomberg titled <a href=""http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-09-23/the-fed-is-a-lot-closer-to-its-target-using-this-inflation-measure"">""The Fed Is a Lot Closer to Its Target Using This Inflation Measure.""</a></p> \n<p>The measure in question is the <a href=""http://www.dallasfed.org/research/pce/"">Dallas Fed's ""trimmed mean"" PCE</a> deflator. This is part of a family of alternate inflation measures that attempt to improve on the instability of overall price indexes. The oldest and best-known of these are so-called ""core"" inflation measurements that simply throw food and energy prices out of the basket on the grounds that food and energy prices are very unstable. Trimmed mean is a more sophisticated way of doing the same thing — each month you throw out the fastest-growing and fastest-falling prices, ""trimming"" the inflation index to ignore the impact of weird outliers.</p> \n<p>Of the different approaches along these lines, I'm most a fan of the <a href=""https://www.clevelandfed.org/en/Our%20Research/Indicators%20and%20Data/Current%20Median%20CPI.aspx"">Cleveland Fed's median CPI</a>.</p> \n<p>But whatever you think of these alternate indexes, here are two key points:</p> \n<ul> \n<li>The Fed has given itself a mandate to target 2 percent inflation as measured by the PCE deflator. Just switching ad hoc to different indexes will undermine predictability, stability, the rule of law, etc. </li> \n<li>All the different indexes show inflation well below 2 percent!</li> \n</ul> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""4089468""><img src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4089468/inflation%20measure.png""></div> \n<p>This last one is important. It's true that using Trimmed PCE shows we are undershooting 2 percent by only a modest amount, while Median CPI and Core PCE both show undershooting by a slightly larger amount, and pure PCE shows massive undershooting. But directionally, all these measurements show the same thing — inflation is not too high, so if the point of higher interest rates is to control inflation, there is no case for higher interest rates.</p> \n<h3>Low interest rates don't stymie investment</h3> \n<p>Meanwhile, over in the <a href=""http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/52304e9a-6052-11e5-a28b-50226830d644.html"">Financial Times, Danielle DiMartino Booth offers</a> an even more bizarre argument for higher interest rates. She accuses the Fed of ""ignoring rising inflation"" even though inflation is not, in fact, rising.</p> \n<p>And then she argues that low interest rates are causing companies to not invest:</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>In the meantime, Fed policy has facilitated bad behaviour. Corporate chieftains, a breed long plagued with short-termitis, have been encouraged to trespass further by the siren call of cheap money. Why bother investing in the long term when it is so much more fun, to say nothing of more lucrative, to buy back shares, reduce share count and puff up profits?</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>The trend toward executives using borrowing to finance share buybacks rather than investment appears to be real (see <a href=""http://rooseveltinstitute.org/sites/all/files/Mason_Disgorge_the_Cash.pdf"">JW Mason's research</a> for more on this), but it has nothing to do with the current state of interest rates. An executive has to make the calculation, ""Is it better for the value of my stock options to invest this borrowed money or to spend it on share buybacks?"" Interest rates plausibly influence the <em>quantity</em> of borrowing that companies do, since lower rates make borrowing cheaper. But there's no reason for them to influence the split between buybacks and investment.</p> \n<h3>It's time to admit we don't have a problem</h3> \n<p>Economic commentators seem to have a great deal of difficulty with this, but it's time to admit that at the moment the United States simply isn't facing a serious business cycle problem. Unemployment is on the low side, but so is inflation. Cheap commodity prices are giving everyone a boost, there are a lot of able-bodied adults who may or may not rejoin the workforce in the near future, and after a long stretch of weak wage growth there's room for people to get some raises without corporate profits being squeezed to an untenable level.</p> \n<p>Things are basically fine, and while a small increase in interest rates almost certainly wouldn't be ruinous, there's also no reason to do it.</p>",Business & Finance
"""Silicon Valley"" is moving farther and farther from Silicon Valley",http://www.vox.com/2015/9/24/9387007/uber-oakland-san-francisco,High rents in Silicon Valley and San Francisco have led Uber to open an office in Oakland.,"<p>People use the phrase ""Silicon Valley"" as a shorthand for the technology industry, much as they use ""Wall Street"" to describe the financial industry.</p> \n<p>But <a href=""http://www.npr.org/2011/10/24/141651006/whats-on-wall-street-fewer-banks-more-condos"">much like ""Wall Street,""</a> the term has become increasingly inaccurate. It's still true that the San Francisco Bay Area is the center of the technology sector. But within the Bay Area, the industry's center of mass has been shifting steadily northward, away from towns like Palo Alto and Mountain View toward San Francisco itself. Yelp, Dropbox, Airbnb, Slack, and Twitter all have their corporate headquarters in or near San Francisco's Soma neighborhood:</p> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""4090946""><img src=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4090946/Screen%20Shot%202015-09-23%20at%203.52.57%20PM.png""></div> \n<p>On Wednesday, a major tech company announced plans to move some of its workers even farther from Silicon Valley. Uber is <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.mercurynews.com/bay-area-news/ci_28863600/uber-expand-headquarters-oakland-buys-former-downtown-sears"">opening new offices in Oakland</a>, on the other side of the San Francisco Bay — while simultaneously keeping offices in San Francisco.</p> \n<p>Uber is hardly the first technology company to locate in Oakland — Ask.com has had a major presence there for a while — but Uber is the most prominent technology company to establish a major presence on the east side of the bay. And there's good reason to think it won't be the last.</p> \n<p>Two big forces have been pushing technology companies up the San Francisco peninsula. One is a serious space shortage. Strict building regulations in all the major Silicon Valley municipalities has made it impossible for the high-tech economy to continue expanding in Silicon Valley proper. As Google, Facebook, Apple, and other companies have grabbed every available square foot of office space they could find, it became unaffordable for new companies to continue taking root there.</p> \n<p>Second, San Francisco has been enjoying the same kind of urban revival we've seen in other cities across the United States. So over the past decade, founders looking for alternatives to Silicon Valley proper have generally looked toward San Francisco. The city's Soma neighborhood happens to be the terminus of the CalTrain that connects Silicon Valley to San Francisco.</p> \n<p>The problem is that <a href=""http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/S-F-law-blocks-tech-boom-expansion-5652707.php"">San Francisco isn't very friendly</a> to the development of office space, either. You might think the city could make room for a lot of additional companies by building more skyscrapers downtown, but a <a href=""http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/S-F-law-blocks-tech-boom-expansion-5652707.php"">1986 law</a> caps the number of square feet of office space that gets built in the city each year. So now that San Francisco has become a thriving center of the technology sector, companies there are once again facing space shortages.</p> \n<p>So companies are looking to move to Oakland, repeating the cycle.</p> \n<p>Yet despite San Francisco's business-hostile climate, the city is likely to remain the center of region's (and probably the world's) technology sector in the long run. The region's transportation infrastructure is oriented around carrying people to and from the city — not Oakland or Cupertino — so companies located downtown are always going to have some inherent advantages. And while Oakland real estate is comparatively cheap now, that advantage is likely to dissipate if more technology companies move to the East Bay.</p> \n<p>Still, San Francisco is leaving a lot of money on the table by making it so difficult for technology companies to bring jobs and tax dollars into the city.</p>",Business & Finance
How China is playing Boeing against Airbus to build its own airplane industry,http://www.vox.com/2015/9/24/9389767/boeing-china-deal,The real reason Boeing is opening a factory in China â€” it's not the Export-Import Bank.,"<p>For the first time ever, Boeing is <a href=""http://www.wsj.com/articles/boeing-plans-new-deal-in-china-1442955334"">locating an aircraft production facility abroad</a> — in China — as part of a bundled deal to <a href=""http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/09/23/china-buy-300-boeing-planes/72681578/"">sell 300 new planes to Chinese airlines and leasing companies</a>. Companies moving production to China is an old story, of course, but Boeing isn't just new to the Chinese market — this is the first time it's <em>ever </em>built a factory abroad. That makes it a huge deal in the deeply politicized aviation industry, and many <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/lorenthompson/2015/09/23/boeing-to-build-its-first-offshore-plane-factory-in-china-as-ex-im-bank-withers/"">smell a link</a> to the demise of the <a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/export-import-bank/what-is-the-export-import-bank"" target=""_blank"">Export-Import Bank</a>, since Boeing was the biggest beneficiary of its largesse.</p> \n<p>But this is also a story about <em>Chinese</em> public policy, and it highlights at least one respect in which the country's state-dominated economic growth model (<a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/9/3/9251775/chinas-economic-slowdown"">whatever its other flaws</a>) works better than freer markets — the country can coherently pursue multi-pronged efforts to develop new domestic industries by leveraging the scale of its domestic consumer market. The Chinese want to develop a domestic airplane manufacturing industry. But building large airplanes is difficult. So they've been playing Boeing and its major competitor off each other to get both companies to help teach a Chinese company how to do it. Lenin famously said that ""the capitalists will sell us the rope we use to hang them,"" and while neither company really wants to help create a new rival, neither is willing to cede control over the Chinese market to the other.</p> \n<h3>Boeing scored a huge sale to the Chinese government</h3> \n<p>In total, the planes Boeing has agreed to <a href=""http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-09-23/china-signs-deal-to-buy-300-boeing-aircraft-xinhua-reports"">sell are worth about $38 billion</a> — an enormous sum of money. That's spread across three separate airlines and an aircraft leasing company, but all three airlines are state-owned enterprises, and the leasing company is a subsidiary of a bank that's also state-owned.</p> \n<p>The deal, in other words, is entirely controlled by the Chinese government, which, of course, wants a good deal on quality airplanes but also has a larger set of policy objectives.</p> \n<h3>Boeing is opening a Chinese factory to catch up to Airbus</h3> \n<p>In the United States, privately owned airlines choose to buy large aircraft from either Boeing or Airbus, Boeing's European rival, based on a relatively narrow set of business considerations. But while the Chinese government isn't indifferent to the quality of a plane purchasing deal qua deal, it also looks at other political factors.</p> \n<p>In recent years the bulk of Chinese aircraft purchases have come from Airbus. Not coincidentally, Airbus has a production facility in Tianjin and is opening a second Chinese factory. Boeing is now opening its own Chinese factory in part to play catch-up — and the announcement is deliberately paired with the announcement of the new sales. The message from the Chinese government to both companies is clear: Your ability to make sales in China is going to be based in part on your willingness to locate factories in China.</p> \n<h3>China is trying to learn how to make airplanes</h3> \n<p>Labor unions representing Boeing's workforce are, naturally, concerned about the impact of the new facility on jobs for their members. But China's leaders are really after something much bigger than a factory full of jobs. They are trying to develop a domestic aviation industry. And to do that, they need workers and managers who know how to build airplanes.</p> \n<p>That's why the Chinese government's state-owned aerospace company has launched a subsidiary called the Commercial Aviation Company of China (Comec) with a mandate to build first the C919, a narrow-body aircraft intended to compete with Boeing's 737 and Airbus's 320, and then with a longer-term ambition to build wide-body airplanes.</p> \n<p>The plant Boeing is going to build in China will be used to put the finishing touches on 737s and will handle the delivery and servicing of the aircraft. It's also going to be a joint venture between Boeing and Comec. In other words, Boeing is going to be training Comec personnel in the skills they need to complete the C919 — an airplane that is designed to put Boeing out of business.</p> \n<h3>China is playing Airbus and Boeing off each other</h3> \n<p>How could Boeing be so careless about its own long-term business interests? Well, in part it's because Boeing's executives need to care about the company's <em>short-term</em> revenue and profits, and the quarterly earnings reports don't care about Comec's long-term vision.</p> \n<p>But in part it's because Boeing believes that Comec is going to master this craft one way or the other. After all, remember that Airbus plant in Tianjin? It's also a joint venture with Comec. So from Boeing's perspective the die has already been cast, and it would be foolish to let Airbus gobble up the entire Chinese market for itself.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, Airbus is probably telling itself that helping the Chinese learn how to do final assembly for the A320 probably isn't <em>that</em> big of a deal because there are a lot of other steps in the aircraft value chain and a lot of bigger, more complicated planes out there. But that's why getting Boeing into the China game is important. Boeing's new Chinese plant is going to be doing basically the same things as Airbus's existing one. So if Airbus wants to regain the upper hand in competition for sales to the giant Chinese market, it will likely have to step up its future Chinese production.</p> \n<h3>Loss of Export-Import Bank subsidies plays an indirect role</h3> \n<p>Lurking in the background of this story is the Export-Import Bank, a longstanding scheme to provide discounted loans to American manufacturers that vanished early this summer after sustained attacks from Tea Party Republicans. As the American economy has shifted away from manufacturing over the decades, airplanes have become a very large share of American manufacturing exports, and Boeing became the single biggest recipient of Export-Import Bank loans. On an elite level, the main source of lobbying against the bank was Delta, an airline that didn't like the idea of the US government subsidizing airline purchases for its foreign competitors.*</p> \n<p>The bank's disappearance will somewhat disadvantage Boeing in competition with Airbus for future contracts, because Europe retains its export financing subsidies. It also moderately reduces financial incentives for Boeing to keep its production in the United States.</p> \n<p>But the main relevance is <em>political</em>. The aerospace industry is highly politicized, due to both the heavy government role in regulating the airline industry and the linkages between commercial aircraft production and military aircraft production. Boeing's main competitor, Airbus, is partly owned by European governments, and its Chinese frenemy Comec is owned by the Chinese government. Government ownership isn't really done in America, but the Export-Import Bank — along with defense contracts — was one of the US government's main tools for supporting and influencing Boeing. With it gone, Boeing is more cut loose and more inclined to cut deals that advance China's long-term industrial aspirations rather than America's.</p> \n<p>* <i>Correction</i>: An earlier version of this article stated that Delta mostly flies Airbus planes. Delta does have a fleet of Airbus equipment inherited from its takeover of the former Northwest Airlines but a majority of its planes are made by Boeing.</p>",Business & Finance
The coming crackdown on click fraud is going to hurt your favorite indie website,http://www.vox.com/2015/9/24/9392523/click-fraud-big-publishers,"Ad networks make many small web publishers economically viable, but they're also vulnerable to click fraud.","<p>Bloomberg has a <a href=""http://www.bloomberg.com/features/2015-click-fraud/"">fantastic feature story</a> on the internet's epidemic of click fraud. Over the past decade, the internet's infrastructure for selling and displaying ads has become increasingly complex and increasingly automated. That, in turn, has created growing opportunities for scammy behavior.</p> \n<p>For example, companies create websites that humans hardly ever visit, at least on purpose, and then pay other companies to generate cheap, low-quality traffic to them. Sometimes traffic brokers use shady techniques like pop-under windows to trick users into opening a page. In other cases, the traffic is purely automated. The upshot is that advertisers wind up paying for ads that will never be seen by any human being.</p> \n<h3>Programmatic ad buying makes click fraud possible</h3> \n<p>This kind of scammy behavior is made possible by ad networks that automate the process of buying and selling ad space. Advertisers use ad networks because they want to reach large numbers of people and don't have time to negotiate deals with individual websites. But that also means they don't have time to carefully vet the websites that are showing their ads, leaving room for fraud.</p> \n<p>Of course, advertisers aren't stupid. They want their ads shown to human beings, not botnets, and over time they're going to be looking for better ways to combat ad fraud.</p> \n<h3>A decline in programmatic ads will benefit big publishers</h3> \n<p>One consequence of this is that larger websites — and media companies whose sites collectively reach a lot of people — are going to have a growing advantage over smaller, independent sites. Advertisers can be pretty sure that a well-known brand like the New York Times or BuzzFeed won't sell them fake traffic. So buying directly from publishers makes them less vulnerable to click fraud than buying through ad networks.</p> \n<p>But the people buying the ads only have so many hours in the day. So given a choice between buying from a few big publishers or a lot of smaller ones, they'd much rather deal with large publishers. Indeed, the convenience of one-stop shopping will likely allow larger publishers to charge a bit more per reader than smaller publishers can. This is a big reason why media organizations — <a href=""http://techcrunch.com/2015/08/12/nbcuniversal-backs-vox-media/"">including my employer</a>, Vox Media — are rushing to get bigger.</p> \n<p>And as Vox's Matt Yglesias wrote last week, the <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/9/18/9351759/ad-blocking-controversy"">growing popularity of ad blockers</a> is likely to push in the same direction. Ad blockers do the most damage to sites that rely on automated ad networks to sell ads for them. The largest media companies will be able to adapt by selling ads themselves and making them look more like legitimate content. Indeed, the largest publishers might even benefit from the reduced competition for ad dollars.</p> \n<p>This is likely to be a mixed blessing for readers. Obviously, it wouldn't be great for readers if a bunch of small, independent websites were forced out of business. On the other hand, consolidation in the media industry could ultimately raise the average quality of online journalism.</p> \n<p>Many readers complain about the internet's ""clickbait"" problem, where publications seem more focused on generating clicks than on delivering quality content to readers who do click. <span>Larger media companies that sell directly to advertisers have more reason to worry about the quality of the audience they're building, because they want repeat business and know advertisers hate clickbait as much as readers do. So if the advertising market drives consolidation in the media world, it could ultimately raise the average quality of online journalism.</span></p>",Business & Finance
This Bitcoin chip is supposed to be the future of micropayments. I'm skeptical.,http://www.vox.com/2015/9/26/9401309/21-bitcoin-computer-no,21 Inc. is the most lavishly funded Bitcoin startup ever. But its business plan has some big problems.,"<p>The 21 Bitcoin Computer, which was <a href=""http://www.coindesk.com/21-inc-bitcoin-computer-developers/"">unveiled this week</a>, is one of the most highly anticipated products in the Bitcoin world. The company behind it, 21 Inc., has <a href=""https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/21e6"">raised $120 million</a> from prominent investors like PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel and the well-known firm of Andreessen Horowitz. According to <a href=""http://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-venture-capital/"" target=""_blank"">this list</a> of Bitcoin investments, that makes it the most lavishly funded Bitcoin startup ever.</p> \n<p>So this week's announcement left a lot of people confused. For $399, you can get a tiny computer with a customized chip that allows you to generate bitcoins. An incredibly small quantity of bitcoins, in fact — according to one back-of-the-envelope calculation, it will <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/3lvo37/so21dropped_their_first_product_today_smart/cv9yp0w"">generate around 10 cents'</a> worth of bitcoin per day if run constantly. And depending on where you live, the electricity required to power the device could cost more than the value of the bitcoins generated.</p> \n<p><!--  ########  BEGIN SNIPPET  ########  --></p> \n<div data-analytics-category=""article"" data-analytics-action=""link:related"" class=""chorus-snippet s-related"">\n<span class=""s-related__title"">Related</span> <!-- Add links here --><a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/bitcoin/what-is-bitcoin"" target=""_blank"">Bitcoin, explained</a><br><!-- End links -->\n</div> \n<!--  ########  END SNIPPET  ########  --> \n<p><span>The backers of 21 believe that the ability to generate small quantities of bitcoins is going to become a standard component in digital devices — just as a wifi chip is today.  They envision a future where digital currency serves as a lubricant for a wide variety of electronic transactions that aren't possible with today's computers. If 21's technology works, it could deliver something technologists have dreamed about for decades: a practical system for paying for content and online services with tiny payments. For example, 21's technology could be used to power a jukebox that plays ad-free music, or a camera that automatically rents its own online storage.</span></p> \n<p>And 21 has built some impressive technology to help realize this vision. But the vision <span>itself</span><span> seems to have some gaping holes in it — holes so big that I'm skeptical 21's technology will take off.</span></p> \n<h3>21 is selling a chip to turn electricity into money</h3> \n<p>You've probably heard advertisements telling you to text to a certain number in order to make a $10 contribution to a particular charity. In this transaction, the phone company acts as the middleman, putting the $10 charge on your next monthly phone bill. That makes things more convenient for customers, who don't have to pull out a credit card at the time of donation — or worry that the credit card might get misused.</p> \n<p>The technical details of how the 21 Bitcoin Computer works is complicated, but at a basic level, you can think of it as a clever hack for putting charges onto your electricity bill. Inside the 21 Bitcoin Computer is a chip that can efficiently engage in ""mining"": performing difficult mathematical operations that can <a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/bitcoin/what-incentive-do-people-have-to-help-process-bitcoin-transactions"" target=""_blank"">generate new bitcoins</a>. These bitcoins have real financial value, but the process isn't free — the chip consumes a lot of power.</p> \n<p>The 21 Bitcoin Computer isn't designed for people who want to become professional Bitcoin miners — there are more sophisticated products for that already. Rather, 21 believes that the ability to generate a few pennies' worth of bitcoins per day will open up totally new types of markets that don't exist right now.</p> \n<h3>Imagine a jukebox that pays for its own songs</h3> \n<p>The device 21 is selling right now isn't the version of its technology that will eventually be offered to the general public. Instead, it's a proof of concept aimed at developers who — 21 hopes — will begin creating applications that use the 21 chip's capabilities. Over the next few years, they expect the chip will get smaller and dramatically cheaper, to the point where it can be built into a wide variety of third-party devices, much as chips from Intel are today.</p> \n<p><q class=""right"" aria-hidden=""true""><span>You can think of the 21 computer as a clever hack for putting charges onto your </span><span>electricity bill</span></q></p> \n<p>Imagine, for example, buying a small speaker that acts as an ad-free jukebox system. You plug it in, name any song, and the device starts playing it. And you never have to pull out a credit card. Instead, the jukebox is generating a fraction of a penny for each song it plays and sending it to the relevant copyright owner. Average consumers never have to think about it — or even understand how it works.</p> \n<p>Other 21-enabled products could work in a similar way. There could be a camera that automatically purchases enough online storage for the pictures and videos you take. There might be a tablet that automatically detects wifi networks that are willing to rent out anonymous access for a few pennies' worth of bitcoins. And maybe entrepreneurs can think of other clever ways to use small amounts of digital cash to make our lives more convenient.</p> \n<p>As the number of connected devices in our homes and offices grows, 21's technology could help avoid an orphan device problem. That's a situation where companies stop supporting these connected devices, leaving them in a broken or — even worse — insecure state. If each device is able to generate a small Bitcoin maintenance fee each month, it could provide manufacturers the funds they need to continue supporting devices long after they were created.</p> \n<h3>21 hopes to enable practical micropayments</h3> \n<p>At this point, you might be wondering why anyone would want to buy a weird money-printing chip instead of making payments through the regular financial system. There are two basic reasons.</p> \n<p>One is that for many applications it will be a hassle to input credit card information into a special-purpose device. The Bitcoin jukebox I mentioned in the previous section might not have a keyboard or screen, for example, and it would be convenient if you could just plug it in and have it start playing music.</p> \n<p>The more fundamental issue, though, is that the transaction fees of traditional financial networks make very small financial transactions impractical. The overhead of credit card networks means that the smaller transactions get, the larger the fraction that gets eaten up by fees. This is why you rarely see online goods that are cheaper than the 99-cent songs in the iTunes store. Below a dollar, the economics of credit card payments don't work very well.</p> \n<p>This is the real magic of 21's platform: The standard Bitcoin network isn't a great platform for micro payments either, but it's an open software platform. And 21 has apparently developed technology to use the Bitcoin network to make very small payments more efficiently than is possible with other payment technologies.</p> \n<h3>Why users probably won't like Bitcoin micropayments</h3> \n<p>Technologists have been dreaming of building practical micropayments for a very long time. There have been a number of attempts to build micropayment systems, and so far, none of these systems have really taken off. The investors behind 21 are making a big bet that Bitcoin is the technology that will finally make the concept work.</p> \n<p>People have been trying to make micropayments work for so long that the internet theorist Clay Shirky <a href=""http://www.openp2p.com/pub/a/p2p/2000/12/19/micropayments.html"">wrote an article</a> way back in 2000 explaining why the micropayment experiments of the dot-com boom hadn't taken off. More recently, as others have tackled the concept, he's written <a href=""http://www.shirky.com/writings/herecomeseverybody/fame_vs_fortune.html"">multiple</a> follow-up <a href=""http://www.shirky.com/weblog/2009/02/why-small-payments-wont-save-publishers/"">articles</a> on the topic since then.</p> \n<p>In a nutshell, Shirky's argument is that micropayment systems fail because users find them annoying. ""There is a certain amount of anxiety involved in any decision to buy, no matter how small, and it derives not from the interface used or the time required, but from the very act of deciding,"" he wrote. ""Micropayments, like all payments, require a comparison: 'Is this much of X worth that much of Y?' There is a minimum mental transaction cost created by this fact that cannot be optimized away.""</p> \n<p>On the surface, it might seem like 21's micropayment technology actually could optimize away these transaction costs. After all, when consumers buy new household appliances, they don't spend much time worrying about how much power they'll consume. Why should customers worry about a new generation of devices that take a bit of extra power and convert it into money?</p> \n<p>But if you think about how this would work in practice, it becomes clear that there would be some serious difficulties. Imagine a future where you have a dozen devices in your house with 21's bitcoin mining chip in them. One month, your electricity bill is suddenly $20 higher than you expected.</p> \n<p>Maybe it was just a hot month and your air conditioning was running on overtime. Maybe some of your 21-based devices got hacked, and bad guys are stealing your electricity to generate bitcoins for themselves. Maybe your teenage son recently bought a new off-brand device that generates a lot more bitcoins (and wastes a lot more power) than it promised on the box — and sends the extra cash back to its sketchy manufacturer.</p> \n<p><q class=""right"" aria-hidden=""true""><span>Devices with built-in bitcoin mining chips would have to be replaced every couple of years</span></q></p> \n<p>The problem is that you wouldn't know, and there would be no easy way to find out. It's not like your power bill will have an itemized list showing how much electricity each device is consuming. You'd be forced to start measuring the power consumption of the devices around your house — exactly the kind of accounting hassle 21's technology was supposed to eliminate.</p> \n<p>In practice, few people are going to want to worry about this kind of issue. It's only going to take a few stories of devices being hacked — or unscrupulous manufacturers overcharging customers — for customers to decide they want to steer clear of devices with built-in bitcoin mining chips.</p> \n<h3>21 chips will get less and less efficient</h3> \n<p>The 21 approach has another big problem, too: Bitcoin mining hardware tends to become obsolete quickly. All of the Bitcoin mining chips in the world compete to win a fixed pool of bitcoins. As new, more efficient chips come on the market, the number of bitcoins won by older, slower chips will go down over time.</p> \n<p>When you buy a shiny new 21-powered device, it might only cost 70 cents' worth of power to generate $1 worth of bitcoins. After a year, it might take $1.20 worth of power to generate $1 worth of bit coins. A year after that it might cost $2 to generate the same $1.</p> \n<p>So devices with built-in bitcoin mining chips would have to be replaced every couple of years to avoid having them waste more and more electricity.</p> \n<p>Of course, a device that only works for a couple of years could still be useful. But in that case, it might be more efficient to just load it with pre-generated bitcoins — or even better, just have the manufacturer provide the necessary services for free and charge an extra $10 or $20 for the device.

Here are my secrets.,http://www.vox.com/2015/10/5/9409017/hack-online-contest-win,Winning contests online is easy â€” if you know how to think like a contest planner.,"<p>You might think I'm pretty lucky. I've managed to score tickets to festivals, local shows, and six-course dinners. And I've even won not one but two bicycles in my life.</p> \n<p>My biggest contest-winning asset isn't luck — it's my experience advising companies that run contests. As a digital strategist, I've worked with clients that depended on contests to boost likes, comments, and follows on their social media accounts. And that has given me a road map for how contests work.</p> \n<p><!--  ########  BEGIN SNIPPET  ########  --></p> \n<div class=""chorus-snippet s-related"" data-analytics-action=""link:related"" data-analytics-category=""article"">\n<span class=""s-related__title"">Related</span> <!-- Add links here --><a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/10/30/7083499/you-should-be-saving-more"">Forget skipping coffee. Here's how to really save money.</a><br>\n</div> \n<p>Running contests is one of the many ways companies boost engagement with their brands. A book giveaway can translate to a couple thousands signups on an email list or more supporters using an event-specific hashtag. Tickets for a show, easy to come by and ship out to a fan, can net companies hard-earned social currency.</p> \n<p>Contest results aren't necessarily random — and if you understand how they work, you can boost your chances of winning.</p> \n<p>Here are six rules I follow:</p> \n<h3>1) Think like a contest planner</h3> \n<p>Say you have a brand to promote and a big pile of something — like concert tickets or band merchandise — to give away. Your goal is to use the giveaway to get the brand in front of as many people as possible, generating the maximum number of entrants.</p> \n<p>For brands that are still building a social media following, that's not easy. The number of initial followers who hear about the contest might be pretty low, and the number of entrants even lower.</p> \n<p>That's a big problem for the social media manager. But it's an opportunity for fans, because it means that you have a pretty good chance of winning the prize — if you play your cards right.</p> \n<h3>2) Exploit social media, email lists, and hashtags</h3> \n<p>Your first step is to identify businesses, venues, or tourism boards to follow. Ideally, these will be in your local area, because who wants to win a prize you can't redeem?</p> \n<ul> \n<li>For email, you just have to sign up with companies whose products you like, and contest opportunities will start pouring into your inbox. You can easily filter these using typical contest language like ""enter to win.""</li> \n<li>If you're on Facebook, have a list of local accounts you check in on regularly, especially if you see a record of them posting contests on a regular schedule.</li> \n<li>On Twitter, you may be able to find lists of businesses or influential accounts that you can follow in columns using apps like <a href=""https://tweetdeck.twitter.com/"">Tweetdeck</a> or <a href=""https://hootsuite.com/"">Hootsuite</a>. Twitter also has a handy geotagging feature that lets you see tweets within a set radius of your location. Using Tweetdeck or an <a href=""https://twitter.com/search-advanced"">advanced Twitter search</a>, you can <a href=""https://dev.twitter.com/rest/reference/get/search/tweets"">run a radius search to find these local tweets</a>. (For example, you can search <em>near:""Washington DC"" within:15mi </em>in Tweetdeck or a Twitter search box.) Keep these in a separate column you can glance at over the course of the week.</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>3) Set up smart searches for contests you might actually care about</h3> \n<p>You might be following some promising accounts, but there's still a chance you'll miss opportunities amid all the online noise. To avoid this, you can set up pings for keywords that will help filter your tweets and emails. When running a search in Tweetdeck, I generally include terms such as ""giveaway,"" ""RT to win,"" or ""win tickets"" that are most likely to be included in a social media manager's promotion message. You could also specify a target item, whether it's a newly released book, travel, or electronics.</p> \n<p>For example, in Tweetdeck you could search for <i>""RT to win"" OR ""win tickets"" OR ""win tix.""</i><em> </em>You can also run this a search for these keywords in the ""any of these words"" row of <a href=""https://twitter.com/search-advanced"">the advanced Twitter search</a>.</p> \n<p>Some contest enthusiasts have taken <a href=""http://gizmodo.com/i-wrote-a-bot-that-won-twitter-contests-1722126436"">automating their entries to the next level</a>, with bots that automatically retweet or enter anything with a contest ask, but I like to keep my criteria simple.</p> \n<p>Once I've grown a significant pool of contests to choose from, I can get pretty selective about which ones to enter, focusing on my favorite musical acts or prizes I might actually use. I usually don't spend more than five minutes checking in on any of my given lists, and once I'm done I can just wait for a friendly social media ping or mention to inform me if anything has come of it.</p> \n<p><q class=""center"" aria-hidden=""true"">Take advantage of filtering technologies, such as Google's promotions tab or Tweetdeck's filters</q></p> \n<h3>4) Consider creating separate, contest-specific accounts</h3> \n<p>At this point, you're probably wondering if this means you're going to wind up getting a lot of spam or, even worse, wind up forcing contest spam on your social media contacts. If that prospect makes you queasy, there are several options.</p> \n<p>One is to create separate accounts that you use only for contests. You might only check these once or twice a day — often enough to see new announcements but not so often that it drives you crazy.</p> \n<p>You can also take advantage of filtering technologies, such as Google's promotions tab or Tweetdeck's filters, to filter out contest-related content from your primary account.</p> \n<p>For email promotions, you can also add +promotions to your email address (example+promotions@gmail.com) as you type it into a signup form; then you can run a filter on all incoming emails with the appended keyword.</p> \n<p>In some cases, you might also decide to use your ""real"" accounts. This might be annoying for you and your friends, but in some cases it might be worth it, because (as we'll see) contest promoters are more likely to choose winners with an active social media presence and more online followers.</p> \n<h3>5) Be the kind of person who gets picked</h3> \n<p>While some contest managers will pick a randomly selected winner, all too often the winner will be preselected and (as in the case of those ""Dinners With Barack"") heavily vetted.</p> \n<p>Contest managers want a winner who promotes the brand, is excited, and will spread the word to his or her followers after winning. For social media contests especially, there's a big benefit to choosing a winner who has a decent personal following. Often the rules favor those who best represent the brand by meeting some arbitrary criteria for the ""best"" comment or entry.</p> \n<p>This is one reason using your real accounts might give you a better chance of winning than using a secondary account. And at the end of the day, actually sounding excited about a contest will probably help you get picked, or at the very least make you a much more appealing prospect for a contest down the line.</p> \n<h3>6) Bet big on openings, first-time festivals, or up-and-coming acts</h3> \n<p>Music is an area where savvy contest entrants can really shine. Following local venues, artists coming to town, or first-time festivals reaps the easiest rewards. Promoters are eager to fill up shows, and throwing a contest is an easy way to get buzz for the band or venue. Plus, a contest winner might be likely to get a few more friends to tag along or spend money at the venue on alcohol or promotional items, a win-win for everyone involved.</p> \n<p>Bands and authors will also likely count on the types of swag that are easiest for them to distribute, from digital downloads of books or music to signed hard copies and merchandise. Just make sure it's something you'd actually want to own.</p> \n<h2></h2> \n<hr> \n<!--  ########  BEGIN VOLUME VIDEO  ########  --> \n<div data-analytics-viewport=""video"" data-analytics-action=""volume:view:article:middle"" data-analytics-label=""It's not you.

Here's why your bank probably just sent you a new credit and debit card,http://www.vox.com/2015/9/29/9415325/emv-credit-debit,"Thursday is the deadline for switching to a new, more secure way to make credit card payments.","<p>For decades, Americans have been paying for things by swiping the magnetic strip on their credit cards through an electronic card reader. But that's about to change. Today, October 1, is the official deadline to switch to a new, more sophisticated payment technology that replaces that magnetic strip on the back of your credit card with a tiny computer chip. If you have one or more credit or debit cards, you probably got replacements recently that looked like this:</p> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""4106786""><img src=""https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4106786/shutterstock_181725995.jpg""></div> \n<p>On the left-hand side of the picture, you can see metal contacts that allow a card reader to communicate with a tiny computer chip embedded in the card. This chip is capable of authenticating financial transactions in a way that's much more fraud-resistant than the old-fashioned magnetic strip.</p> \n<p>From the user's perspective, the change will be a fairly minor one: Instead of swiping the card through a reader, you'll slide it into a slot and leave it there for several seconds. But behind the scenes, the switch could produce a dramatic reduction in credit card fraud.</p> \n<h3>America's credit card networks are old and busted</h3> \n<p>In the past few years, US retailers have suffered from a seemingly endless series of security breaches that led to the loss of customers' credit card information. A big reason for this is that our technology for processing credit card transactions — specifically, the magnetic strip on the back of the card — is decades out of date.</p> \n<p>That magnetic strip contains a machine-readable version of the <a href=""https://support.authorize.net/authkb/index?page=content&amp;id=A755"">same information</a> that's printed on the card itself: the account number, account holder's name, and the card expiration date. The credit card terminal uses this information to contact the bank that issued the credit card and verify that the card is valid.</p> \n<p>The key thing to notice about this scheme is that it effectively works on the honor system. Your account number and expiration date work as a de facto password for your account, and you share that ""password"" every time you buy something.</p> \n<p>This works surprisingly well because the overwhelming majority of merchants have no interest in defrauding their customers. But if the information falls into the wrong hands — say, because hackers infiltrate a major retailer like <a href=""http://money.cnn.com/2015/03/19/technology/security/target-data-hack-settlement/"">Target</a> or <a href=""http://www.wsj.com/articles/home-depot-hackers-used-password-stolen-from-vendor-1415309282"">Home Depot</a> — then exploiting it is easy. Criminals simply have to copy the information onto a new credit card, then hire people to <a href=""http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/part-of-multimillion-dollar-credit-fraud-broken-here-officials-say/article_41c4b9d0-4add-5cfb-ad53-7a3fcfeb752f.html"">go on shopping sprees</a> with the new cards, buying valuable items like iPads and designer handbags that can be unloaded at a profit later.</p> \n<p>This might be why the United States suffers disproportionately from credit card fraud. In 2013, <a href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/the-us-accounts-for-over-half-of-global-payment-card-fraud-sai-2014-3"">the US accounted</a> for 23 percent of all credit card transactions but 47 percent of credit card fraud.</p> \n<h3>The rest of the world is way ahead of us</h3> \n<p>This problem has been obvious for decades, and indeed the financial industry figured out how to solve it decades ago. The solution: Replace that magnetic strip with a tiny computer chip that is capable of <a href=""http://www.cryptomathic.com/hubfs/docs/cryptomathic_white_paper-emv_key_management.pdf"">authenticating itself in a more sophisticated way</a>. The chip card can prove it's legitimate without supplying enough information for a criminal to clone the card.</p> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""4106700""><img src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4106700/EMVCo_WorldMap.png""></div> \n<p>The global standard for doing this is called EMV, after the Europay, <span>MasterCard</span>, and Visa networks that developed it. The EMV standard was developed in the early 1990s, and most of the developed world has been using the technology for years. In Europe, chip-based credit card transactions accounted for 96 percent of transactions in late 2014, compared with less than 1 percent in the United States. Latin America, Asia, and even Africa are ahead of the US in adopting the technology.</p> \n<h3>Upgrading is a big project</h3> \n<p>The transition has been so slow because switching to a new payment system requires simultaneous upgrades by many different parties. Banks have to send out new credit cards. Retailers have to upgrade to new equipment. If banks upgrade and merchants don't — or vice versa — the investments will be wasted.</p> \n<p>And these upgrades are expensive. New chip cards cost as much as $4, compared with less than 50 cents for old-fashioned magnetic strip cards. New card readers can cost hundreds of dollars, compared with less than $100 for the old ones.</p> \n<p>To prevent companies from dragging their feet, major American payment networks set a hard deadline — October 1, 2015 — for switching to chip card technology. Starting today, they're going to change credit card liability rules to give merchants and card-issuing banks an incentive to switch. Right now, merchants and card-issuing banks split liability for credit card fraud. But if a fraudulent transaction occurs after October 1, liability will fall more heavily on companies that haven't upgraded to the new technology.</p> \n<p>This is why you may have gotten a bunch of replacement credit cards in the mail in recent weeks. By upgrading promptly to the new technology, major banks can not only reduce fraud, but can also shift liability for fraud that does occur onto merchants.</p> \n<p>Retailers — especially smaller ones — have been slower to make the switch. But starting today, they'll have powerful incentives to do so.</p> \n<h3>The new standards will reduce fraud but won't eliminate it</h3> \n<p>The switch to chip-based credit cards will dramatically reduce one specific type of credit card — the kind where criminals steal the data off the magnetic strip and use it to make a new, fraudulent card.</p> \n<p>The fact that the United States is the last major economy to switch to chip-based cards means that we're likely to see the benefits more quickly than other countries did. When other countries switched to EMV cards, criminals responded by cloning cards and using them in countries, including the United States, that hadn't yet made the switch. But once the US transition is complete, criminals won't have anywhere else to turn.</p> \n<p>However, two other major avenues for credit card fraud will remain open.</p> \n<p>One is to steal the cards themselves. A purse snatcher will still be able to take a stolen credit card and go on a shopping spree. Some other countries have adopted an approach called chip-and-PIN, which requires customers to enter a four-digit PIN to authenticate transactions. But most US credit card companies have adopted a less secure chip-and-signature approach that provides no real protection for stolen credit cards (debit cards are more likely to require a PIN to make payments).</p> \n<p>The even harder problem is remote transactions. A chip only helps with face-to-face transactions. Online orders will still work by typing in a customer's credit card number and other details, which means it will still be possible for bad guys to steal a customer's credit card information and then make fraudulent transactions online.</p> \n<p>Credit card companies have tried a wide variety of ways to beef up the security of online transactions. All three credit card networks have experimented with systems where users are redirected to a third-party website to prove their identity before a transaction is approved. But the process is glitchy, and users hate the extra hassle, so it hasn't caught on.</p>",Business & Finance
CEOs say gender diversity is a priority. That's news to the women who work forÂ them.,http://www.vox.com/2015/9/30/9422977/gender-diversity-priority,It's hard to make change happen when leaders think it already has.,"<p>A new McKinsey report done in partnership with Sheryl Sandberg's group Lean In sheds light on a number of obstacles women face when trying to advance up the corporate ladder. Much of it is about what you might expect, but a particularly insidious obstacle is arguably a form of self-deception in which companies say that gender diversity is a priority but don't act like it.</p> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""4110810""><img src=""https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4110810/Screen%20Shot%202015-09-30%20at%2010.05.36%20AM.png""></div> \n<p>This chart shows that nearly three-quarters of companies officially state that their CEO prioritizes gender diversity in his (or her, but really it's almost always his) decision-making. About half of men say they think this is true, but only about a third of women (who would be in a position to know) agree. And of course real priorities filter down to middle managers, who know they need to adopt the CEO's priorities in order to get ahead. And when it comes to their direct supervisors, men and women both overwhelmingly agree that gender diversity isn't a priority.</p> \n<p>The result is a dynamic that's incredibly resistant to change. Companies aren't going to do things differently unless CEOs make it a priority, but you can't even get a discussion going about making something a priority when the CEO is invested in saying it already is.</p>",Business & Finance
Tesla's Model X SUV is ludicrously fast and ludicrously expensive,http://www.vox.com/2015/9/30/9428011/tesla-model-x-explained,"The latest Tesla supercar features ""falcon-wing doors"" and advanced safety features.","<p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk introduced the company's latest supercar on Tuesday: the Model X. It's an all-electric SUV that accelerates like a sports car.</p> \n<p>Musk spent a lot of time touting the safety features of the Model X, arguing that it has dramatically better crash safety than competing SUVs. Advanced sensors and software can detect an impending crash and automatically apply the brakes. And Musk says the car has the industry's best air filters, including a ""bioweapon defense mode"" to prevent bacteria, viruses, pollen, and other pollutants from entering the vehicle.</p> \n<p>The most visible innovation in the Model X is the falcon-wing doors. Instead of swinging outward as they do on most SUVs, the rear passenger doors on the Model X swing upward.</p> \n<p>But before you get too excited, the Model X has sports car pricing to go with its sports car acceleration. On Tuesday, Musk unveiled a 90D model for $132,000, a P90D model with a ""Ludicrous Speed"" acceleration mode for $142,000. A <a href=""https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/649130149036687360"" target=""_blank"">tweet from Musk</a> indicates that ""lower cost versions"" are ""coming later.""</p> \n<p>Tesla will be targeting the same class of wealthy customers that bought the company's previous models, the Roadster and the Model S. If you want to own a Tesla car and you're not rich, you'll likely need to wait until 2017. That's when Tesla claims it will release the Model 3, an electric car that normal people will be able to afford.</p> \n<h3>Electric motors provide unique advantages</h3> \n<p> </p> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""4112650"" alt=""tesla-model-x-launch-007-2040.0.0.jpg"" src=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4112650/tesla-model-x-launch-007-2040.0.0.jpg""></p> \n<p> </p> \n<p class=""caption"">(The Verge)</p> \n<p> </p> \n<p>Major car companies like Ford, GM, and Toyota build their vehicles around gasoline-powered engines. Tesla cars are built around batteries and electric motors. And that gives Tesla unique advantages — and a few big disadvantages.</p> \n<p>The biggest downside is that batteries are expensive, and you need a lot of them to get reasonable range and performance. The Model X can go an impressive 250 miles on a single charge. But the batteries required to deliver that kind of range are a big reason the car is so expensive. Tesla is investing billions of dollars in a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gigafactory_1"">Nevada battery factory</a> in hopes of bringing these costs down.</p> \n<p>Driving an electric-only vehicle also means you need a network of electric charging stations to enable people to make long trips — a network Tesla is slowly building. Tesla claims its superchargers can provide the Model S enough charge for 170 miles of driving in as little as 30 minutes — a figure that should be similar for the Model X.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""right""><span>The electric motors in the Model X are so small that they leave room for a trunk in the front</span></q></p> \n<p>But all-electric design also has some huge advantages. Gasoline engines are complex and heavy, and they take up a lot of space. Using smaller and lighter electric motors has allowed Tesla to rethink how to use the space inside a car.</p> \n<p>For example, the electric motors in the Model X are so small that they leave room for a trunk in the front of the vehicle where the engine would be in a conventional car. That not only provides more room for groceries, Musk says, it's also a safety feature.</p> \n<p>In a head-on collision involving a conventional car, the engine gets pushed back toward the passenger compartment, increasing the risk that the driver's legs get crushed. The trunk space at the front of the Model X provides a larger crumple zone to absorb the impact of a front-end collision, increasing the chances that a passenger will avoid injury.</p> \n<p>The batteries that power the vehicle are mounted under the floor of the vehicle. This gives the vehicle a low center of mass, reducing the risk of rollovers.</p> \n<p>Finally, the electric motors provide great performance. Gas-powered engines have to shift gears to maintain maximum acceleration, but Tesla says the electric motors in the Model X can smoothly and rapidly accelerate from 0 to 60 miles per hour in 3.2 to 3.8 seconds, depending on the specific model.</p> \n<h3>The Model X has ""falcon-wing doors"" that look cool and might even be useful</h3> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""4112628"" alt=""tesla-model-x-launch-004-2040.0.0.jpg"" src=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4112628/tesla-model-x-launch-004-2040.0.0.jpg""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">(The Verge)</p> \n<p>Unlike normal car doors that swing out to the side, the rear passenger doors on the Model X swing up. In the past, this kind of door has had a big problem: If there's an obstacle next to the car — like another car — it can block the door from opening.</p> \n<p>Tesla solved this problem by adding an extra set of hinges to the middle of the doors. That allows the doors to swing upward without swinging out very far:</p> \n<p><iframe frameborder=""0"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vox78WUVtd8"" height=""480"" width=""853""></iframe></p> \n<p>Of course, this approach could lead to another problem: the doors hitting the ceiling if the car is parked in a garage. To avoid that, the car is equipped with sensors that measure the distance to surrounding objects. It automatically adjusts the path of the doors to avoid hitting objects either beside or above the vehicle.</p> \n<p>The front driver's door also has a convenient innovation: It detects the driver's approach and opens automatically. Then when the driver steps on the brake, the driver's side door starts to close.</p> \n<h3>The Model X has a ""bioweapon defense mode"" and a panoramic windshield</h3> \n<p>Musk made a big deal about the air filters in the Model X. He says that standard cars have relatively small conventional filters — around a foot square — for taking in air from outside. The Model X has a more advanced HEPA air filter that can catch particles conventional air filters can't catch. However, HEPA filters work best when air flows through them slowly, so the air filters in the Model X are dramatically bigger than those in other cars.</p> \n<p>Musk claims that the larger filter, along with advanced filtering materials, allows the interior of the car to be as sterile as a hospital operating room. The car even has a ""bioweapon defense mode"" that creates a slightly higher air pressure inside the car, ensuring that no outside air can seep into the vehicle.</p> \n<p>The Model X also has one of the industry's biggest windshields, stretching up over the head of the driver and front-seat passenger, allowing them to look up at the sky as the car drives down the road. Musk claims this more expansive view can help people who are <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/8/9/9121583/motion-sickness-carsick"" target=""_blank"">prone to carsickness</a>.</p> \n<h3>The Model X is a car for rich people</h3> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""4112642"" alt=""tesla-model-x-launch-015-2040.0.0.jpg"" src=""https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4112642/tesla-model-x-launch-015-2040.0.0.jpg""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">(The Verge)</p> \n<p>Overall, the Model X sounds like a great product. But don't expect to see a lot of them on the roads any time soon.</p> \n<p>Tesla's stated business strategy is to start at the high end of the market and work its way down. Its first two cars were the Roadster, an electric sports car that cost more than $100,000, and the Model S, a luxury sedan that could easily cost more than $100,000 with all the bells and whistles.</p> \n<p>The Model X has a more family-friendly design, but the $132,000 price tag on the first model makes it no more accessible to ordinary families than other Tesla cars.</p> \n<p>Musk has signaled that later versions of the Model X will be more affordable. In a <a href=""https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/649130149036687360"" target=""_blank"">tweet</a>, he pointed out that Model X versions cost $5,000 more than corresponding Model S versions. The cheapest Model S versions cost $70,000, suggesting that Tesla could eventually offer a version of the Model X for $75,000.</p> \n<p>Of course, that's still a lot of money. Tesla<span> has only sold around 80,000 Model S vehicles in the life of the product. </span><span>And that's a problem because economies of scale are crucial to making profits in the car business. Musk has said that </span><a href=""http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-08-10/here-s-how-elon-musk-takes-tesla-to-500-000-cars-in-five-years"" target=""_blank"">Tesla needs to sell 500,000 vehicles a year</a><span> by 2020</span><span> to turn a profit, and right now the company is nowhere near that goal.</span></p> \n<p>Supposedly, that will change in 2017, when Tesla plans to release the Model 3 with a much more accessible price tag of around $35,000. (Musk wanted to call it the Model E, so his three car models spelled S-E-X, but that plan ran into <a href=""http://fortune.com/2014/05/07/tesla-drops-model-e-trademark-but-ford-hangs-on/"">trademark problems</a>). But given Musk's a reputation for <a href=""http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-08-05/elon-musk-has-a-production-problem"">missing deadlines</a>, ordinary consumers might have to wait even longer to join the electric vehicle party.</p> \n<!-- CHORUS_VIDEO_EMBED ChorusVideo:78776 -->",Business & Finance

Today the Labor Department released new statistics showing that just 5.1 percent of Americans are unemployed. That's unchanged from the previous month and down from more than 10 percent in the depths of the last recession.</p> \n<p>But the unemployment rate tells an incomplete story about the state of the labor market. It counts the number of people who are out actively looking for work and not finding it. But it does not include people who — for whatever reason — are not looking for work at all.</p> \n<p>But another statistic, the labor force participation rate, gives a comprehensive sense for how many people are working. It shows the fraction of the population over age 16 that is working. And today we learned that this statistic fell to 62.4 percent — the lowest level since 1977.</p> \n<p>One big factor driving this trend is that the American population is getting older, and older workers are less likely to be in the workforce. At the same time, the share of ""prime age"" adults — those between 25 and 54 — in the workforce <a href=""https://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/graph/?g=20DD"" target=""_blank"">has also been falling</a> since the late 1990s.</p> \n<p>The declining labor force participation represents a long-term trend that goes beyond the most recent recession. The LFPR rose in the 1970s and '80s because a lot of women were entering the workforce. But that trend has run its course, and as the US becomes a wealthier and older society, fewer and fewer of us are employed.</p>",Business & Finance
"Tesla has a strategy car incumbents can't beat, but they may be too slow",http://www.vox.com/2015/10/3/9441089/tesla-price-strategy,Disruption from above.,"<p>Tesla Motors is following up its well-reviewed, ridiculously expensive Model S by releasing the Model X, an all-electric SUV that is … even more expensive, with vehicles starting at a mind-blowing $132,000. This isn't an <gs class=""GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark"" ginger_software_uiphraseguid=""419a0677-f6f7-4c13-b81b-5b6a7fb6ac79"" id=""626a6f6f-5817-4444-87cb-4ca1dfec6b01"">unprecedentedly</gs> high price for a car, but even luxury automakers like BMW and Mercedes offer entry-level products for a quarter the price of a Model X.</p> \n<p>Musk is, of course, aware that his vehicles are far too expensive to be mass-market successes. He has <a href=""https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/649130149036687360"">signaled</a> that cheaper versions of the Model X will be ""coming later,"" and promises that by 2017 there will be a car — the Model 3 — in the $35,000 range. But Tesla has missed deadlines before, so there is some reason to doubt that it will be able to deliver on that target.</p> \n<p>But even more, the whole idea of starting with an incredibly expensive, incredibly high-end product flies in the face of a lot of emerging conventional wisdom about the process of technological disruption and the desirability of shipping ""minimum viable products"" that improve iteratively over time.</p> \n<p>Yet there's a method to the madness. In some ways, the actual car is the least of the obstacles to creating a mass-market electric car.

Where would you refuel?</p> \n<p>In the real world, of course, the shoe is on the other foot: People with conventional cars can easily find a gas station, while electric car charging stations are few and far between.</p> \n<p>Regardless of the price of gas, the volume of subsidy, or one's personal commitment to the <gs class=""GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark"" ginger_software_uiphraseguid=""a4cb131b-d43d-405e-8845-4c8e0f458293"" id=""a284e07a-5b80-47d1-bd96-60b2030e8616"">environment, it</gs> just makes an awful lot of practical sense to buy a car that uses the same fuel as everyone else's car. <gs class=""GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark"" ginger_software_uiphraseguid=""3274b8f5-57c0-4444-afbb-49410c42e531"" id=""d7e9fc79-0f14-42b2-897a-4344549b5518"">Tesla</gs> is aware of this and has a solution in the form of a <a href=""http://www.teslamotors.com/supercharger"">growing network of ""Supercharger"" stations</a> that, when complete, would make electric cars a reasonable thing for a typical family to consider.</p> \n<p>The Model S (and Model X) <gs class=""GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark"" ginger_software_uiphraseguid=""493a327f-b4ad-4128-b940-71026c61c373"" id=""0ef64d43-3f47-4a57-bebe-2411f5055393"">is priced</gs> to appeal to people who don't need to worry too much about the practical aspects of car ownership.

Companies that are already making money selling internal combustion engines aren't going to invest in a broad infrastructure that would make gasoline obsolete. Nor are they going to attempt to engineer a manufacturing breakthrough that would have the same impact.</p> \n<p>The incumbents aren't dumb. They can (and do) make electric cars. But they make EVs that are designed to live in a world dominated by conventional cars — semi-affordable small cars useful for daily local driving by people with an eccentric interest in green living.</p> \n<p>By contrast, Tesla, by simply accepting the reality that its early cars will be too expensive for the vast majority of people to even consider, has achieved something really impressive: near-universal acclaim for the quality of its products, including <a href=""http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-08-27/tesla-with-insane-mode-busts-curve-on-consumer-reports-ratings-idu1hfk0"">a determination from Consumer Reports that the P85 D variant of the Model S is so good that it broke the quality scale</a>.* This is a kind of free marketing campaign for the eventual Model 3 that money can't buy.</p> \n<h3>Tesla's Achilles heel is speed</h3> \n<p>The strategy of starting from the top and then working down, though alien to the software-heavy business models that dominate the startup sector these days, makes perfect sense for the infrastructure-intense car industry. The real risk for Tesla is that its roadmap may be unfolding too slowly. The Model X was originally supposed to have shipped in 2013, and even with delivery of preordered vehicles beginning this week it doesn't think <em>new</em> orders will be fulfilled until the back half of 2016. In other words, Tesla is evidently facing significant production bottlenecks that make it difficult for the company to make cars in large quantities.</p> \n<p>That's another good reason for the company to charge high prices, but it adds up to significant reason to doubt that it will really have a mass-market Model 3 ready in 2017. Tesla would need to develop the car, obviously, which is difficult. But it would also need to develop a process by which the cars can actually roll off assembly lines at mass scale. There's no point in selling a car that normal people would consider buying if you can't actually get them built.</p> \n<p>This isn't a huge problem if you view the competitive set as legacy carmakers. A year or three, more or less, doesn't really change anything.</p> \n<p>The problem is that other new entrants could attempt a similar strategy, and despite Tesla's years-long lead, the company's slow pace of execution means they're not un-catchable. Companies like Google and Apple that are known to be interested in the car market have much more free cash flow available from their existing businesses than Tesla can obtain by selling high-end cars. <em>If</em> they can manage to build a good car (admittedly a big if), then these companies have the ability to leapfrog Tesla in terms of capital investments in manufacturing and vehicle charging facilities with ease. To stave off <em>that</em> kind of competition, Tesla needs to rely on its actual expertise in building cars. And so far even though the cars it's built have been extremely well-regarded, it hasn't actually demonstrated the ability to make them at the kind of scale that a successful car company needs.</p> \n<hr> \n<p><b>Correction:</b> An earlier version of this article said it was the Model X, rather than the P85D, that broke Consumer Reports' quality ratings scale.</p>",Business & Finance
"Why Peeple, the ""Yelp for people,"" shouldn't freak you out",http://www.vox.com/2015/10/2/9441781/peeple-explained,"A new app lets you rate your friends, acquaintances, and romantic partners. Critics are calling it terrifying.","<p>The Washington Post calls it <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2015/09/30/everyone-you-know-will-be-able-to-rate-you-on-the-terrifying-yelp-for-people-whether-you-want-them-to-or-not/"" target=""_blank"">""terrifying.""</a> Dubbed ""Yelp for people,"" Peeple is a new app that lets people rate their friends, professional contacts, and even romantic partners. And everyone is freaking out.</p> \n<p>But there's not actually much reason to be terrified of Peeple. Yes, the app is a bad idea. But it's not really a <em>new</em> bad idea. It's an idea that entrepreneurs have repeatedly tried and failed to make work. It turns out that people aren't as interested in publicly burning their ex-lovers and friends as Peeple thinks they are. And even if some people do want to publicly trash their acquaintances, Peeple has promised safeguards that will make that hard to do.</p> \n<p>You're only hearing about Peeple because it sounds like such an outrageously bad idea that people love denouncing it. But that's not the foundation of a successful business. In a few days, the internet will move on to being outraged about something else, and Peeple — which won't even become available until November — is likely to sink back into obscurity.</p> \n<h3>What is Peeple?</h3> \n<p>Peeple is a forthcoming smartphone app that will allow people to rate anyone they know, whether or not the subjects want to be reviewed. Founded by Canadian entrepreneurs Julia Cordray and Nicole McCullough, the company behind Peeple says it has already <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLDNmDtokrk"">raised $250,000</a> in funding.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""center""><span>You're only hearing about Peeple because it sounds like such an outrageously bad idea</span></q></p> \n<p>The service is designed to cover all aspects of people's lives. You can use it to rate professional contacts, friends, and romantic relationships.</p> \n<p>Peeple says it will take a number of precautions to prevent the service from becoming a cesspool of nasty reviews. Reviewers will be required to use their real identities as verified by Facebook, and new Facebook profiles won't be allowed to participate.</p> \n<p>Positive reviews of another person — those rated three or more stars on a five-star scale — will be posted immediately, but negative reviews will be held until the subject has time to review them. If someone refuses to register for the site, those negative reviews will be kept private indefinitely.</p> \n<p>So the emerging caricature of Peeple as an app for stalkers and disgruntled exes may turn out to be wrong. It may actually be harder to harass people on Peeple than on existing social media platforms.</p> \n<h3>How have people reacted to Peeple?</h3> \n<p>The reaction has been swift and overwhelmingly negative. Across the internet, people have condemned the app as an invasion of privacy and an invitation to online harassment. So many people are angry about Peeple that the app recently became a trending topic on social media sites.</p> \n<p>The backlash has been so intense that Peeple has been trying to play damage control. ""We hear you loud and clear,"" <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/peeptheapp/posts/1054670341233983?comment_id=1054679837899700&amp;offset=0&amp;total_comments=535&amp;comment_tracking=%7B%22tn%22%3A%22R9%22%7D"">the company said</a> in a Thursday Facebook post.

""People reviewing other people for their personal behavior is a perennial topic.""</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""right""><span>The reaction has been swift and overwhelmingly negative</span></q></p> \n<p>He pointed to <a href=""https://www.playerblock.com/"">PlayerBlock</a> and <a href=""http://www.dontdatehimgirl.com/"">Don't Date Him Girl</a> as examples. Both are sites that allow women to rate the men they date, with an eye to filtering out ""players"" who cheat on their partners.</p> \n<p>When PlayerBlock was released in 2007, it got a reception much like the one Peeple is getting now. ""I for one think that such a service is a disgusting invasion of privacy,"" one reviewer <a href=""http://www.uberreview.com/2007/10/playerblock-service-restricts-a-players-right-to-play.htm"">wrote</a>. ""The potential for abuse of such a system is enormous.""</p> \n<p>Lulu is another app with the same premise: helping users — mostly women — review people they've dated. The app <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/21/fashion/social-networking-App-allows-women-to-rate-men.html?_r=0"">got a writeup</a> from the New York Times in 2013.</p> \n<p>Perhaps the closest analogy is Unvarnished, an app that was released in 2010. An <a href=""http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/technology/2010/03/unvarnished-a-new-website-that-rates-people-triggers-controversy.html"">LA Times writeup</a> even used the same ""Yelp for people"" framing that's been used for Peeple. Unlike Peeple, Unvarnished allowed reviews to be posted anonymously.</p> \n<h3>Is it legal to run a service like Peeple?</h3> \n<p>A number of armchair attorneys have warned Peeple's founders that they're opening themselves up to liability. But Goldman says that — at least under US law — the company has nothing to worry about.</p> \n<p>The reason, ironically, is the Communications Decency Act. Most of this controversial 1996 internet censorship law was struck down by the Supreme Court, but the courts left in place Section 230, which gives broad immunity to website operators hosting user-submitted information. ""This is clearly governed by Section 230,"" Goldman says.</p> \n<p>If someone posts defamatory information about another person online, the poster could face liability under libel laws. But Section 230 shields an online service like Peeple from any liability, even if the posts are ultimately found to be defamatory.</p> \n<h3>Does Peeple the app have anything to do with Peeple the keyhole gadget?</h3> \n<p>No, and the other company is pretty frustrated about it.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""right""><span>There's reason to be skeptical that Peeple will get very far</span></q></p> \n<p>Peeple is a small camera that can be mounted to the keyhole in your front door. It has a built-in wifi chip, allowing you to check out who is standing at your front door with your smartphone, no matter where you are.</p> \n<p>There's no connection between the two companies, but the tsunami of outrage surrounding the Yelp-for-people app has engulfed the gadget company too.</p> \n<p>""This was supposed to be our moment in the sun,"" the gadget company's founder <a href=""http://www.wired.com/2015/10/peeple-the-thing-versus-peeple-the-app/"">told Wired</a>. ""We just won a major competition … then this happened yesterday and completely swallowed up our press. Our branding is in tatters.""</p> \n<h3>Should I be worried about my name showing up on Peeple?</h3> \n<p>We won't know how popular Peeple will be until the app's launch, which is scheduled for November. But there's reason to be skeptical that it will get very far.</p> \n<p>For one thing, you probably hadn't heard of the other people-rating services I mentioned earlier in this article. This is an idea that has been tried before, and it's never really worked.</p> \n<p>And the furious reaction helps explain why. People find Peeple, and other apps like it, creepy. They have a strong intuition that rating friends and romantic partners is different from rating businesses. Given that Peeple will require users to attach their real names to reviews, most people will be reluctant to participate.</p> \n<p>Yelp works because customers and businesses have an arms-length relationship. Most people aren't friends with the owners of businesses they patronize; they don't have to worry that leaving a negative review will later lead to awkward encounters at social events. So while Yelp has caught on, there's no reason to think that many people want to use a ""Yelp for people.""</p>",Business & Finance
"The just-completed Trans-Pacific Partnership deal, explained",http://www.vox.com/2015/10/5/9456757/trans-pacific-partnership-explained,A compromise over pharmaceuticals allowed President Obama to reach an agreement with 11 other nations on a massive trade agreement.,"<p>Trade negotiators in Atlanta reached an agreement Monday that could affect everything from American exports of pharmaceuticals to New Zealand milk, Japanese rice, and Vietnamese textiles.</p> \n<p>The deal, known at the Trans-Pacific Partnership, would more closely link the economies of 12 Pacific Rim nations and have sweeping global implications. President Obama has portrayed it as essential to cementing America's relationships in Asia, but critics such as Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) have portrayed it as a giveaway to corporate interests and a threat to US sovereignty.</p> \n<p>Of all the issues under negotiation, the most contentious was legal protections for the pharmaceutical industry. American drug companies and their allies in the Obama administration have been pushing for new rules that would limit competition and boost drug prices. Other countries, with the support of public health groups, have pushed back, arguing that the measures would cost thousands of lives.</p> \n<p>Ultimately, the negotiators split the difference. They agreed to language that would require some countries to expand the legal protections afforded to drug companies (and raise prices in those countries), but big drug companies got less than they wanted.</p> \n<p>Now the action will move to Congress, which must approve the deal before it can take effect. We can expect the TPP to attract criticism from both ends of the political spectrum. Already, Vermont Sen. and presidential candidate Bernie Sanders (D-VT) has <a href=""http://observer.com/2015/10/bernie-sanders-calls-agreement-of-trans-pacific-partnership-disastrous/"">blasted</a> the deal as a victory for ""Wall Street and other big corporations,"" while Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-UT) has <a href=""http://www.politico.com/story/2015/10/trade-deal-future-in-washington-214429"">complained</a> that the drug protections in the bill ""fall woefully short"" of what the industry had requested. Obama faces a big challenge convincing critics on both sides that while the deal might not be perfect, it's still better than no deal at all.</p> \n<h3>The TPP is a lot more than just a trade deal</h3> \n<p>The TPP is usually described as a trade deal, and it certainly will have important provisions related to trade. Negotiators have been considering liberalizing trade in cars and trucks, rice, dairy products, textiles, and a lot more.</p> \n<p>But the agreement is also a lot more than a trade deal. It has more than two dozen chapters that cover everything from tariffs to the handling of international investment disputes. The reason these deals have gotten so complex is that people realized that they were a good vehicle for creating binding international agreements.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""center""><span>American negotiators — and, therefore, US interest groups — have had the most power in these negotiations</span></q></p> \n<p>Modern trade deals include a dispute settlement process that helps ensure countries keep the commitments they make under trade deals. If one country fails to keep its commitment, another country can file a complaint that's heard by an impartial tribunal. If the complaining country prevails, it can impose retaliatory tariffs on the loser.</p> \n<p>Interest groups have realized that this same mechanism can be used to enforce agreements on topics that have little to do with trade. And so a wide variety of interest groups — from Hollywood and the pharmaceutical industry to labor and environmental groups — have lobbied to include rules they favored in trade agreements. And because the US is the world's largest economy, American negotiators — and, therefore, US interest groups — have had the most power in these negotiations.</p> \n<p>For example, at the behest of Hollywood and other US copyright holders, American negotiators have been pushing other countries to adopt our long copyright terms: the life of the author plus 70 years. International investors have pushed for an investor-state dispute settlement process that allows private investors to challenge foreign government policies before an impartial arbitration panel — a process critics such as Sen. Warren describe as a threat to American sovereignty. Drug companies want other countries to provide the same robust legal protections for new drugs they enjoy in the United States.</p> \n<p>At the same time, labor and environment groups have pushed the Obama administration to incorporate their priorities into the agreement. The Obama administration insists the president has done just that, but so far these changes haven't gone far enough to convince these groups to endorse the agreement.</p> \n<h3>\n<span>Drug protections were t</span>he biggest sticking point</h3> \n<p>Previous trade deals already required TPP member countries to provide a minimum level of patent protection for pharmaceuticals, but most countries didn't provide protections as generous as those in the United States. Obama's trade negotiators wanted to include language in the TPP requiring other countries to make their laws more like those in the United States.</p> \n<p>The most controversial provision of all concerns a type of drugs called biologics. These drugs are produced by biological processes rather than being synthesized in a chemistry lab. Drug companies say that patents, which protect a specific chemical formula, do not always provide adequate protection for biologic drugs, because it's often possible to find another compound that's biologically equivalent even though it has a different chemical structure.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""right""><span>Even the Obama administration's own budget wonks believe 12 years of protection is excessive</span></q></p> \n<p>To prevent generic drug manufacturers from copying biologics and driving down their prices, big drug companies have used the regulatory process to limit competition. The Food and Drug Administration — and other regulatory agencies overseas — require drugmakers to prove that a drug is safe and effective before it can be introduced to the market. US law gives the creators of a drug exclusive rights to this data for a period of 12 years. Because clinical trials are expensive to perform, this effectively prevents generic drugmakers from creating competing drugs until the exclusivity period has expired.</p> \n<p>Even the Obama administration's own budget wonks believe 12 years of protection is excessive. They've proposed <a href=""https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/budget/fy2016/assets/budget.pdf"">reducing the protection period</a> to seven years, and estimated that increased generic drug competition would save Medicare and other federal health-care programs billions of dollars. At the same time, Obama's trade negotiators have been pushing for language that would lock in 12 years of protection in the United States and require other countries — most of which offer shorter terms of five or eight years — to adopt the same 12 years of protection as the United States.</p> \n<p>The full details of the compromise haven't been released — and might not be for another month — but <a href=""http://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-australia-agree-on-complicated-compromise-on-biologic-drugs-1443988019"">media reports</a> indicate that the US dropped its demand for 12 years of protection and settled for requiring five to eight years of protection instead. That's a significant concession for the United States, but it's still a victory of sorts for the pharmaceutical industry, since it will bar countries that currently offer five to eight years of protection from reducing it later. It also sets a floor, but not a ceiling — the United States will continue to offer 12 years of protection, and US negotiators may push for more lavish protections in future trade deals.</p> \n<h3>What happens next: months of waiting</h3> \n<p>While the TPP member countries have reached the outline of a deal, media reports suggest that not every detail of the agreement has been fully fleshed out. The New York Times <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/06/business/trans-pacific-partnership-trade-deal-is-reached.html"">predicts</a> that it will take about a month for these details to be worked out and for the final text of the deal to be made publicly available.</p> \n<p>After that, it will take another <a href=""http://www.flushthetpp.org/obama-administration-hype-about-a-tpp-vote-in-2015-does-not-comport-with-fast-track-timelines/"">three to four months</a> for Congress to enact a deal. Under the <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/6/23/8832107/tpa-tpp-obama-senate"">""fast-track"" legislation</a> authorizing Obama to negotiate the deal, the president must give Congress 90 days' notice before signing the trade deal, and then another wait another 30 days before introducing legislation implementing it. This means that even in the best-case scenario, Congress won't be able to vote on the controversial deal until early 2016. And it could be delayed by further wrangling, either among TPP member countries or within Congress.</p> \n<p>Obama's big challenge will be that the deal has something for everyone to hate. Drug company allies like Orrin Hatch are disappointed that US negotiators didn't get the generous drug protections they'd sought — that will make them less excited about the deal. Meanwhile, public health groups <a href=""http://www.raps.org/Regulatory-Focus/News/2015/10/05/23325/Final-TPP-Agreement-Draws-Ire-from-Both-Sides-over-Biologics-Exclusivity/"">believe</a> eight years of protection is too long.</p> \n<p>Nothing has happened in the past few months to mollify the TPP's many critics — most of whom come from the political left. We can expect many labor unions, environmental groups, and other left-leaning advocacy groups to lobby against the agreement.</p> \n<p>However, Obama also has a huge advantage: The Republican leadership has firmly supported Obama's trade agenda, and was able to assemble majorities for fast-track legislation earlier this year.

Here's what you need to know.,http://www.vox.com/2015/10/6/9465873/draftkings-fanduel-fantasy-sports-scandal,New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman is the latest public official to question the legality of daily fantasy sports leagues that pay out billions in prizes.,"<p>If you follow sports, you've likely seen dozens of advertisements for DraftKings and FanDuel, two companies that have pioneered a relatively new type of online gambling known as daily fantasy sports. A few weeks ago, the sports world was <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/06/sports/fanduel-draftkings-fantasy-employees-bet-rivals.html"">rocked by revelations</a> that a DraftKings employee with access to proprietary DraftKings data had won $350,000 in a FanDuel contest. That naturally led to speculation that his access to DraftKings data had given him an edge at FanDuel.</p> \n<p>Since then, federal and state regulators have been subjecting the two companies to greater scrutiny.</p> \n<p>In October, the <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-prosecutor-subpoenas-draftkings-1445471672"">Wall Street Journal reported</a> that DraftKings received a subpoena from US prosecutor Preet Bharara, who was probing whether a DraftKing employee misused proprietary information and whether<span> the business models of DraftKings and its major competitor, FanDuel, are running afoul of federal gambling laws.</span></p> \n<p>Now the companies are facing unwanted attention from New York's powerful attorney general too. <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/11/sports/football/draftkings-fanduel-new-york-attorney-general-tells-fantasy-sites-to-stop-taking-bets-in-new-york.html"">According to the New York Times</a>, Attorney General Eric Schneiderman has ordered DraftKings and FanDuel to stop taking bets in the state of New York, where DraftKings has 500,000 users.</p> \n<p>The companies deny their services are illegal gambling, and they could still fight the order in court. But the fact that multiple public officials are raising concerns about the legality of daily fantasy sites is an ominous sign for both companies.</p> \n<h3>Daily fantasy sports look a lot like online gambling</h3> \n<p>Fantasy sports have been around for decades; the concept first became popular for baseball before spreading to other sports. And in the early days, fantasy baseball wasn't such a big business.</p> \n<p><q class=""center"" aria-hidden=""true""><span>The concept caught on first in baseball thanks to the wealth of statistics available about baseball games</span></q></p> \n<p>It worked like this: At the beginning of the season, you would assemble an imaginary team — a pitcher, catcher, shortstop, and so forth — using the names of real, active players. Then, over the course of the season, your fantasy team would rack up points based on the real-world performance of the players you've chosen. You might also be able to trade players in your lineup with others in your fantasy league midway through the season. At the end of the season, the contestant whose imaginary team earns the most points wins the league.</p> \n<p>The concept caught on first in baseball thanks to the wealth of statistics available about baseball games. As the internet made it easier to find information about other sports, the concept spread beyond baseball — especially to football.</p> \n<p>In the past five years, a variant called daily fantasy sports has become popular. The basic concept — choosing fantasy teams and racking up points based on players' real-world performance — is the same. But whereas conventional fantasy sports provided fun, low-stakes entertainment for a group of friends (albeit often with some money at stake), daily fantasy leagues look a lot more like conventional sports gambling.</p> \n<p>The daily fantasy market is dominated by two relatively new companies: FanDuel (which has a <a href=""http://www.gaslampball.com/2015/3/24/8285275/sb-nation-and-fanduel-partner-up-for-second-straight-year-with-6000"">partnership</a> with Vox Media's sports site SB Nation) and DraftKings. Players might pay $5, $25, or $100 to enter a contest, and they can win prizes as large as $1 million. Rather than just competing against a few friends, people compete with thousands of strangers from across the country. Both companies have raised millions of dollars in venture capital, and they say they'll pay out more than a billion dollars in prizes in 2015.</p> \n<h3>Fantasy sports sites enjoy a special loophole in federal law</h3> \n<p>Major sports leagues lobbied for the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unlawful_Internet_Gambling_Enforcement_Act_of_2006"">ban on internet gambling</a> Congress passed in 2006 that shut down internet poker and other online gaming. But they also convinced Congress to carve out an exception for fantasy sports leagues because they boost fan interest in watching sports. As a result, fantasy leagues are the only form of sports betting that's legally available to most Americans.</p> \n<p>Companies like FanDuel and DraftKings have taken full advantage of the loophole. Today's daily fantasy sites feel more like professional gambling operations than a friendly office pool. And at least one legal expert believes these sites are <a href=""http://fortune.com/2015/09/24/draftkings-fanduel-legal/"">bumping up against the legal limit</a> under federal law.</p> \n<p>In the process, these companies have created an <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/8/25/9201183/fantasy-football-gambling-nfl"">awkward situation</a> for the NFL. In the past, it was easy for the NFL to argue that it should be in a different legal category from conventional sports betting. But daily fantasy leagues are blurring this line.</p> \n<h3>A DraftKings employee's big win on FanDuel created a PR headache for the industry</h3> \n<p>A few weeks ago, we <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/06/sports/fanduel-draftkings-fantasy-employees-bet-rivals.html"">learned</a> that DraftKings employee Ethan Haskell did two things on Sunday, September 27:</p> \n<ul> \n<li>He released data earlier than usual on how many people had chosen each athlete for an upcoming fantasy contest. With thousands of contestants competing in each round, leagues allow many people to choose the same fantasy athlete. DraftKings normally keeps this information confidential until fantasy players have finished choosing their players for a particular game.</li> \n<li>He won second place in a fantasy contest hosted by DraftKings competitor FanDuel, winning $350,000.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Naturally, a lot of people wondered if these events were connected. Because the payouts in daily fantasy games go disproportionately to the top players, data about which athletes are most and least popular among other fantasy players can help a contestant boost the odds of winning. And while Haskell didn't have access to any data about FanDuel users, the DraftKings and FanDuel contests are similar enough that data about DraftKings players' bets should have provided a lot of insight about both sites.</p> \n<p>However, DraftKings insists that <a href=""http://playbook.draftkings.com/uncategorized/draftkings-statement-10615/"">nothing of the sort happened</a>. The company says FanDuel's deadline for choosing players was 1 pm, while Haskell didn't get access to the DraftKings data until 1:40 pm — so data from DraftKings couldn't have helped him assemble his winning FanDuel roster.</p> \n<p><q class=""right"" aria-hidden=""true""><span>Knowing how other users have bet can help a user stand out from the crowd</span></q></p> \n<p>And to be clear, the data Haskell released was not sufficient, on its own, to win money. Far from it. Winning requires choosing a roster of players who perform well in a particular set of games. No one can know that in advance. So even someone who has data about other players' rosters will only be able to win a small percentage of the time.</p> \n<p>But daily fantasy sports, like most betting, is a game of averages. Knowing how other users have bet can help a user stand out from the crowd. And even modest improvements in the odds of winning can add up over the course of many bets.</p> \n<h3>The controversy is increasing public scrutiny of fantasy sports</h3> \n<p>In a brief <a href=""http://playbook.draftkings.com/uncategorized/draftkings-statement-10515/"">joint statement</a> released in early October, DraftKings and FanDuel insisted that they have strict policies in place to prevent employees from cheating on fantasy games. They also temporarily <a href=""http://www.si.com/nfl/2015/10/06/fanduel-draftkings-ban-employees-fantasy-sports-betting"">banned employees</a> from playing on competing sites (employees were already banned from playing on their own sites).</p> \n<p>The big worry for DraftKings and FanDuel is that the controversy over Haskell's winnings — whether or not they were based on inside informaiton — will cause policymakers to reconsider whether daily fantasy sports sites are, or should be, legal under federal law<span>. </span>Bharara might conclude that critics of DraftKings and FanDuel are right, and the sites don't actually qualify for the fantasy sports exemption. If he does, that could lead to a big legal battle that could force the sites to radically change their services or shut down altogether.</p> \n<p><span>It's also possible that Congress could become involved. Congress exempted fantasy sports from its online gambling ban at a time when fantasy leagues looked very different from conventional online gambling. But Congress could revisit that decision and impose new restrictions — restrictions that could make these fantasy sites much less profitable. At least one member of Congress has </span><a href=""http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/i-team/congressman-gambling-fantasy-sports-article-1.2369123"">questioned</a><span> whether the line drawn between fantasy sports and other forms of sports betting makes any sense.</span></p> \n<p>Of course, that line of reasoning could lead in one of two directions. One option would be to narrow the fantasy sports exemption and more strictly regulate — or ban altogether — sites like DraftKings and FanDuel. Or Congress could decide that online gambling really doesn't pose a threat to the republic and opt to open up the market to other forms of internet betting.</p>",Business & Finance
Buying a cellphone? Hereâ€™s how to get the best deal.,http://www.vox.com/2015/10/12/9489267/buying-a-cellphone-explained,"T-Mobile has been shaking up the wireless industry, abolishing the two-year contract and starting a price war. That means big savings for customers.","<p>There's been a lot of turmoil in the cellphone industry recently. Industry maverick T-Mobile has been cutting prices and rethinking longstanding industry practices, forcing other carriers to follow suit. The result: Consumers can get better deals than ever before, but they also face more — and more complicated — options than ever before.</p> \n<p>We're here to help. Read on to learn how the market has changed, the best options for getting a new smartphone, and how the nation's four major wireless networks compare on network quality.</p> \n<h3>How T-Mobile blew up the two-year contract and started a price war</h3> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4143768/GettyImages-471446398.0.jpg"" alt=""GettyImages-471446398.0.jpg"" data-chorus-asset-id=""4143768""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">T-Mobile CEO John Legere has been shaking up the wireless industry. (David A.Grogan/CNBC/NBCU Photo Bank via Getty Images)</p> \n<p>Two-year contracts used to be standard across the cellphone industry. In exchange for a two-year commitment, customers got a heavily discounted — sometimes even free — phone.</p> \n<p>Rolling the costs of a new cellphone into a customer's monthly bill avoided sticker shock and helped boost the growth of wireless service. But this arrangement also had some downsides. It encouraged customers to buy a new phone every two years, whether they needed one or not. And a lot of customers hated being locked into long-term contracts — and facing steep early termination fees if they broke them.</p> \n<p>So in 2013, T-Mobile <a href=""http://www.cnet.com/news/t-mobile-kills-off-the-wireless-contract/"">declared war on two-year contracts</a>. Under T-Mobile's new pricing structure, customers could cancel their service anytime they wanted, without paying an early termination fee. The flip side was that T-Mobile stopped subsidizing customers' handsets. Customers had to either bring their own phones, pay the full retail price for a new one, or pay for a phone in monthly installments.</p> \n<p>Because it was no longer subsidizing customers' handsets, T-Mobile could offer monthly rates dramatically lower than what its major competitors were charging.</p> \n<p>T-Mobile's strategy has proven so successful — this summer it <a href=""http://www.theverge.com/2015/8/4/9094415/sprint-now-fourth-place-us-carrier"">passed Sprint</a> as the No. 3 wireless carrier — that other companies have been forced to follow suit. Verizon <a href=""http://www.theverge.com/2015/8/7/9116493/verizon-is-doing-away-with-contracts"">announced it was phasing out contracts</a> in August of this year, and Sprint <a href=""http://www.theverge.com/2015/8/18/9171511/sprint-killing-phone-contracts"">announced it was following suit</a> a few days later. AT&amp;T is still offering two-year contracts, but its CEO has <a href=""http://recode.net/2015/06/02/atts-ralph-de-la-vega-subsidized-phones-are-going-away/"">predicted</a> that they are ""going to go away slowly.""</p> \n<p>T-Mobile's moves also touched off an industrywide price war. The result is that you can get more service — and, especially, bigger data plans — for less money.</p> \n<p>This has all been good for consumers, who can get more bang for their buck. If you've had the same cellphone plan for more than two years, you're probably getting a bad deal; it's worth checking out today's packages to see if you can get a better one.</p> \n<h3>The three ways you can get a new cellphone</h3> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4143776/GettyImages-491997580.0.jpg"" alt=""GettyImages-491997580.0.jpg"" data-chorus-asset-id=""4143776""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">( efa Karacan/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images)</p> \n<p>Wireless companies used to sell voice, data, and a cellphone in one bundle for a single monthly fee. T-Mobile forced the rest of the industry to unbundle these things from one another, making things more complicated. There are more options, and you can mix and match them in more ways.</p> \n<p>If you're in the market for wireless service, you have three basic options, in order from least to most convenient:</p> \n<ul> \n<li> <b>Bring your own device.</b> This could be the phone you used with your previous wireless plan, or it could be a new or used device you bought yourself.</li> \n<li> <b>Pay cash for a new device.</b> All four carriers offer zero percent financing plans to customers with good credit. If you qualify, you should probably take advantage.</li> \n<li> <b>Choose a leasing or early upgrade plan,</b> like <a href=""http://www.theverge.com/2015/6/25/8844935/t-mobile-jump-on-demand-leasing-program"">T-Mobile Jump</a>, <a href=""http://www.att.com/shop/wireless/next.html"">AT&amp;T Next</a>, or <a href=""http://www.theverge.com/2014/9/9/6129107/sprint-angling-iphone-6-buyers-with-free-iphone-for-life-leasing-plan"">Sprint Lease</a>.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>The most frugal option — and the one that involves the most hassle — is to buy a used phone and then bring it with you when you sign up for wireless service. If you buy a phone that's a year or two old, you can get a significant discount compared with a new phone. And you may also be able to sell your old phone, saving still more money. There are a <a href=""http://gizmodo.com/where-to-sell-your-old-iphone-for-the-most-money-1627158634"">number of sites</a>, including Amazon, Craigslist, and Glyde, that help people buy and sell used devices.</p> \n<p>But this approach has one big potential pitfall: You have to make sure the phone you choose will work with the network of the wireless network you choose. The details here are beyond the scope of this article, but if you buy a relatively new phone that was previously used on the same network you want to use, you should generally be okay.</p> \n<p>At the opposite end of the cost and convenience spectrum are the leasing and early-upgrade plans. These allow you to pay a somewhat higher monthly rate in exchange for being able to upgrade your phone more quickly than the standard two-year cycle. They generally require you to trade in your old phone to get a new one, saving you the hassle of disposing of old phones.</p> \n<p>However, for most people the best option will be to buy a phone using a two-year financing option and then hold on to it for more than two years. After two years, your phone will be paid off, so your monthly bill will drop. If you can hold on to your phone for more than two years, you can save a significant amount of money.</p> \n<h3>The best wireless carrier might depend on where you live</h3> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4143780/GettyImages-476795070.0.jpg"" alt=""GettyImages-476795070.0.jpg"" data-chorus-asset-id=""4143780""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">(Roberto Machado Noa/LightRocket via Getty Images)</p> \n<p>Which carrier should you choose? The national wireless market is divided into two tiers. AT&amp;T and Verizon are the two largest carriers in the country, with more than two-thirds of the market between them. T-Mobile and Sprint are each about half as large.</p> \n<p>Generally speaking, the larger carriers <a href=""http://www.rootmetrics.com/us/blog/special-reports/year-in-review-2014-us#state"">tend to have better network coverage</a>. Verizon is widely viewed as having the most extensive network, followed by AT&amp;T, Sprint, and T-Mobile. On the other hand, Verizon and AT&amp;T tend to charge more than their smaller rivals.</p> \n<p>However, you don't care how these companies' networks perform in general — you only care how they work in the cities and neighborhoods where you're going to spend time. If Sprint or T-Mobile's network works well near your home and office, you might be totally satisfied with them even if they offer poor coverage in other areas.</p> \n<p>The Verizon and AT&amp;T networks are superior in two specific ways. One is service in rural areas. The larger networks can afford to spend more on cellphone towers, so they're able to cover more remote areas than the smaller carriers can. So if you live in a small town, you'll probably want to go with one of them. However, if you spend all your time in urban areas, this might not matter.</p> \n<p>The larger carriers' other big advantage is that they have more low-frequency spectrum. This kind of spectrum is a lot better at passing through thick walls and other obstructions. That means that if you happen to live in a huge apartment complex, or you work in a big office tower surrounded by other office towers, you might find T-Mobile and Sprint's coverage frustratingly spotty.</p> \n<p>In urban areas where T-Mobile and Sprint do have coverage, on the other hand, the smaller carriers have an advantage of their own. Because they have fewer customers, wireless connections are often faster.</p> \n<p>If you're not sure which carrier is best for you, you might want to take advantage of carriers' return policies. All four wireless providers allow customers to return their phones and cancel their wireless plans within 14 days — though note that some charge restocking fees of around $50. So you can sign up with the cheapest provider that seems to meet your needs and see how it performs. If connectivity is disappointing, you can return the device and sign up with someone else.</p>",Business & Finance
"The 2015 Nobel Prize for Economics winner, Angus Deaton, explained",http://www.vox.com/2015/10/12/9505213/angus-deaton-nobel-prize,A scholar who looked under the hood to show what's really happening.,"<p>Angus Deaton, born in Scotland but a longtime professor at Princeton, has won the <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.nobelprize.org/"">2015 Nobel Prize for Economics</a> ""for his analysis of consumption, poverty, and welfare."" Deaton is well-known for a broad body of work rather than for a handful of breakthrough papers. But it is possible to understand his output as falling along a couple of themes. Methodologically, Deaton is about both empiricism and individualism,<i> </i>arguing for a close look at data on how specific human beings and households behave, rather than stylized models or big national-level aggregate data.</p> \n<p>Substantively, this is because he's trying to look behind the easiest summary statistics and understand what is actually happening in people's lives — who is better off than whom, and why. That's a subject that has very broad application. We might wonder if the average person in Oslo is better off than the average person in Orlando, and by how much. But it's of particular interest when we're thinking about questions of <i>poverty</i>. If we want to improve the lot of the worst-off people, we need to know who they are and how to measure improvements in their well-being.</p> \n<h3>Deaton's early work on two technical problems</h3> \n<p>Deaton originally rose to prominence for work on two technical issues. The first of these was the creation of the <a href=""https://www.aeaweb.org/aer/top20/70.3.312-326.pdf"" target=""_blank"">Almost Ideal Demand System</a>, AIDS, which was first published in 1980 just before that acronym came to be known for something else entirely.</p> \n<p>A very simple demand system says that if the price of apples falls, people will buy more apples. A natural complicating observation is that if the price of apples falls but the price of oranges falls even more, people actually might buy <i>fewer</i> apples because they are gorging on oranges. Comparing apples to oranges is a legendarily difficult problem, but to understand what products people will want to consume, you more or less need to compare everything to everything. AIDS was a promising effort to show how we can do all the aggregations necessary to understand these dynamics, and it's been the subject of a lot of subsequent refinement by various economists.</p> \n<p>Deaton also worked on a problem known as the <a href=""http://www.jstor.org/stable/2109680?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents"" target=""_blank"">Deaton Paradox</a>, which is a kind of puzzle internal to the widespread economic assumption that people have a more or less rational, forward-looking behavioral pattern.</p> \n<p>This kind of work propelled Deaton's career forward but isn't really what he's best known for.</p> \n<h3>Comparisons of living standards</h3> \n<p>Money is a really convenient way of comparing how people are faring economically. Saying Jose has $1,000 more than Joe but $2,000 less than Giuseppe is very simple and relatively easy to verify.</p> \n<p>But whenever you try to take these kind of simple cash comparisons into the real world, immediate problems resolve. If Jose lives in Texas but Joe lives in Toronto, then one of them has US dollars and the other has Canadian dollars. You can convert between the currencies using market exchange rates, but <a href=""http://finance.yahoo.com/echarts?s=CADUSD%3DX+Interactive#%7B"" target=""_blank"">exchange rates bounce up and down at the speed of financial markets</a>, and it's not plausible that living standards shift that quickly. We need to start looking at what people are <i>actually consuming</i> — the food, cars, medicine, etc. that make up economic life.</p> \n<p>Yet the further afield you go, the harder this kind of problem becomes. The price of an iPhone is very similar around the world, with the difference largely accounted for by taxes and short-term currency fluctuations. But a haircut is cheaper in Hanoi than in Harrisburg, and cheaper in Harrisburg than in Helsinki. So the cost of living varies from place to place. But it also varies according to what you mean by ""living"" — the extent of the variation depends on what it is you are buying. If people in Hanoi don't get haircuts as often as people in Helsinki, the fact that haircuts are cheaper isn't as big of a benefit.</p> \n<h3>Empirical individualism</h3> \n<p>Deaton does not have one giant paper that solves this problem. The whole point of his work, rather, is that it's a problem that requires both theoretical sophistication and a lot of piecemeal work. <a href=""http://scholar.princeton.edu/deaton/poverty-world-and-india"" target=""_blank"">Here are his papers on poverty in India</a>, for example. It is not a small number of papers.</p> \n<p>In a big-picture sense, Deaton is urging both empiricism and individualism. The easiest thing to do in economics is to choose one or the other. The most widely available empirical data is data about big aggregates — how much did Americans as a whole spend on this or that — and there's a long tradition of work grounded in observing the movements of these big aggregates. There is also a counter-tradition that insists on building up our model of how the big picture works from economists' standard model of how rational individual humans behave. This generates elegant but highly stylized takes on what is going on.</p> \n<p>Deaton's approach emphasizes the use of household surveys and other finer-grained sources of empirical data. And it does so due to an appreciation, on a theoretical level, of the importance of diversity. Economic conditions vary enormously from place to place and from person to person. Poor people consume different sorts of things than do rich people, and these patterns vary across place and time.</p> \n<p>This is crucially important when it comes to measuring poverty — you can <a href=""http://www.princeton.edu/rpds/papers/pdfs/deaton_povertymeasured.pdf"" target=""_blank"">read a nontechnical account of Deaton's approach</a> here — because it implies that governments and nonprofits interested in combating poverty need a fine-grained understanding of how it varies as a phenomenon from place to place. It's not enough to set the poverty line at $1.90 a day and the see how it's changing around the world. You need to see what $1.90 a day actually <i>means</i> in Nigeria versus Nepal, versus Nanjing.</p> \n<h3>Health and well-being</h3> \n<p>Deaton's interest in consumption, and peering behind the veil of money, eventually led him into the arenas of health and well-being. For many people, health-care services constitute a large share of their spending and consumption. But while people buy movie tickets because they want to watch a movie, people don't really pay for doctors' visits because they like sitting in doctors' offices. The idea is to <i>get healthier</i>. And yet it's well-known that health is impacted by lots of things (diet, exercise, stress) that aren't health-care services, and also that lots of health-care services don't do much to improve health.</p> \n<p> \n<script charset=""utf-8"" src=""//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js""></script> \n</p> \n<blockquote lang=""en"" class=""twitter-tweet""> \n<p dir=""ltr"" lang=""en"">Angus Deaton is the Obi-Wan Kenobi of Economics.   Breathtaking range of work in poverty, health, healthcare, wellbeing, methods…</p> \n— Amitabh Chandra (@amitabhchandra2) <a href=""https://twitter.com/amitabhchandra2/status/653537137384550400"">October 12, 2015</a>\n</blockquote> \n<p>This is a big deal in rich countries where health-care costs are so important, but it's also a big deal in poor countries. Many foreign donors are very interested in improving public health, possibly as a tool for fostering economic growth. At the same time, one of the best things about economic growth is that it might foster better public health. Deaton's inquiries into poverty and consumption fed into this area, and his work is well-known among public health and development specialists.</p> \n<h3>Popular writing</h3> \n<p>Deaton is very much an economists' economist, but he's also a clear writer who dabbled in more popular fare. His book <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/The-Great-Escape-Origins-Inequality/dp/0691165629"" target=""_blank""><i>The Great Escape</i></a> paints an optimistic picture of modernity and the benefits of economic development.</p> \n<p>For a while now he's written a biannual <a href=""http://scholar.princeton.edu/deaton/letters-america"" target=""_blank"">""Letter From America""</a> for the Royal Economic Society offering views on <a href=""http://scholar.princeton.edu/sites/default/files/deaton/files/letterfromamerica_oct2014.pdf"" target=""_blank"">the need for regional price indexes</a>, the benefits of a <a href=""http://scholar.princeton.edu/sites/default/files/deaton/files/letterfromamerica_oct2009_0.pdf"" target=""_blank"">single-payer health-care system</a> but the unlikeliness of adopting one, the <a href=""http://www.res.org.uk/view/article1Apr12Correspondence.html"" target=""_blank"">impact of unemployment and health and happiness</a>, and <a href=""http://scholar.princeton.edu/sites/default/files/deaton/files/letterfromamerica_oct2010_0.pdf"" target=""_blank"">budget cuts to state university systems</a>.</p> \n<h3>Criticisms of foreign aid and RCTs</h3> \n<p>Deaton is a very widely admired economist but does stake out two controversial positions in development economics that ruffle some feathers. One is that he is <a href=""http://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/economic-development-requires-effective-governments-by-angus-deaton"" target=""_blank"">sharply critical of foreign aid</a>, seeing improved state capacity as the key to sustainable economic development in poor countries, and aid as useless to counterproductive in achieving it.

The fascinating economics behind Playboy's decision to drop nudes from its magazine,http://www.vox.com/2015/10/13/9523879/playboy-nudity-no,"It's not a joke: Starting with the March issue, you're going to have to read Playboy for the articles.","<p>Starting with the March issue, due to hit newsstands this weekend, Playboy magazine will no longer feature explicit nudity. <span>It sounds like an April Fools' joke, but it's not: The New York Times was given a copy of the latest issue, and what used to be an NC-17 publication is now more like PG-13.</span></p> \n<p>This isn't about prudishness so much as it is about money: Playboy CEO Scott Flanders believes the Playboy brand can transcend its salacious origins and become a lucrative vehicle for selling mainstream products. There's already a <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/s?rh=n:7141123011,p_4:Playboy"">wide variety of Playboy-branded clothing and jewelry</a> out there, and the Playboy brand is particularly popular in China, where pornography is officially illegal.</p> \n<p>Playboy tested this strategy with the Playboy.com website, which has been free of explicit nudity since 2014. The company says it's been a big success, attracting a much bigger and younger audience. Now it's hoping to expand on that success with what used to be the country's most popular pornographic magazine.</p> \n<h3>Playboy is dropping explicit nudity from its flagship magazine</h3> \n<p>Beginning with next month's issue, there won't be any explicit nude images of women in the US edition of Playboy magazine. The Times reports that there are still some naked women in the issue but that the images are ""shot in ways intended for strategic concealment"" — much like men's magazines such as Maxim and Stuff.</p> \n<p>In 1953, Playboy made its mark by being one of the first mainstream magazines to feature pictures of nude women. In the pre-internet era, porn was a lot harder to obtain, so there was a big market for pornographic magazines. The magazine grew to more than <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/13/business/media/nudes-are-old-news-at-playboy.html"">5 million subscribers</a> by the 1970s and attracted a bunch of competitors.</p> \n<p>But the internet has totally transformed the pornography industry. Today, any kind of porn you can imagine is just a Google search away and in most cases is available for free. So over the past couple of decades, the value proposition of paying $19.95 a year to have a few dozen nude images delivered in dead-tree format each month has become less and less compelling. By last year, the magazine only had around 800,000 subscribers.</p> \n<p><q class=""right"" aria-hidden=""true""><span>The internet has totally transformed the pornography industry</span></q></p> \n<p>On the other hand, Playboy has always aspired to be more than just a pornographic magazine. Over the decades, those 5 million subscribers allowed Playboy to do interviews with a wide variety of famous people, including Martin Luther King Jr., Jimmy Carter, and Steve Jobs.</p> \n<p>There's a long-running joke about people ""reading Playboy for the articles,"" but Playboy's non-pornographic content really has been pretty good over the years. Now it won't be such a joke anymore. Playboy will tone down the nudity while beefing up its coverage of other topics, including a new sex column and expanded coverage of the liquor business.</p> \n<h3>Cutting nudity from Playboy.com was a big success</h3> \n<p>Playboy used to look like a conventional media company with a stable of magazines, websites, television stations, and so forth. But that business model hasn't done well in the internet age, and it reached its nadir in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis.</p> \n<p>So the company began downplaying its media properties and focusing instead on promoting and licensing its iconic brand. And Flanders started to wonder whether distributing pictures of naked women was becoming a business liability. ""You could argue that nudity is a distraction for us and actually shrinks our audience rather than expands it,"" he <a href=""http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/240346"">argued</a> in 2014.</p> \n<p><q class=""center"" aria-hidden=""true""><span>Dropping the naked women dramatically expanded the potential audience for Playboy.com</span></q></p> \n<p>Lots of people are attracted to the risqué vibe of the Playboy brand, but there are situations in which outright pornography isn't allowed. Apple's App Store, for example, doesn't allow apps to have sexually explicit imagery, for example, nor do Facebook and Instagram.</p> \n<p>So last year, Playboy overhauled its primary website, Playboy.com, and took out all the explicit nudity (there are still plenty of racy near-nude shots of the type you'll find in other men's magazines). Playboy executives <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/13/business/media/nudes-are-old-news-at-playboy.html?_r=0"">told the New York Times</a> that this was a huge success: Traffic quadrupled, and the average age of readers fell from 47 to 30.</p> \n<p>In other words, young people who grew up in the porn-saturated world of the internet aren't that interested in Playboy.com as a place to get porn. And the existence of naked women on the site made it awkward to read Playboy articles at work — where many people spend time goofing off online — or share Playboy content on social media sites. Dropping the naked women dramatically expanded the potential audience for Playboy.com without significantly reducing its appeal.</p> \n<h3>Playboy is trying to become a mainstream consumer brand</h3> \n<p>More traffic and a younger audience are big successes in their own right, but even more importantly, the shift helps make the Playboy brand more mainstream. There's already a large demand for Playboy-branded merchandise, and Flanders is betting that that demand will grow even more if Playboy becomes less associated with explicit pornography in the minds of the public.</p> \n<p>The decision to drop nudity from the magazine is best seen in this light. The goal isn't so much to make the magazine itself more successful — though presumably its owners would like to do that — but to make the magazine a more effective sales tool for the Playboy brand more generally.</p> \n<p>Playboy's magazine hasn't been a big moneymaker in years. Flanders <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/13/business/media/nudes-are-old-news-at-playboy.html"">told the New York Times</a> last year that the US edition of the magazine lost around $3 million last year. But Playboy's efforts to cash in on its brand — and particularly its famous bunny logo — are paying big dividends.</p> \n<p><q class=""center"" aria-hidden=""true""><span>The goal is to make the magazine a more effective sales tool for the Playboy brand more generally</span></q></p> \n<p>Playboy's brand is not only widely known in the West, it's also surprisingly popular in China. In 2014, Playboy-branded products <a href=""http://money.cnn.com/2015/05/06/media/playboy-china/"">generated $1.5 billion in revenues</a> in China, about a third of the worldwide total. Playboy merchandise is available in 3,500 retail outlets in China — which is particularly remarkable because <a href=""http://www.theatlantic.com/china/archive/2013/06/sex-and-the-law-in-china-the-people-will-pull-and-the-government-will-follow/276610/"">pornography is officially illegal</a> there.</p> \n<p>Flanders hopes that making the magazine less porny and more mainstream will help make the Playboy-branded products more mainstream as well — and dramatically expand the market for them.</p> \n<h3>Playboy-branded pornography isn't going away</h3> \n<p>There will no longer be naked ladies in Playboy magazine or at Playboy.com, but that doesn't mean we'll stop seeing explicit imagery distributed under the Playboy brand.</p> \n<p>In 2011, Playboy signed a deal with the internet porn company Manwin, since renamed MindGeek, to manage many of the company's online properties and television channels. Playboy later regained control over the Playboy.com site, but the rest of Playboy's pornographic empire, including the Playboy Plus subscription service and Playboy TV, continues to be operated by MindGeek.</p> \n<p>This might mean that Playboy can have the best of both worlds: It could enjoy the commercial benefits of a more mainstream image while continuing to profit indirectly from its pornography business.</p> \n<p>On the other hand, if dropping pornography from the website pays big dividends for Playboy's licensing business, it's possible the company will seek to shut down its other pornographic properties as well. That might be tricky, since Playboy's licensing agreement with MindGeek runs for 15 years (meaning Playboy might not get control back until 2026). But if Playboy becomes determined to separate itself fully from the pornography business, it might be able to cut a deal with MindGeek to end the deal early, or to choose a new brand name for its pornographic content.</p> \n<hr> \n<h3>Watch: The economics of why weddings are so expensive</h3> \n<!--  ########  BEGIN VOLUME VIDEO  ########  --> \n<div data-volume-uuid=""e48e489d3"" class=""volume-video"" id=""volume-placement-6061"" data-volume-placement=""article"" data-analytics-placement=""article:middle"" data-volume-id=""3478"" data-analytics-label=""Why are weddings so damn expensive? | 3478"" data-analytics-action=""volume:view:article:middle"" data-analytics-viewport=""video""></div> \n<!--  ########  END VOLUME VIDEO  ########  -->",Business & Finance
2 Australian mines are now operating with an all-driverless fleet of trucks,http://www.vox.com/2015/10/19/9567289/driverless-truck-rio-tinto,The autonomous revolution is going to start with weird cases like this.,"<p>The first big commercial deployment of driverless car technology is coming not in the streets of Silicon Valley but in the arid and sparsely populated Pilbara region of Australia. That's where the large mining conglomerate Rio Tinto has rolled out fleets of all-driverless trucks at two iron ore mines, according to a report by <a href=""https://next.ft.com/content/43f7436a-7632-11e5-a95a-27d368e1ddf7"">Jamie Smyth at the Financial Times</a>.</p> \n<p>Rio Tinto tells Smyth that the driverless transition has improved performance by 12 percent, mainly by ""eliminating required breaks, absenteeism and shift changes.""</p> \n<p>GPS guides the trucks and allows them to deliver iron ore 24/7, 365 days a year, without the kinds of breaks and handover periods that human drivers would need. The GPS navigation system is backstopped by a team of human operators working remotely from Perth, hundreds of miles away. Not only does this reduce the total number of humans who are needed to run the trucking operation, but it eliminates the need to employ those humans in the remote and desolate mining country<em>. </em>A mine needs to be located where the ore is, and you often end up needing to pay a premium to recruit workers to ore-adjacent locations. Remote workers, by contrast, can live in a nice suburb of a midsize city.</p> \n<h3>Why driverless is coming to mines first</h3> \n<p>But of course mining operations are hardly the only companies that could save money by replacing human drivers with robots. The big difference is that the mine setting offers a huge advantage that most companies can't match — there are no human drivers on the road.</p> \n<p>As <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/10/7/9471393/driverless-cars-challenges"">David Roberts has written</a>, one of the biggest technical challenges in making a general-purpose autonomous vehicle is that it would have to deal with all those crazy human beings. If all the cars were autonomous and networked, they would interact and communicate in predictable ways. But for that to happen in a normal transportation context, you would first need a transition phase in which autonomous cars <em>co-exist</em> with human-piloted ones long enough for them to gain trust and traction.</p> \n<p>Rio Tinto doesn't have that problem. It controls the entire site, and can make the transition to an all-autonomous fleet all at once. There's no ""transition period""; there's just a transition.</p> \n<h3>Commercial settings will go driverless first</h3> \n<p>To most people, the current face of driverless car technology is a pretty normal-looking Google car cruising the streets of the Bay Area. But most of the concrete progress over the next few years is likely to happen in areas that are more conceptually and geographically distant from the core functions of the modern automobile.</p> \n<p>Rio Tinto is only doing this at two mines so far, and it has a lot more mines. There are also other mining companies, and other companies in fields like lumber harvesting that involve a similar need to haul lots of heavy stuff around privately owned land. You probably won't hear them called ""driverless cars,"" but warehouse robots that move things around a confined space while interacting with a limited set of other robots are also starting to come into use. Automation of light trucks and specialized vehicles on farms and ranches would be an interesting next step. These are in some ways closer to the generic ""driverless car"" case, but they also involve private land and not many people.</p> \n<p>After that, who knows — zoos and amusement parks? Airports? Transit buses with dedicated lanes? The point is that rather than seeing a slow trickle of autonomous cars start to appear on busy streets (the way we have seen with electric cars, for example), you are likely to see mass adoption of driverless vehicles in settings that are somewhat marginal to the core market for light vehicles. Then if the technology succeeds, it will gobble up more and more slices, along the way establishing the kind of clear track record and public understanding that would be necessary to move into the core area.</p>",Business & Finance
How NIMBYs make your paycheck smaller,http://www.vox.com/2015/10/20/9570175/labor-share-housing,"Workers are getting a smaller slice of the pie, and it's going to landlords, not business owners.","<p>One of the really big and disturbing economic trends of the past 15 years has been a steep decline in the share of national income going to workers, in the form of wages and benefits, as opposed to going to owners of capital. A new report from the White House focused on a larger question about <a href=""https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/page/files/20151016_firm_level_perspective_on_role_of_rents_in_inequality.pdf"">""economic rents""</a> sheds some interesting light on the specific mechanics of <em>how</em> this shift is happening.</p> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""4174838""><img src=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4174838/laborshare.png""></div> \n<p>This phenomenon — <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/1/8/7511281/labor-share-income"">a decline in the labor share of income</a> —  hadn't really happened before. In fact, economists had kind of convinced themselves that it <em>couldn't</em> happen, and that the labor share was something like a fixed property of the economy.</p> \n<p>But obviously that was wrong. And the most natural interpretation of <em>why</em> it's wrong is that the bosses are getting one over on the rest of us. Maybe it's globalization, maybe it's automation, maybe it's the decline of labor unions, maybe it's neoliberal hegemony (why not), or maybe it's something to do with workplace skills. But whatever it is, it means that the American worker's power to bargain for wages and benefits has declined, hence the declining share of income going to workers' wages and benefits.</p> \n<p>Except that's wrong, too. Check out this chart — it shows that the rise in the share of national income going to the owners of businesses has only nudged up very slightly. The rise is in the share of income going to the owners of <em>houses</em>.</p> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""4174840""><img src=""https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4174840/capitalshare.png""></div> \n<p>That's something people <em>definitely</em> used to think couldn't happen. After all, if owning houses becomes more lucrative, then people should respond to market incentives by building more houses. There's no way houses could just get more and more and more valuable. Except, of course, a house isn't just a house. It's also a place. Location, location, location, as the realtors say. A house that's within a decent commuting distance of Google or JP Morgan is worth a lot more than a similarly sized house in San Antonio or Memphis or Cleveland. You can always make more houses, but you can't make more land.</p> \n<p>The pioneering 18th-century economist David Ricardo thought this scarce supply of land spelled long-term immiseration for working people. Over time, as the population grew, it was landlords — the people who owned the most useful land — who were going to reap all the gains.</p> \n<p>But what Ricardo had in mind was <em>agricultural </em>land. He was writing before the Industrial Revolution (to say nothing of the internet), so what he meant by useful land was good land to grow crops or raise sheep. After all, even way back in Ricardo's day it was technologically possible to fit a whole<em> </em>bunch of people on a parcel of land by constructing adjoining houses rather than separate ones each on their own lot. And with modern technology, we can even stack homes vertically and use elevators to access dwellings hundreds of feet in the air.</p> \n<p>Except across the vast majority of America's valuable land we've made it <em>illegal</em> to build rowhouses or apartment buildings. And so the land's value only increases, the rents going to its owners accumulate, and workers lose out.</p>",Business & Finance
Carl Icahn creates $150 million Super PAC advocating enormous tax cut for Carl Icahn,http://www.vox.com/2015/10/21/9583646/carl-icahn-super-pac,Not most people's idea of what ending dysfunction is about.,"<p>Legendary investor Carl Icahn <a href=""http://carlicahn.com/needed-legislation-letter/"">today pledged $150 million to launch a new Super PAC</a> designed to advocate for what he calls ""desperately needed legislation"" to address ""the pernicious effects that are occurring and will continue to occur as a result of Congress’s failure to immediately stop so many of our great companies from leaving our country."" This is the problem of so-called <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/9/22/6830683/heres-obamas-plan-to-curb-corporate-tax-inversions"">tax inversions</a>, in which companies that are primarily based in the US shift their nominal headquarters overseas to reduce their tax burden. It's an interesting issue, a somewhat important one, and something that Congress should address.</p> \n<blockquote class=""twitter-tweet"" lang=""en""> \n<p lang=""en"" dir=""ltr"">1/2 I am starting a Super PAC with my initial commitment of $150 million to help end the crippling dysfunction in Congress</p> \n— Carl Icahn (@Carl_C_Icahn) <a href=""https://twitter.com/Carl_C_Icahn/status/656847494584799233"">October 21, 2015</a>\n</blockquote> \n<blockquote class=""twitter-tweet"" lang=""en""> \n<p lang=""en"" dir=""ltr"">2/2 I have therefore sent the following letter to the relevant committees and leaders of Congress: <a href=""https://t.co/EGcuHvzou4"">https://t.co/EGcuHvzou4</a></p> \n— Carl Icahn (@Carl_C_Icahn) <a href=""https://twitter.com/Carl_C_Icahn/status/656847655667011588"">October 21, 2015</a>\n</blockquote> \n<p> \n<script src=""//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"" charset=""utf-8""></script> \n</p> \n<p>But peer into the details, and what Icahn is actually doing is pledging $150 million to the cause of helping Carl Icahn get even richer. As large a sum of money as $150 million is, Icahn's personal stake in the legislation at hand is even bigger.</p> \n<h3>Icahn is pushing a bill to create a one-time windfall for shareholders</h3> \n<p>The specific bill Icahn is advocating for isn't a narrow effort to address tax inversions; it's a broad effort to cut corporate income tax rates while generating a one-time windfall for people who currently own large blocks of shares in cash-rich companies. That's what Icahn is talking about when he refers to ""passing legislation for international tax reform as outlined in the framework put forth by Senators Charles Schumer and Robert Portman, and supported by Chairman Paul Ryan, to fund the Highway Bill.""</p> \n<p>Here's how it works:</p> \n<ul> \n<li>Right now, US-based firms have about $2.2 trillion in cash stored in their foreign subsidiaries in order to avoid paying US corporate income tax on it.</li> \n<li>Schumer and Portman want to change the law in two ways to have less money stashed in tax shelters.</li> \n<li>They want to levy a modest one-time tax on the $2.2 trillion.</li> \n<li>After that, they want to impose a substantially reduced rate on future foreign earnings so as to increase the incentive to actually pay up rather than investing in tax avoidance. </li> \n</ul> \n<h3>Icahn stands to reap massive personal gains from this idea</h3> \n<p>Proponents of this plan hope that it would increase federal tax revenue. They also hope that by making it cheaper for companies to ""repatriate"" cash from their foreign subsidiaries that it would increase their incentive to invest money in the United States. But another thing that it would do is make it cheaper for companies to pay dividends to shareholders. Right now, if you are a company with profits stashed abroad you need to pay corporate income tax on those profits before you ""bring them home"" to pay dividends.</p> \n<p>The single company with the most overseas cash is Apple. Icahn is one of Apple's largest shareholders. His big idea for Apple as a business is that <a href=""http://www.slate.com/articles/business/moneybox/2013/12/carl_icahn_s_apple_play_tim_cook_should_ignore_him.html"">it should pay more dividends</a>.</p> \n<p>So let's do the math:</p> \n<ul> \n<li>Apple has $180 billion in overseas cash right now.</li> \n<li>Icahn owns 0.5 percent of Apple, or $900 million in cash.</li> \n<li>Under current law, Apple would need to pay $315 million in taxes on that $900 million before giving it to Icahn.</li> \n<li>Schumer-Portman does not specify a number for the one-time levy, but a number in the 8 percent range would be sufficient to plug the hole in the Highway Trust Fund.<span> </span>\n</li> \n</ul> \n<p>At an 8 percent rate, Icahn would save about $243 million in potential taxes on his Apple dividends. That — or even a slightly higher rate — would easily generate a healthy ROI for a $150 million investment in a Super PAC. And that's just from the one-time levy, just from Apple. Icahn presumably has other investments, and Icahn also would be able to take advantage of continued lower taxes on Apple's foreign profits.</p>",Business & Finance
The Silicon Valley housing crisis is so bad that a Google engineer is living in a truck,http://www.vox.com/2015/10/22/9595682/google-employee-truck,"Google's hometown of Mountain View has strictly limited the number of small, cheap apartments that can be built near the Google campus.","<p>For the past few months, a guy named Brandon has been living in a truck in Google's parking lot and documenting the experience on his <a href=""http://frominsidethebox.com/"">blog</a>. He's a software engineer at Google, a company famous for its generous amenities. Brandon is able to eat meals, take showers, and work out on Google's campus, which he says makes it practical for him to live in the back of a box truck — with no kitchen, running water, or other amenities.</p> \n<p>He says he's doing this to save money. Rent for a studio apartment costs around $2,000 per month, he says. The truck cost just $10,000, and his only recurring expense is $121 per month for truck insurance — so just a few months into the experiment, he's already saved more money than he spent on the truck, and he expects to save tens of thousands of dollars over the next few years.</p> \n<h3>Google's hometown has created massive housing scarcity</h3> \n<p>Obviously, living in the back of a truck is an unorthodox solution to the problem of high housing costs.

That includes plenty of land that's a short walking distance from shops and even the commuter rail station. Building small, cheap apartments — or even connected rows of adjacent townhouses — in these neighborhoods is illegal.</p> \n<p>There are some areas where apartment buildings are allowed, but even here there are <a href=""https://www.municode.com/library/ca/mountain_view/codes/code_of_ordinances?nodeId=PTIITHCO_CH36ZO_ARTIVREZO_DIV5MUMIR3ZODIST_S36.10.60R3ZODIST"">strict limits</a>. They can't be taller than 45 feet — about four stories — and an apartment building can't occupy more than 40 percent of the lot on which it's located. And each housing unit needs to include a storage locker and parking.</p> \n<p>All of these restrictions limit the number of small, cheap housing units developers can supply. That's why studio apartments in the area cost $2,000 per month — far more than the <a href=""http://www.apartmentguide.com/blog/rental-price-per-square-foot/"">national median of slightly below $800</a>.</p> \n<h3>Google has proposed upzoning, with little success</h3> \n<p>Google has noticed that its younger workers are struggling to find affordable and convenient housing, and has been lobbying the Mountain View city council for permission to build more high-density housing in the northernmost part of Mountain View. But city council members have been hostile to the very idea of providing small, affordable apartments for young workers.</p> \n<p>""One thousand units of single-occupancy rooms, that's not a community, that's dorms,"" council member <a href=""http://www.mv-voice.com/print/story/2012/07/13/google-housing-axed-in-citys-general-plan"">Ronit Bryant said</a> at a 2012 meeting where Google's proposal was considered. ""It's done a lot in China. Huge factories, huge apartment blocks, I don't think everyone lives happily ever after.""</p> \n<p>No one dreams of living in a tiny apartment forever, of course. But there's nothing wrong with people choosing spartan accommodations when they're young, single, and working long hours at a demanding job — allowing them to save up money they can use to buy a house later on.</p> \n<h3>Google's workers are suffering, but the working class is suffering a lot more</h3> \n<p>More importantly, refusing to accommodate Google's growing workforce won't lead to everyone living ""happily ever after,"" either (there's a guy living in a truck, after all). Quite the contrary: By reserving most of its residential land for single-family homes, Mountain View guarantees that there won't be enough housing for everyone who wants to live there. Instead, Google workers have been forced to seek housing further and further afield. Many now have hour-long commutes on Google shuttles that bring them in from San Francisco.</p> \n<p>In the process, they've displaced less affluent people in surrounding communities, contributing to a region-wide affordable housing crisis. Indeed, less affluent people are the biggest victims of excessive housing regulations in Mountain View — and other nearby communities that also limit housing development.</p> \n<p>Ultimately, engineers at Google will always be able to find housing they can afford — even if they have to take an hour-long trip in a Google shuttle to get to work.

How a culture of secrecy set Theranos up for failure,http://www.vox.com/2015/10/23/9603442/theranos-elizabeth-holmes-secrecy,Conventional wisdom says that Silicon Valley startups should bring their products to market as quickly as possible. Theranos did the opposite.,"<p>Investors valued the medical testing startup Theranos at $9 billion last year. But a <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.wsj.com/articles/theranos-has-struggled-with-blood-tests-1444881901"">bombshell Wall Street Journal investigation</a> published last week has thrown the company into crisis by raising questions about whether its technology works as advertised.</p> \n<p>Theranos was founded by a Stanford dropout and is based in Silicon Valley, so people have <a href=""http://www.cnbc.com/2015/09/23/worlds-youngest-female-billionaire-next-steve-jobs.html"">naturally drawn comparisons</a> to tech industry legends — especially Apple co-founder Steve Jobs. But founder Elizabeth Holmes ignored a crucial piece of Silicon Valley conventional wisdom, and it may prove her undoing.</p> \n<p>The idea is that young startups should create a product and get it in front of customers as quickly as possible. Sure, the first product will have flaws and limitations, the argument goes, but there's nothing like real-world feedback to help drive improvement. Mark Zuckerberg, for example, began working on Facebook in January 2004, and had a working website <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2004/3/1/facebook-expands-beyond-harvard-harvard-students/"">operating across multiple campuses</a> by March. The site's rapid growth helped him raise $500,000 from investor Peter Thiel a few months later.</p> \n<h3>Theranos worked in secret for a decade</h3> \n<p>Theranos was started around the same time as Facebook — indeed, Holmes and Zuckerberg are the same age. But Theranos stayed in ""stealth mode"" —  not talking to the media or the public about what it was doing, to say nothing of releasing a working product — for a decade.</p> \n<p>That meant that by the time customers began using its blood test services in 2013, it had already raised more than $100 million from investors. The danger with this strategy is that if your original innovation has unexpected problems — and most innovations have unexpected problems — you don't find out about it until after you've wasted tens of millions of dollars. That seems to be the problem Theranos is facing today. And at this point, it may prove to be a really hard problem to solve.</p> \n<h3>Theranos made big claims it can't back up</h3> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4192203/shutterstock_139836592.0.jpg"" alt=""shutterstock_139836592.0.jpg"" data-chorus-asset-id=""4192203""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Theranos customers have to endure conventional veinous blood draws after all. (Tappasan Phurisamrit/Shutterstock)</p> \n<p>When Theranos first emerged from stealth mode in 2013, it made some ambitious claim for its product. As a <a href=""http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887324123004579055003869574012"">glowing 2013 profile</a> put it, Theranos was supposed to have ""devices that automate and miniaturize more than 1,000 laboratory tests, from routine blood work to advanced genetic analyses. Theranos's processes are faster, cheaper and more accurate than the conventional methods and require only microscopic blood volumes, not vial after vial of the stuff.""</p> \n<p>But in the past couple of weeks, many of these claims have been called into question. The company has <a href=""http://www.wsj.com/articles/theranos-ceo-company-is-in-a-pause-period-1445455992"">admitted</a> that right now only one Theranos test actually works with just a few drops of blood (others are currently being evaluated by regulators); dozens of others are conducted using the same ""vials after vial of the stuff"" that others labs use.</p> \n<p>The Journal notes that while it was reporting its big scoop on Theranos's technology, the company deleted a claim on its website that ""many of our tests require only a few drops of blood,"" replacing it with the much less impressive boast that it collects less blood from patients than competitors.</p> \n<h3>Theranos's proprietary technology doesn't live up to the hype</h3> \n<p>According to the Journal, Theranos was using its proprietary testing technology for only 15 tests at the end of 2014. The other 60 tests the company offered at the time were done using conventional laboratory equipment. (Theranos disputes these specific numbers, but it doesn't deny that it's been using conventional laboratory equipment for many of its tests, and has refused to say how many.)</p> \n<p><q class=""right"" aria-hidden=""true""><span>The company's culture of secrecy has likely cost its investors dearly</span></q></p> \n<p>The Journal's recent reporting also calls into question the accuracy of the Theranos tests. A big reason competing labs draw so much blood is that the machines they use often require it. But if Theranos is using the same conventional machines, it should need the same volume of blood as other testing companies — and one of Theranos's selling points is that its tests collect less blood than competitors. The Journal alleges that Theranos has dealt with this problem by diluting its samples, a process that can degrade the accuracy of the tests.</p> \n<p>Others have raised similar concerns. Jean-Louis Gassée, a prominent former Apple executive,<strong> </strong>says he <a href=""http://www.mondaynote.com/2015/10/18/theranos-trouble-a-first-person-account/"">tried Theranos for a test</a> he has to take regularly. He found that the results from the Theranos tests fluctuated a lot more than tests from a conventional lab.</p> \n<h3>A culture of secrecy set Theranos up for failure</h3> \n<p>Theranos has refused to provide details on how its testing regime works, so we can't be sure what's going on here. It's possible that the problems identified in recent reporting can be fixed, and that Theranos's new technology will eventually disrupt the medical testing industry.</p> \n<p>But the company's culture of secrecy has likely cost its investors dearly. If Theranos had taken a more open approach, it might have been able to start testing its technology — and opening it up to scientific peer review — years ago. That might have allowed the company to identify and fix problems while it was much smaller and less well-known, avoiding the massive public relations crisis it's suffering right now.</p> \n<p>On the other hand, if Theranos's technology can't be made to work as advertised, everyone involved would have benefited from discovering that a lot earlier. Holmes might have been able to ""pivot"" to a new technology or business model. And if not, investors could have avoided sinking tens of millions of dollars into a flawed technology.</p> \n<h3>Most Silicon Valley startups aren't like Theranos</h3> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4192173/GettyImages-462472160.0.jpg"" alt=""GettyImages-462472160.0.jpg"" data-chorus-asset-id=""4192173""></p> \n<p> </p> \n<p class=""caption"">Former Secretaries of State Henry Kissinger (left) and George Shultz are among the elderly former government officials on the Theranos board. (JIM WATSON/AFP/Getty Images)</p> \n<p> </p> \n<p>The fact that Holmes was producing a medical product rather than a software one likely gave her extra leeway to keep her technology under wraps for a decade. Medical technology has life-or-death implications, so it requires more rigorous testing than a social media website. Of course, that's exactly why the medical profession has a culture of rigorous, open peer review of new medical technology — a process Theranos has <a href=""http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=2110977"">largely refused</a> to participate in.</p> \n<p>Also, the Theranos board is conspicuously light on people who have experience with either biotechnology or startups. It contains a who's who of the military-industrial complex. Theranos's independent board members include former Secretaries of State George Shultz and Henry Kissinger, former Sens. Bill Frist and Sam Nunn, former Defense Secretary William Perry, retired Gen. James N. Mattis, and retired Adm. Gary Roughead.</p> \n<p>This is obviously a distinguished group, but it's not necessarily a great board for a biotechnology startup. In the world of defense contracting, it's not unusual to have secretive projects that cost tens of millions of dollars and take a decade to complete. But there was apparently no one on the board to point out that this approach doesn't work very well for technology startups.</p> \n<p>Most technology startups — and especially most technology startups that grow to be worth billions of dollars — do not stay in stealth mode for very long. We don't have to speculate on whether Uber, Airbnb, or other big, venture-funded technology companies have products that work. Their products have been in the market, and subject to intense scrutiny, for many years.</p> \n<p>There are some exceptions. For example, a company called Magic Leap has <a href=""http://www.theverge.com/2015/10/20/9579167/magic-leap-manufacturing"">raised more than $500 million from investors</a> for its virtual reality technology, which has yet to be publicly unveiled. Its leading competitor, Oculus VR, was <a href=""http://www.theverge.com/2014/3/25/5547456/facebook-buying-oculus-for-2-billion"">acquired by Facebook</a> for $2 billion in 2014 — it also has yet to release its product to the public. Creating a new category of consumer products is harder than creating a new website, so it's not surprising that it's taken these companies more than a few months to bring their products to market.</p> \n<p>But neither company has been in stealth mode for nearly as long as Theranos was — Magic Leap was founded in 2010, and Oculus VR has only been around since 2012. If these companies are still struggling to get their technology to work in 2020, their investors should be worried.</p>",Business & Finance
Why Janet Yellen should ignore the experts and listen to this naive farmer,http://www.vox.com/2015/10/25/9605162/fed-interest-rates-farmer,A New York Times writer argues that youâ€™re not supposed to understand the Federal Reserve. But right now the commonsense answer is correct.,"<p>In a piece for today's New York Times Magazine, Planet Money's Adam Davidson <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/25/magazine/youre-not-supposed-to-understand-the-federal-reserve.html"">tells the story</a> of Rick Stern, a farmer who is worried that higher interest rates will hurt him financially. Higher interest rates will mean a stronger dollar, which will make US crops less competitive on world markets. It will also make it more expensive for the farmer to borrow money to invest in his farm. So, Davidson concludes, Stern ""just wishes the Fed would leave rates alone, and he can’t understand why they would even consider raising them.""</p> \n<p>""It’s politics,"" Stern tells Davidson. ""Most politicians forget who they are and why they went to Washington.""</p> \n<p>But Davidson says our system is designed to ensure that people like Stern <em>can't</em> influence the Fed's decisions. ""If the Fed added up all the ways a rate increase helped people in the short term and subtracted all the ways it hurt them, they would never raise rates,"" he argues. Yet if the Fed never raised rates, the result would be high rates of inflation. So Davidson argues that even though low interest rates would be better for Stern — and millions of other Americans — in the short run, it's a good thing that the Fed is empowered to raise rates anyway.</p> \n<p>I think this actually gets things backward. In recent years, the political dynamic has generally cut in the opposite direction: The Fed has faced far more criticism from <a href=""http://thinkprogress.org/politics/2011/08/15/296552/perry-on-bernanke-pretty-ugly-down-in-texas/"">monetary hawks on the political right</a> — who believed the Fed was keeping rates too low — than from doves pushing for more expansionary policies.</p> \n<p>Right now, in fact, the Fed is under significant political pressure to raise rates. That's despite the fact that the inflation rate is currently <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/9/12/9313209/brazil-inflation-interest-rates"" target=""_blank"">below the Fed's 2 percent target</a> — which would normally be considered a sign that interest rates are too high.</p> \n<p>One reason for that, however, is that many mainstream pundits have adopted Davidson's view that monetary policy is too complicated for ordinary people to understand. The result of this isn't to free the Fed's technocrats to make decisions without political pressure. Instead, it amplifies the influence of people on the political fringes, most of whom currently believe the Fed has done too much to support the economy.</p> \n<p>But the hawks are wrong, and the commonsense perspective of that farmer is right. Higher interest rates slow the economy, and with inflation at very low levels, there's no good reason to do that. And if ordinary people want to see the economy continue to boom, they might want to make their views known to policymakers.</p>",Business & Finance
How Uber could get a lot bigger than people think,http://www.vox.com/2015/10/26/9616986/uber-google-self-driving,"Uber is rumored to be worth $70 billion, but it could become a lot more valuable.","<p>Yesterday I <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/12/4/7336433/uber-worth-"">made the case</a> that Uber could wind up being a bigger deal than many people think — that Uber could not only come to dominate the taxi business, but could expand the market for taxi services as well. But evaluating Uber as a player in the taxi market could underestimate the company's growth potential.</p> \n<p>To see why, imagine it's 2000 and you're trying to predict how big Google can get. Well, you might have tried to estimate this by looking at the size of existing services that help people find information: the Yellow Pages, encyclopedias, library card catalogs, and so forth. But of course, Google wasn't just a new kind of card catalog or a better Yellow Pages. Rather, it became the default way that people found all kinds of information online.</p> \n<p>The bullish case for Uber assumes that (as I've <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/5/28/5758560/driverless-cars-will-mean-the-end-of-car-ownership"">argued before</a>) self-driving cars will render consumer car ownership obsolete. In a world where renting cars is the norm and buying them is the exception, the services people use to find cars for rent are going to have a lot of power. And Uber has a good shot at dominating this market in much the same way it dominates the smartphone-based taxi market today.</p> \n<h3>Uber is well-positioned to dominate the self-driving car market</h3> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""4095918"" alt=""google self-driving car"" src=""https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4095918/google-aev-prototype.jpg""></p> \n<p>Even if self-driving car rentals will be a big market, that doesn't necessarily prove that Uber in particular will dominate that market. But Uber has some advantages that no other companies can really match.</p> \n<p>There are two different types of companies that might compete with Uber to build apps to hail self-driving cars: tech companies like Google and Apple and car companies like Ford and Toyota. But neither type of company is as well-positioned as Uber to build a popular app for hailing self-driving cars.</p> \n<p>The car companies' weaknesses are obvious: They are not in the software business, and <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/2/23/8092141/silicon-valley-dominate-cars"">non-software companies often struggle</a> when Silicon Valley invades their turf. There's a reason that Apple, not the recording industry, popularized digital music. There's a reason YouTube and Netflix, not Hollywood studios, dominate the online streaming business. It'll be hard enough for car companies to make their cars full self-driving; creating a user-friendly car-hailing app and building all the digital and physical infrastructure required to support such a service will be an even bigger struggle.</p> \n<p>Google will be a bigger threat, since it obviously does know how to build user-friendly apps and large-scale network services. But Google is likely to struggle with other aspects of operating a self-driving car service.</p> \n<p>Running a transportation network requires a lot of communications with both regulators and customers. Google has generally avoided products with customer service needs — when's the last time you called Google for help with your Gmail account? And while the company has a large lobbying presence in Washington, it doesn't have nearly as much experience as Uber at dealing with officials in dozens of cities around the globe.</p> \n<p>And while Uber has a reputation for flouting local regulations, its relationship with cities is gradually improving as cities become more accommodating. By the time self-driving cars arrive sometime in the 2020s, we can expect Uber to have deep and generally friendly relationships with local officials around the world. Those relationships will be extremely valuable as Uber tries to convince those same officials to allow self-driving cars on their roads.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, Google's most ambitious foray into a labor-intensive transportation service — Google Express — <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://recode.net/2015/08/19/google-express-plans-to-shut-down-its-two-delivery-hubs/"">hasn't been doing very well</a>. Managing people and physical infrastructure is a different skill than tackling hard technical problems, and Google just isn't very good at it.</p> \n<p>A similar point applies to Apple, which is working on its own automotive products. Apple has <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/6/2/5773688/why-icloud-drive-will-probably-be-a-flop"">struggled</a> to produce reliable network services like Apple Maps, it's never shown much interest in the lobbying game, and it's never even tried to build large-scale physical infrastructure. Apple may be able to build a great self-driving car, but it probably wouldn't be good at managing a huge fleet of them.</p> \n<p>All of which means that both Google and Apple might be happy to partner with a company like Uber to handle the boring logistical details of building a ride-hailing app, managing a network of vehicles, and handling complaints from regulators and customers. And if not, Uber's deep experience in these areas gives it a good shot at out-competing the tech companies — perhaps in partnership with carmakers.</p> \n<h3>A dominant self-driving car service would be huge</h3> \n<p>So if you want to figure out how big Uber could get, looking at the taxi market is way too narrow. Uber is vying to become the standard app that everyone — not just urban elites, but ordinary people in suburbs and small towns too — uses when they want to move around town.</p> \n<p>To figure out how big that could be, you want to look at the automotive industry as a whole. Consumers currently spend hundreds of billions of dollars with these companies, and they'll likely continue spending hundreds of billions of dollars on in-town transportation in the future. If Uber plays its cards right, it could be come an indispensable middleman that can take a cut of every transaction.</p> \n<p>And the service might not stop with moving people around. There are likely to be self-driving alternatives to FedEx, Domino's, and other delivery services. The company that manages the dominant network of self-driving cars for people would be well-positioned to manage self-driving delivery vehicles too.</p> \n<p>If Uber does succeed in building the dominant self-driving ride-hailing app, it will make the company's <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/24/business/dealbook/uber-said-to-plan-another-1-billion-in-fund-raising.html"" target=""_blank"">rumored $70 billion valuation</a> look downright puny.</p> \n<p><span><b>Disclosure:</b></span><span> My </span><a href=""https://twitter.com/startupandrew"" target=""_blank"">brother</a><span> is an </span><a href=""https://www.firebase.com/blog/2014-10-21-firebase-joins-google.html"" target=""_blank"">executive</a><span> at Google.</span></p> \n<hr> \n<h3>VIDEO: The economics of being a driver for hire</h3> \n<!--  ########  BEGIN VOLUME VIDEO  ########  --> \n<div class=""volume-video"" id=""volume-placement-903"" data-volume-placement=""article"" data-analytics-placement=""article:middle"" data-volume-id=""255"" data-volume-uuid=""07d83338f"" data-analytics-label=""The math of being a Lyft driver | 255"" data-analytics-action=""volume:view:article:middle"" data-analytics-viewport=""video""></div> \n<!--  ########  END VOLUME VIDEO  ########  -->",Business & Finance
No one knows what will happen if the Silicon Valley boom ends,http://www.vox.com/2015/10/27/9617996/silicon-valley-boom-fragile,More and more people think there's a bubble in Silicon Valley.,"<p>Worries about a financial bubble in Silicon Valley are growing. In a <a href=""http://www.wsj.com/articles/the-dangers-ahead-if-tech-unicorns-get-gored-1445832492"">Monday piece</a> for the Wall Street Journal, Christopher Mims compares the current crop of dozens of <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/9/11/9306533/silicon-valley-bubble-no"" target=""_blank"">""unicorns""</a> — tech companies worth more than a billion dollars but not traded on any stock market — to the subprime mortgage market a decade ago.</p> \n<p>He argues that the same kind of complex, opaque financial engineering that caused people to overestimate the value of mortgage-backed securities a decade ago may be inflating the value of technology startups today. And he worries it will lead to the same kind of financial meltdown.</p> \n<p>If the pessimists are right, the technology implosion of 2016 won't look like the one that started in 2000. That's because the market has changed a lot since the 1990s. Back then, companies tried to offer their shares to the public as quickly as possible. That meant people could watch the stocks of duds like Pets.com, Webvan, and eToys crater in realtime.</p> \n<p>But today's hottest startups aren't traded on any public stock market. With more rich people around, it's easier than it used to be to raise money in a few big chunks from private investors. So the bubble — if there is a bubble — is mostly in companies whose stock is closely held.</p> \n<p>The good news here is that this means ordinary investors are less likely to be burned. Joe Investor can't lose money on overvalued tech stocks because he never had a chance to buy them in the first place. The bad news, though, is that the proliferation of gigantic, privately held companies could make Silicon Valley as a whole more brittle.</p> \n<h3>There's growing talk of a technology bubble</h3> \n<p>When I visited the San Francisco Bay Area in May, everyone was talking about whether there was a tech bubble (and also, not coincidentally, about how expensive San Francisco real estate was). Since then, bubble talk has only gotten more common.</p> \n<p>Last week the <a href=""http://www.wsj.com/articles/tech-startups-feel-an-ipo-chill-1445309822"">Wall Street Journal reported</a> there was a ""chill"" among private companies trying to offer their stocks to the public for the first time. Some privately held companies have been finding that they can't get investors in the public market to pay as much for their stock as the<strong> </strong>companies<strong> </strong>were expecting. That could be a sign that the private market is getting out of whack.</p> \n<p><q class=""right"" aria-hidden=""true""><span>The tightly knit and closed-door venture capital market can be prone to mood swings</span></q></p> \n<p>But the Journal's evidence was highly anecdotal, focusing on a handful of startups with disappointing fundraising efforts. That might signal that technology stocks are overvalued, generally. But it might just reflect that those specific companies aren't doing well.</p> \n<p>The respected venture capitalist Fred Wilson <a href=""http://avc.com/2015/10/negative-gross-margins/"">argues</a> that one big problem is that companies are spending one another into huge losses in an effort to capture new markets. He points particularly to a new wave of new smartphone-based delivery apps (he didn't mention any specific companies, but Instacart and Blue Apron are two well-known examples) that seem to be offering their services at below-market rates. This obviously can't last, and Wilson predicts that some will run out of money in the next year or two.</p> \n<h3>Privately held startups can be fragile</h3> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""4200725"">\n<img src=""https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4200725/GettyImages-1324206.jpg""> \n<div class=""caption"">Webvan was one of the biggest failures of the first dot-com boom.</div> \n</div> \n<p>Taking a company public has some real downsides. Last year investor Marc Andreessen <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/6/26/5837638/the-ipo-is-dying-marc-andreessen-explains-why"">told me</a> that when you run a public company, speculators can ""bat your stock around like it's a chew toy"" and that volatile stock prices can be bad for the morale of employees who are compensated with stock options.</p> \n<p>Also, public companies face more regulation now, thanks to the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarbanes%E2%80%93Oxley_Act"">2002 Sarbanes-Oxley Act</a>, than they did in the 1990s. And public companies are increasingly targeted by <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activist_shareholder"">activist investors</a> who buy up a company's stock and then try to force its management to change how they do business.</p> \n<p>But it also has a huge upside: You always know exactly where you stand, and you can easily raise more capital if you need it. Anytime a public company needs more cash, it can sell stock on the open market, getting the current market price.</p> \n<p>By contrast, private companies raise cash in huge fundraising rounds that usually happen every year or two. If the company is doing well, each round will fetch a higher price than the one before, allowing earlier investors to make a healthy return and boosting employee morale. But if the opposite happens — known as a ""down round"" — it can be devastating. Not only is a declining value bad for previous investors, but it can shake the confidence of employees (who are often compensated with stock options) and customers, who might wonder if the company will still be around in a couple of years.</p> \n<p>Because a down round can be so devastating, companies work hard to avoid them. That might mean delaying a much-needed round of fundraising in hopes of getting a better price later. And Mims says that some companies have been offering investors ever more favorable terms in an effort to inflate their paper stock values and keep up the illusion of upward momentum.</p> \n<p>All of this means that the private venture capital market may be brittle. Public stock markets, of course, are prone to irrational swings due to investor psychology. But the tightly knit and closed-door venture capital market can be even more prone to mood swings. It could just take a few failures by overvalued ""unicorns"" for the venture capital world to reevaluate their entire portfolios and decide that many are overvalued.</p> \n<h3>No one knows what will happen if the venture capital market implodes</h3> \n<p>In the past, it was rare for a venture-backed tech company to stay private for more than a few years. Either it would grow rapidly and become a publicly traded company (or be acquired by one), or it would flame out and go out of business. Silicon Valley has never had so many companies that are as large as conventional public companies but still privately held. We don't know how Silicon Valley will cope if there's a broad downturn in the value of these big, privately held technology stocks.</p> \n<p>The optimistic view is that a downturn among private technology stocks will just mean a bunch of rich people (as well as some pension funds and university endowments) will lose money. Ordinary investors aren't allowed to invest in venture capital markets, so they won't be directly harmed the way many investors were harmed by the bursting of the dot-com bubble at the turn of the century.</p> \n<p>Also, while some companies are struggling, others may still be doing well — so perhaps we'll see a wave of failing companies alongside others that continue to thrive.</p> \n<p>But the pessimistic view holds that an imploding technology bubble could bring down technology companies in general — and perhaps other parts of the US economy as well. This is where the analogy to the housing markets gets scary. In theory, there was no reason falling housing prices in 2007 should have triggered a global financial crisis in 2008. But the economy is interconnected, and if venture capital firms start losing boatloads of money, it could cause a broader financial retrenchment.</p> \n<p>And unfortunately, we don't really know when — or even if — a technology downturn will happen. Private companies only get valued when they raise money, and most companies only do that every year or two. So there's no index of private company technology stocks we can watch to see if it's falling. We just have to wait and see.</p>",Business & Finance
"How Apple became the world's most valuable company, explained",http://www.vox.com/2015/10/28/9626810/apple-iphone-profits-explained,The iPhone is making Apple huge profits around the world.,"<p>Apple is the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_public_corporations_by_market_capitalization"">world's most valuable company</a> by a wide margin, and on Tuesday it released financial results that demonstrated why its stock is valued so highly by investors. Apple reported profits of $11 billion for the quarter that ended in September on revenue of $51.5 billion. That's more than the combined profits of Google ($4.7 billion) and Microsoft ($5.8 billion) — two companies that are, by any normal standard, huge engines of profit. And the year's biggest profits are yet to come, as Apple always posts the best financial results over the holiday shopping season.</p> \n<p>What has allowed Apple to deliver such spectacular financial results quarter after quarter is the staggering success of the iPhone, arguably the single most commercially successful product of all time. The iPhone allows Apple to stand in a class of its own in the smartphone world. Android-powered phones are, collectively, very popular, but companies making them have struggled to make a profit in the face of fierce competition and falling prices. Apple has actually seen average iPhone prices <em>rise</em>, allowing Cupertino to enjoy 39.9 percent profit margins — an unheard-of sum for a product in a competitive market.</p> \n<p>And Apple expects to have many more quarters of strong economic performance. Not only will loyal customers in rich countries want to upgrade to the latest model every two or three years, but Apple sees big opportunities in China and other developing countries. Right now most Chinese consumers simply can't afford the high price of an iPhone. But Apple's Chinese sales have been growing rapidly — nearly doubling over the past year — and as China's economy develops, Apple is expecting the flood of new customers to continue.</p> \n<h3>Apple is mostly an iPhone company</h3> \n<p>To understand why Apple is such a huge and profitable company, you really only have to look at a single product: the iPhone. The iPhone accounted for 62 percent of all Apple revenue last quarter, and as Apple has become more successful, the phone has become more and more important to Apple's bottom line.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""right""><span>As iPhones get more expensive, they're getting more lucrative too</span></q></p> \n<p>Apple sold 48 million iPhones in the quarter that ended in September, generating $32 billion in revenue. That's up from 39 million iPhones and $24 billion in revenue in the same quarter of 2014.</p> \n<p>Not only is Apple selling more iPhone than ever, but it's making more money on them too. Apple has managed to raise the average price of the iPhones it sells — likely because customers are opting for models with bigger screens or more storage space. The average sale price of an iPhone during the last quarter was $670, up $67 from the same quarter a year ago.</p> \n<p>Apple hasn't disclosed its profit margins on iPhones specifically, but teardowns have suggested that a $749 iPhone 6s Plus may <a href=""http://recode.net/2015/09/29/apples-iphone-6s-plus-costs-an-estimated-236-to-make-749-to-purchase/"" target=""_blank"">cost as little as $236</a> to assemble. Andthe company disclosed that its overall gross margin — how much revenue is left after subtracting manufacturing costs for all Apple products — is 39.9 percent. That compares with 38 percent a year ago and 37 percent two years ago.</p> \n<p>For any other company, Apple's other offerings — Macs, iPads, iTunes, Apple Watches, and so forth — would be considered big and successful products. Apple sold 9.8 million iPads and 5.7 million Macs. But this is a sideshow compared with the 48 million iPhones.</p> \n<h3>The iPhone stands in a class by itself</h3> \n<p>The rising price and profitability of iPhones is particularly impressive because the price of Android phones has been <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/amitchowdhry/2015/02/03/average-iphone-price-increases-to-687-and-android-decreases-to-254-says-report/"">moving in the opposite direction</a>.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""right""><span>At the high end of the market, Android companies have been struggling</span></q></p> \n<p>The smartphone market is increasingly becoming two distinct submarkets. At the low end of the market — phones that cost $300 or less — Android phones are totally dominant. Indeed, because cheaper phones account for most smartphones sold, Android controls 82 percent of the overall smartphone market.</p> \n<p>But at the high end of the market, Android companies have been struggling. While Apple has been selling more iPhones at higher prices, the sales and profits of high-end Android phones from companies like Samsung and HTC have been disappointing. Customers in the market for a luxury phone are increasingly opting for the most glamorous smartphone brand of all: Apple.</p> \n<p>And there are signs that this bifurcation of the market — between iPhones for affluent customers and Android phones for everyone else — could become self-perpetuating. For example, I've owned Android phones for the past couple of years, and I've noticed that new apps are often developed for the iPhone first. On paper, there are a lot more Android users than iPhone users. But iPhone users are disproportionately wealthy, educated, and technologically sophisticated, so app developers have an incentive to cater to them first.</p> \n<p>Apple also enjoys economies of scale that few of its Android competitors can match. Because Apple sells tens of millions of iPhones every quarter, it can commit to buying components at a massive scale, allowing it to negotiate big volume discounts.</p> \n<p>You might expect that the impressive profitability of the iPhone would attract imitators, but creating a luxury smartphone platform is a lot harder than creating a luxury handbag or watch. Android-based vendors have trouble setting themselves apart when they're all based on the same software platform. And creating a new smartphone platform from scratch — and attracting the thousands of developers who would make it useful — is extremely difficult.</p> \n<h3>Apple is having huge success in China</h3> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""4206769"" alt=""GettyImages-489507702.0.jpg"" src=""https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4206769/GettyImages-489507702.0.jpg""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">(ChinaFotoPress/ChinaFotoPress via Getty Images)</p> \n<p>North America continues to be Apple's biggest market, but most of Apple's growth has come from ""Greater China"" — which includes Taiwan and Hong Kong. Apple's sales in China last quarter were $12.5 billion, nearly double what the company made in China a year earlier.</p> \n<p>Apple's status as a luxury brand is even more pronounced in China than it is in the United States. For an ordinary American, $670 is a lot to pay for a smartphone. It's an even bigger outlay for the average person in China, where the per capita income is only about $7,000. In China, an iPhone is a luxury item like a Gucci handbag or a Cartier watch.</p> \n<p>In a call following Tuesday's earnings report, <a href=""http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2015/10/27/apples-q4-earnings-iphone-ipad-china-and-more-live-blog/"">Apple CEO Tim Cook argued</a> that Apple was well-positioned for further growth in China. He expects China's middle class to grow by a factor of 10 in the coming years, and as new customers enter the middle class, Apple will be able to sell them iPhones, iPads, and other Apple products.</p> \n<h3>Apple has more money than it knows what to do with</h3> \n<p>Apple has generated billions of dollars in profits every quarter for many years now. As a result, the company has accumulated a <a href=""http://files.shareholder.com/downloads/AAPL/183891207x0x840254/7137D28C-2E6E-4406-8435-ADAB52BB6F4C/Return_of_Capital_Timeline_Q415.pdf"">mountain of cash</a> — $206 billion in total, largely held by Apple's foreign subsidiaries to minimize the corporate income tax bill. This is by far the largest cash stockpile in the world. For context, there are only <a href=""http://www.dogsofthedow.com/largest-companies-by-market-cap.htm"">15 companies in the entire world whose total value exceeds $206 billion</a>.</p> \n<p>An obvious thing to do with that money is to give it back to Apple's shareholders. Earlier this year, <a href=""https://www.apple.com/pr/library/2015/04/27Apple-Expands-Capital-Return-Program-to-200-Billion.html"">Apple vowed</a> to spend $200 billion on dividends and share buybacks, and it has already returned $143 billion in cash to shareholders. The more than $206 billion Apple has now is <em>on top</em> of money it has already pushed out to shareholders.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""center""><span>There is an inherent limit to the number of innovative ideas Cook and his team can conceive and execute on</span></q></p> \n<p>The other thing Apple could do with its cash reserves is to invest them in new products and services. And the company is doing some of that too. The rumored <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/2/19/8070871/apple-car-hiring-spree"">Apple Car</a> is one such project. We don't know how far Apple has gotten in its development process, but if it does decide to bring a car to market, it could cost many billions of dollars to do so.</p> \n<p>Still, there is an inherent limit to the number of innovative ideas Cook and his team can conceive and execute on. So as Apple's cash pile continues to grow, Cook will face pressure to give even more back to shareholders and to <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/10/21/9583646/carl-icahn-super-pac"">lobby for changes to tax law</a> that will allow this to be done without giving Uncle Sam an enormous cut.</p>",Business & Finance
Bitcoin's value is surging. Here are 5 charts on the growing Bitcoin economy.,http://www.vox.com/technology/2015/10/31/9651168/bitcoin-growing,Bitcoin's value has soared more than 30 percent since the start of November.,"<p>Bitcoin hasn't received the kind of hype in 2015 that it has in previous years. But outside the spotlight, the Bitcoin economy has continued to grow slowly but steadily. And in the last few weeks, the value of Bitcoin has soared. One bitcoin cost $236 at the beginning of October. Now, five weeks later, it costs $426.</p> \n<p>No one is sure why the currency has had such a dramatic surge. But it's at least partly a sign of growing investor confidence in the growth of the underlying Bitcoin economy. <span>Here are five charts that show Bitcoin's progress.</span></p> \n<h3>1) Bitcoin's price is at its highest level of the year</h3> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""4227955"" alt=""chart.0.png"" src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4227955/chart.0.png""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">(<a target=""_blank"" href=""http://bitcoincharts.com/charts/bitstampUSD#czsg2015-01-01zeg2015-11-05ztgSzm1g10zm2g25"">Bitcoincharts.com</a>)</p> \n<p>One bitcoin was worth around $320 at the start of 2015, and it was below that level for most of the year. But last Friday, it rose above $320, and then shot up to more than $420 in the last couple of days.</p> \n<p>To be sure, this is far from the currency's all-time record: One bitcoin was worth more than $1,000 in late 2013, and it lost 60 percent of its value in 2014. But the past few weeks' boom suggests that after months of growing pessimism, Bitcoin speculators are becoming more optimistic again.</p> \n<h3>2) People are performing more Bitcoin transactions than ever</h3> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""4214451""><img src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4214451/bitcoin_transactions.png""></div> \n<p>The best way to estimate Bitcoin's long-term growth isn't by its price — which is hugely affected by speculation and media hype — but by the volume of transactions on the Bitcoin network. Over the long run, a growing volume of Bitcoin transactions is a strong signal that people are finding the network more and more useful. And this year we've seen steady — though not spectacular — growth in the number of bitcoin transactions.</p> \n<p>This growing transaction volume is a healthy sign for Bitcoin, but it's also a potential problem, because right now the network has an artificial limit on the total number of transactions it can handle. The network will hit this limit in a couple of years if changes aren't made to the Bitcoin software — and the Bitcoin community has <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/8/18/9168977/bitcoin-constitutional-crisis"">yet to reach an agreement</a> about what to do about this.</p> \n<h3>3) Venture capitalists continue to invest in Bitcoin</h3> \n<p> </p> \n<div id=""vox-bitcoin-investments__graphic"" data-analytics-viewport=""autotune"" data-analytics-class=""embed""></div> \n<p> \n<script src=""//apps.voxmedia.com/at/vox-bitcoin-investments/javascripts/pym-4fbcbea1.js"" type=""text/javascript""></script> \n<script type=""text/javascript""><!-- \nnew pym.Parent('vox-bitcoin-investments__graphic', '//apps.voxmedia.com/at/vox-bitcoin-investments/', {xdomain: '.*\\.voxmedia\\.com'}); \n// --></script> \n</p> \n<p> </p> \n<p>Bitcoin hasn't received nearly as much attention from the media this year as it did in 2013, but Bitcoin-based startups continue to be of great interest to venture capitalists. With two months remaining in the year, there has already been $468 million invested in Bitcoin startups — more investment than in any previous year. Bitcoin has yet to break into the mainstream, but a lot of investors are betting it will do so soon.</p> \n<h3>4) Bitcoin is becoming increasingly international</h3> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""4216597""><img src=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4216597/BitPay1-1438718142150.png""></div> \n<p>This chart from the Bitcoin startup Bitpay shows how its business has grown in various parts of the world. Bitpay helps merchants accept Bitcoin payments. Like most Bitcoin startups, Bitpay is based in the United States, so its business was originally skewed toward the US. But recently that's been changing. Europe zoomed ahead of the United States in the first half of 2015, and Latin America has seen rapid growth.</p> \n<p>This might be because in many ways the US is the least promising market for Bitcoin. One of the big promises of the technology is that Bitcoin could serve as a global standard, allowing people in different countries to interact. That's not a very strong selling proposition in the United States, which is a single integrated market where people tend to all use the same payment methods.</p> \n<p>But Bitpay says that despite the euro, ""traditional payments systems in Europe are still very localized and disjointed throughout the continent."" The same is true in Latin America. In areas where people are used to juggling many different payment methods, adding Bitcoin to the list is an easier sell.</p> \n<h3>5) The number of Bitcoin ATMs is growing</h3> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""4216573""><img src=""https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4216573/Screen%20Shot%202015-10-30%20at%205.19.15%20PM.png""></div> \n<p>A Bitcoin ATM looks much like a conventional ATM. It allows people to insert dollars (or other local currencies) and get bitcoins in exchange. Some machines also allow the opposite: Customers can send bitcoins to the machine and get cash.</p> \n<p>This provides a key bit of infrastructure for the Bitcoin ecosystem, because it means that anyone who wants some bitcoins can get them easily. Among other applications, these machines provide an alternative to conventional money-transfer services like Western Union: Someone can put cash into an ATM in New York and send bitcoins to a family member in Argentina or Thailand, who can then use another machine to get out the local currency.</p> \n<p>However, right now Bitcoin ATMs are too expensive for this to be practical. Average fees are around 5 percent on each end of the transaction, so using them as a Bitcoin-based money transfer service costs about 10 percent — more than a conventional money transfer service. Bitcoin ATM owners will need to bring these fees down if they want the machines to be more widely used.</p>",Business & Finance
America has never seen so few empty hotel rooms,http://www.vox.com/2015/11/2/9657978/hotel-vacancy-rate,The recovery meets a construction jobs bust.,"<p>From all the hype and trend pieces around Airbnb and other online room-rental platforms, you might have the impression that the hotel industry is in some kind of severe slump. But as this great chart from Bill McBride and Calculated Risk shows, exactly the opposite is the case.</p> \n<p>America has never had so few vacant hotel rooms:</p> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""4218513""><img src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4218513/HotelsOct2015.PNG""></div> \n<p>So what's behind this?</p> \n<p>Well, first and foremost it's the ongoing recovery from the Great Recession. There are more people alive today than there were in 2007 or 2000, so even though the labor market isn't as tight as it was in those peak years, there are more total employed people.</p> \n<p>But the second factor is that we've had very little new hotel construction in the past few years. That largely speaks to both the severity of the recession and its specific nature arising in the construction and construction-finance sectors. And that's why the hotel room shortage ultimately <em>should</em> turn out to be good news for the broader economy. It's clear at this point that there are markets in the United States where it would be profitable to build more hotels, which would mean more construction jobs in the short term and more hospitality employment in the longer term.</p>",Business & Finance
What Ralph Nader and Ben Carson don't get about interest rates,http://www.vox.com/2015/11/2/9660042/federal-reserve-ben-carson,Both men believe the Fed is hurting ordinary Americans by keeping interest rates low.,"<p>People on both the left and the right are arguing that the Federal Reserve is hurting savers by keeping interest rates low.</p> \n<p>On the left, there's Ralph Nader, who recently <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/ralph-nader/an-open-letter-to-chairwo_b_8438486.html?1446247344"">wrote a polemic</a> from ""Savers of America"" arguing that Fed policies constituted a massive transfer of wealth from ordinary Americans to big banks.</p> \n<p>From the right, <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonkblog/wp/2015/11/02/why-ben-carson-says-america-is-doing-a-horrible-job-helping-the-poor/"">Ben Carson argues</a> that low interest rates hurt ""poor people and the middle class,"" who used to be able to accumulate wealth with a savings account.</p> \n<p>This line of argument clearly has intuitive appeal since it is popping up in diverse situations, but it actually makes very little sense. For one thing, a lot of ""poor people and the middle class"" borrow more than they save, so low interest rates are actually good for them. But more fundamentally, if the Fed were to raise interest rates aggressively and prematurely, it would be a disaster for everyone.</p> \n<h3>Low interest rates can be good for ordinary people</h3> \n<p>The most obvious problem with the Nader and Carson arguments is that they ignore the fact that ordinary people don't just save money, they borrow it too. If you've bought a house in the past few years, you probably benefited from today's exceptionally low interest rates. If you bought a house 10 or 20 years ago, you probably benefited from being able to refinance your mortgage in the past few years. That's thousands of dollars in lost income for the big banks Nader loathes so much.</p> \n<p>People used to understand that low interest rates are good for ordinary people. Back in the 1990s, politicians would frequently argue that we needed to cut the deficit in order to bring interest rates down. Low interest rates make it easier for people to buy houses and cars, borrow money to start a business, pay for their student loans, and so forth.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""right""><span>People used to understand that low interest rates are good for ordinary people</span></q></p> \n<p>At the same time, anyone who's saving for retirement by putting cash in a savings account is making a big mistake — whether interest rates are currently high <em>or</em> low. Experts advise people to put their retirement savings into a <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/7/31/5882885/retirement-planning-saving-how-much-do-i-need"">diversified portfolio of stocks and bonds</a>. History suggests that this kind of portfolio is likely to outperform a conventional savings account over the long run — and it's not as tied to short-term interest rate moves by the Fed.</p> \n<h3>The Fed has less control over interest rates than you think</h3> \n<p>The broader problem with Nader and Carson's arguments is that the Fed doesn't actually have that much control over interest rates.</p> \n<p>Think of a guy driving along a winding mountain road. In one sense, he has total control over where the car goes. If he turns the steering wheel to the right, the car goes right. But that doesn't mean he can drive the car wherever he wants. If he steers too far to the right, he'll go through the guardrail and off the cliff. If he steers too far to the left, he'll run into the mountain on the other side of the road.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""center""><span>The Fed doesn't have that much leeway to raise rates if it wants to avoid hurtling over the cliff and into a big recession</span></q></p> \n<p>The Fed is in a similar situation. It's trying to steer a course between the twin evils of inflation and recession. If it keeps rates too low for too long, the economy will start to overheat, and inflation will get out of control. If the Fed raises rates too quickly, it'll tip the economy back into recession. So it's true that at any particular instant, the Fed can make interest rates go up and down. But the Fed doesn't have that much leeway to raise rates if it wants to avoid hurtling over the cliff and into a big recession.</p> \n<p>The European Central Bank did exactly that when it <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/jul/07/ebc-raise-interest-rates-debt-crisis"">raised interest rates prematurely</a> in 2011. That proved to be a huge mistake, because it tipped the eurozone economy into a double-dip recession. Countries like Greece and Spain are still feeling the pain today.</p> \n<p>A key thing to notice here is that the ECB didn't just damage Europe's economy with its interest rate hike, it wasn't even able to keep interest rates up for very long. Before the end of the year, it became obvious that the higher rates were hurting the economy. <a href=""http://www.wsj.com/articles/ecb-cuts-interest-rates-in-surprise-move-1409832304"">The ECB was forced to reverse itself</a> and return interest rates to their previous level. Today rates are even lower than they were in 2011, and that year's premature interest rate hike is part of the reason.</p> \n<p>So if you want higher interest rates in the long term, you should be rooting for the Fed not to make the ECB's mistake. Low rates accelerate the economy, getting us more quickly to a point where the economy is healthy enough that private demand for capital pushes rates upward.</p>",Business & Finance
Why Google and car companies are about to spend billions mapping American roads,http://www.vox.com/2016/4/22/11476636/self-driving-car-maps,Self-driving cars will be a job boom for digital mapmakers.,"<p>Are fully functional self-driving cars right around the corner? After years of optimism, we're <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2016/4/21/11447838/self-driving-cars-challenges-obstacles"">starting to see people wonder</a> if they might be further away than people thought. And skeptics point to mapping as a key obstacle.</p> \n<p>Writing at the Marginal Revolution blog, for example, <a href=""http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2016/01/when-will-self-driving-cars-be-a-real-thing.html"">economist Tyler Cowen argues</a> that ""mapping the territory, reliably, will remain the key problem. Until that is solved, driverless cars will be a form of mass transit — except without the mass — along predesignated routes.""</p> \n<p>Creating detailed and comprehensive maps is difficult in the sense that it takes a lot of work, but it's not a hard technical problem. Google has already done it for roads around their corporate headquarters in Mountain View and some of its competitors likely already have the same capabilities. Expanding these maps nationally doesn't require a conceptual breakthrough, it just takes money — and Google has a lot of money.</p> \n<p>We can expect Google and its rivals to start their mapping projects in major cities where the bulk of Americans live. That means that most of us are likely to get access to door-to-door self-driving car service long before the last mile of rural American roads has been mapped.</p> \n<h3>Google's cars drive freestyle</h3> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""6372281"">\n<img src=""https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6372281/462675874.jpg""> \n<div class=""caption"">Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx meets with Google chair Eric Schmidt and Google's self-driving car chief Chris Urmson.</div> \n</div> \n<p>Computers have been able to beat human beings at chess since 1997, when the IBM's Deep Blue beat human champ Garry Kasparov. But in his 2013 book <em><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Average-Is-Over-Powering-Stagnation/dp/0525953736"">Average Is Over</a></em>, economist Tyler Cowen pointed out that (at least at the time he was writing) mixed teams of humans and computers — known as freestyle chess teams — were even better at chess than computer software alone. Humans provided valuable strategic insights to complement the massive computing power of the machines.</p> \n<p>Google's self-driving car technology works on the same principle. A computer inside the car is responsible for making second-by-second driving decisions. But the car is in constant contact with Google headquarters, where a large team of human analysts — backed up by the vast computing power of Google's data centers — maintains an extremely accurate, detailed, and up-to-date map of the streets where Google's cars are driving.</p> \n<p>Google described its effort to build this map in its <a href=""https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/www.google.com/en//selfdrivingcar/files/reports/report-0316.pdf"">most recent monthly update</a> on the self-driving car program.</p> \n<p>""Before we drive in a new city or new part of town, we build a detailed picture of what’s around us using the sensors on our self-driving car,"" Google writes. ""Our mapping team then turns this into useful information for our cars by categorizing interesting features on the road, such as driveways, fire hydrants, and intersections.""</p> \n<p>Google's self-driving cars are able to navigate city streets pretty well even without this kind of detailed map. But when people's lives are at stake, ""pretty well"" isn't good enough.</p> \n<p>The human-annotated map provides an extra margin of safety, allowing a car to know its location within about 4 inches. And identifying permanent, immovable road features ahead of time, the map allows a car's onboard software to quickly focus in on objects that aren't labeled in the map. These new objects tend to be people, animals, or vehicles that are likely to move, requiring the car to be extra cautious.</p> \n<h3>Google will need a huge staff to update its maps</h3> \n<p>There's a lot that software can do to speed up the process of identifying objects like street signs and fire hydrants, but Google still employs human analysts to do much of this work. When a single mistake could lead to an accident, it's better to be safe than sorry.</p> \n<p>Right now, Google only has this kind of detailed maps for a small fraction of the country's roads — primarily in the area around Silicon Valley and Austin, Texas. Taking these maps national will be expensive. Only Google knows exactly how expensive, but we can make some educated guesses by looking at how much online mapping companies are spending to maintain their maps today.</p> \n<aside><q>The human-annotated map provides an extra margin of safety, allowing a car to know its location within about 4 inches</q></aside> \n<p>A <a href=""http://www.asymco.com/2012/12/18/how-much-to-maps-cost-and-what-are-they-worth/"">rough 2012 estimate</a> found that maintaining the data for a global mapping service costs $1 billion to $2 billion per year, a figure that's in line with <a href=""https://twitter.com/tjl/status/722850832279015425"">industry rumors</a>.</p> \n<p>We should expect the maps used for self-driving cars to be even more expensive because they're going to have to be a lot more detailed. The maps that power Google's self-driving cars are going to have to mark a lot of features — fire hydrants, driveways, street signs, and bushes — that aren't relevant for merely providing turn-by-turn directions.</p> \n<p>Ironically, then, the effort to automate driving may actually create a lot of jobs, especially in the early years as self-driving technology is being rolled out. As Google and its competitors expand their self-driving vehicle programs nationwide, they're going to have to hire thousands of human analysts to produce the detailed maps that enable cars to drive safely.</p> \n<p>And this won't just be a one-off development, either. Landscapes are changing constantly, with changing speed limits, new construction, and trees growing and being cut down. So while maintaining maps may require less manpower than creating them initially, self-driving car technology is likely to employ a lot of people for the foreseeable future.</p> \n<h3>This is one reason self-driving cars are likely to be rented, not owned</h3> \n<p>If a company had to build a nationwide map before it could bring its self-driving technology to market, that could be a major obstacle. But companies don't have to do that.</p> \n<p>The alternative is to introduce the vehicles as an on-demand service rather than a product customers can buy. For example, Google might just map the city of San Francisco and then offer a self-driving car service that competes with taxis, Uber, and Lyft within the city limits. As the service grows in popularity, Google could expand its service territory, first to other parts of the San Francisco Bay Area, then to other major metropolitan areas.</p> \n<p>It might take many years before Google manages to offer services in outlying rural areas. But as Uber has demonstrated, there's a ton of demand for on-demand rides restricted to major metropolitan areas. And without the need to pay a human driver, we can expect Google's self-driving cars to be dramatically cheaper than Uber's, which will mean even greater demand for the services.</p> \n<h3>Maps may be a key strategic asset for the self-driving car industry</h3> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""6372391""><img src=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6372391/476795092.jpg""></div> \n<p>Google seems to believe that detailed maps are an essential resource for allowing cars to drive themselves safely. Of course, it's possible that some of the other companies working on self-driving car technology — Uber, Tesla, Apple, and several major car companies are all rumored to be working to develop self-driving technology of their own — will find ways to build fully self-driving cars that aren't reliant on maps. But it's also possible that maps will be an essential resource for self-driving systems for the foreseeable future.</p> \n<p>If that happens, it will provide a big strategic advantage for companies that have experience managing map data. That includes Google, of course. It also includes Apple, which has a mapping app for the iPhone. It may include BMW, Daimler and Audi, which jointly <a href=""http://www.wsj.com/articles/bmw-daimler-audi-agree-to-buy-nokias-here-maps-business-1438580698"">paid $3 billion</a> for Nokia's mapping division last year. And it may also include Uber, which has been <a href=""http://techcrunch.com/2015/06/29/uber-acquires-part-of-bings-mapping-assets-will-absorb-around-100-microsoft-employees/"">buying up mapping assets</a>.</p> \n<p>The expense of managing maps may also be a major reason why GM <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2016/1/4/10709046/gm-lyft-self-driving-cars"">teamed up</a> with Lyft earlier this year. Right now, GM's business model is to sell cars to people who expect to be able to drive them anywhere they want nationwide. But if self-driving cars need detailed maps of everywhere they go, then this business model would force GM to build a detailed nationwide map before selling its first self-driving car, an extremely daunting prospect.</p> \n<p>Instead, the Lyft partnership gives GM the opportunity to build self-driving cars that, like Lyft's service, only operate in major metropolitan areas. Collecting the mapping data required to operate in these limited areas is a much more manageable problem.</p> \n<p>Still, the importance of maps to the self-driving market is another reason that car companies may struggle to remain market leaders as the industry shifts to fully autonomous technologies. Google, Apple, and Uber have a lot of experience collecting, analyzing, and distributing vast quantities of fast-changing geographic data. Ford, GM, and Toyota don't.</p> \n<p>This also may explain why car companies have been focusing on developing partially self-driving technologies like adaptive cruise control, emergency braking, and self-parking. These relatively simple self-driving capabilities don't rely on maps, and they're compatible with car companies' existing business models. Car companies hope that these will provide customers with enough of the benefits of self-driving technology to provide a competitive alternative to fully self-driving products from Google and others. But in the long run, this approach seems unlikely to work that well, as the <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/5/28/5756736/the-case-for-self-driving-cars"">benefits of fully self-driving cars will be massive</a>.</p> \n<p><strong>Disclosure:</strong> My <strong><a href=""https://twitter.com/startupandrew"">brother</a></strong> is an <strong><a href=""https://www.firebase.com/blog/2014-10-21-firebase-joins-google.html"">executive</a></strong> at Google.</p>",Business & Finance
"Robo-advisers are the hottest trend in investing, but for most thereâ€™s a better way",http://www.vox.com/2016/5/20/11710486/robo-advisers-betterment-wealthfront,Old-fashioned target date mutual funds offer a similar service for about half the cost.,"<p>One of the hottest trends in the retail investment advising world is robo-advisers. These are online sites — two of the most popular are Wealthfront and Betterment — that allow people to manage their investment portfolios with a website.</p> \n<p>The companies' marketing pitches are simple: They perform the same task as a conventional investment adviser, but charge a fraction of the cost. Conventional investment companies have fees as high as 1 percent of a customer's invested assets. Betterment and Wealthfront cost about a third as much.</p> \n<p>It's true that if you're paying someone a 1 percent fee to manage your money, you should stop doing that. But it's not true that Betterment and Wealthfront are the best alternative. A class of mutual funds called target date funds cost about half as much as robo-advisers, while providing a very similar service.</p> \n<p>Betterment and Wealthfront offer tax-related services that may be useful to customers rich enough to exceed the $23,500 annual limit on tax-free savings. But if you're not that rich, you'll probably be better off saving money with an old-fashioned target date fund.</p> \n<h3>Most people don't actually need an investment adviser</h3> \n<p>Saving for retirement isn't complicated. You can <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/7/31/5882885/retirement-planning-saving-how-much-do-i-need"">click here</a> for the full Vox retirement guide, but fundamentally there are three things you need to do to get the most out of your retirement savings:</p> \n<ul> \n<li>Invest in low-fee index funds.</li> \n<li>As you get older, shift your investments from riskier stocks to safer bonds.</li> \n<li>Don't sell until you reach retirement age, even if markets crash.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>A financial product called a target retirement fund makes this really easy. You choose the fund that corresponds to your expected retirement date (for example, I'm in my mid-30s so I would choose Vanguard's <a href=""https://personal.vanguard.com/us/funds/snapshot?FundId=0306&amp;FundIntExt=INT"">Target Retirement 2045 fund</a>), and the fund does the rest, gradually shifting to safer assets as you get closer to your retirement date.</p> \n<p>There are low-cost target retirement funds available from <a href=""https://investor.vanguard.com/mutual-funds/target-retirement/#/mini/overview/0699"">Vanguard</a>, <a href=""https://fundresearch.fidelity.com/mutual-funds/summary/315793869"">Fidelity</a>, and <a href=""http://www.ssgafunds.com/product/fund.seam?ticker=SSDLX"">State Street</a>. Signing up only takes an hour or two, and once you've deposited your cash with one of these companies, you shouldn't have to think about it again until you reach retirement age.</p> \n<h3>Robo-advisers are only cheap compared to unnecessary human advisers</h3> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""6513491""><img src=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6513491/shutterstock_213192946.jpg""></div> \n<p>The development of these target date mutual funds is great news for consumers, but it leaves professional investment advisers — at least those that serve non-wealthy clients — with little to do. But instead of admitting that they'd been rendered obsolete and shutting down, investment advising companies have built elaborate marketing machines designed to obscure the fact that most people don't need professional advice about where to invest their retirement savings.</p> \n<p>The marketing has been pretty effective, so a lot of people pay human advisers a lot of money — an annual fee of 1 percent of invested funds isn't uncommon — for advice that they don't really need.</p> \n<p>That has created a big opening for a new generation of companies called robo-advisers.  Their pitch is that they'll provide the same basic service as a human investment adviser for about a third the cost. They're called <em>robo</em>-advisers because they provide ""advice"" using an automated website instead of having you talk to a human investment adviser.</p> \n<p>Robo-advisers mostly perform the same functions as a target retirement fund. As markets fluctuate, they automatically rebalance your portfolio to maintain an optimal mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets. And as you get closer to retirement age, robo-advising companies shift more money into the safest investment categories, reducing the risk that a stock market crash will devastate your finances right before you reach retirement age.</p> \n<p>To the extent that robo-advising companies are stealing customers away from overpriced investment advisers, that's a great development for consumers. The exact fees Wealthfront and Betterment charge depend on how much money you invest with them, but most investors will pay annual costs and fees between 0.25 percent and 0.37 percent. That compares favorably with conventional advisory services that can charge as much as 1 percent.</p> \n<p>On the other hand, Betterment and Wealthfront's fees don't compare favorably to the best target date funds. Vanguard, Fidelity, and State Street all offer target date funds with expense ratios between 0.13 and 0.16 percent — about half what typical customer will pay for service from Wealthfront or Betterment. (<span>It's important to note that not all target date funds are this cheap — most others cost significantly more, so always check a fund's expense ratio before you invest.)</span></p> \n<h3>Robo-advisers don't provide much more value than a target date fund</h3> \n<p>To their credit, Wealthfront and Betterment are pretty candid about the similarities between their products and target date funds. Wealthfront <a href=""https://pages.wealthfront.com/faq/"">addresses the issue explicitly</a> on its website, writing that ""we believe the next best option to having your portfolio managed by Wealthfront is investing in Vanguard’s target date funds.""</p> \n<p>Wealthfront points to two big reasons its products are better than a target date fund. One is tax efficiency. Wealthfront offers a service called tax loss harvesting that helps investors claim tax deductions when their investments lose value. Wealthfront claims that the tax savings from using the service can add as much as 1 percent annually to investment returns.</p> \n<aside><q>Betterment and Wealthfront's fees don't compare favorably to target date funds</q></aside> \n<p>Unfortunately, Wealthfront's methodology <a href=""https://www.kitces.com/blog/wealthfront-tax-loss-harvesting-white-paper-how-not-to-calculate-tax-alpha/?utm_source=Nerd%E2%80%99s+Eye+View+%7C+Kitces.com&amp;utm_campaign=e7697c6572-NEV_MAILCHIMP_LIST&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_4c81298299-e7697c6572-57008225#more-3021"">doesn't stand up to scrutiny</a> — the average investor isn't going to get anywhere close to 1 percent gains from this feature. Also, <a href=""https://www.kitces.com/blog/the-wash-sale-problem-when-tax-loss-harvesting-almost-substantially-identical-mutual-funds-and-etfs/"">there are some legal risks</a> to automating a complex tax-avoidance process.</p> \n<p>But more to the point, you have to be pretty rich for this feature to be useful. Tax loss harvesting only becomes useful after you max out tax-advantaged accounts like 401(k)s and IRAs. The legal limits on these accounts are $18,000 for a 401(k) and $5,500 for an IRA (note that there are also some income-related limits for both <a href=""https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/plan-participant-employee/amount-of-roth-ira-contributions-that-you-can-make-for-2016"">Roth</a> and <a href=""https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Traditional_IRA#Contribution_Eligibility_and_Limits"">traditional</a> IRAs). Unless you're in the small minority of workers saving more than $23,500 per year ($47,000 per year for a couple), tax loss harvesting is totally irrelevant.</p> \n<p>Wealthfront also argues that its service is better at fine-tuning a customer's portfolio — the same argument Betterment's CEO made when I <a href=""http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2012/03/smart-investing-is-easier-than-you-think/255007/"">talked to him in 2012</a>. Target date funds are relatively crude, using exactly the same portfolio for everyone planning to retire within a particularly five-year window. As a result, Wealthfront argues, ""the return on the target date fund might be too high or too low for a particular buyer’s risk tolerance.""</p> \n<p>Yet it's not obvious how much value this adds in practice. Most savers — even fairly sophisticated ones — don't know how to precisely quantify their ""risk tolerance."" They know they want to maximize their long-term returns without taking on too much risk, but beyond that it's mostly guesswork.</p> \n<p>And if you want more or less risk than your target date fund offers, there's a simple way to do it without paying robo-advisers' higher fees: use a target date fund for a different year than your actual retirement year. Suppose, like me, you expect to retire around 2045. If you want to take a bit more risk, you can invest in <a href=""https://personal.vanguard.com/us/funds/snapshot?FundId=0699&amp;FundIntExt=INT"">Vanguard's Target Date 2050 fund</a>, which will keep your money in high-risk, high-reward stocks for five years longer than the Vanguard's 2045 portfolio. Conversely, if you want to play it safe you can invest in the <a href=""https://personal.vanguard.com/us/funds/snapshot?FundId=0696&amp;FundIntExt=INT"">Target Date 2040 fund</a>, which will start shifting to safer assets five years earlier.</p> \n<p>At root, robo-advisers' argument against target date funds is that they're out of date. <a href=""https://www.betterment.com/resources/retirement/target-date-funds-are-out-of-date/"">Betterment emphasizes</a> that the funds were invented more than 20 years ago and haven't changed much since then. But the fact that something is old doesn't mean it's bad. And robo-advisers just don't seem to offer much value to justify their higher costs.</p> \n<p><b>Disclosure</b><b>:</b> I have most of my retirement savings in Vanguard mutual funds, and because Vanguard is structured as a cooperative, that technically makes me a Vanguard shareholder.</p> \n<p><b>Correction:</b> I originally described Betterment and Wealthfront as the two most popular robo-advisors, but Scwab's Intelligent Portfolio product is more popular than either.</p>",Business & Finance
Charles Schwab offers free investment advice â€” but there's a big catch,http://www.vox.com/2016/5/24/11721298/charles-schwab-intelligent-portfolio,Schwab's intelligent portfolio service has a conflict of interest.,"<p>Robo-advisory firms are all the rage in the investment world, as I wrote in a <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2016/5/20/11710486/robo-advisers-betterment-wealthfront"">recent article</a>. In that article, I focused on Betterment and Wealthfront, two startups that position themselves as automated online alternatives to conventional human investment advisers.</p> \n<p>I argued that for nonwealthy customers, these companies simply didn't provide enough value to be worth the significant fees they charge (though high-income families may benefit from their tax loss harvesting services). A target date mutual fund essentially provides the same service, and the best target date funds cost half as much.</p> \n<p>But that critique doesn't apply to another popular robo-adviser service offered by stock brokerage Charles Schwab, because its <a href=""https://intelligent.schwab.com/"">Intelligent Portfolio</a> service has no fees at all!</p> \n<p>Before you get too excited, you need to know that the Schwab plan has a big downside. Instead of charging customers directly, Schwab makes money off Intelligent Portfolio by steering customers into investments that don't always serve customers' interests.</p> \n<h3>Schwab forces clients to ""invest"" in cash</h3> \n<p>Conventional investment advice holds that investment portfolios should contain a mix of stocks and bonds. But Schwab requires clients to hold a significant portion of their portfolios in cash. The company's own <a href=""https://intelligent.schwab.com/public/intelligent/about-intelligent-portfolios"">example portfolios</a> allocate between 6.9 and 15 percent of customer money to a cash account.</p> \n<p>This is a bad investment strategy. Financial planners <em>do</em> encourage people to keep some money in cash for short-term emergencies. But the cash in a Schwab portfolio isn't really available for use in emergencies because Schwab requires customers to keep a minimum percentage of their portfolio in cash at all times. Taking money out of a Schwab Intelligent Portfolio account requires selling off some of your stock and bond funds — which is exactly what a cash emergency fund is supposed to help avoid.</p> \n<p>Even worse, Schwab pays a very low interest rate on customers' cash. Online banks like <a href=""https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/banking/synchrony-bank-review/"">Synchrony</a> and <a href=""https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/banking/ally-bank-review/"">Ally</a> currently pay around 1 percent interest on deposits. Ultra-safe <a href=""https://personal.vanguard.com/us/funds/snapshot?FundId=5132&amp;FundIntExt=INT"">short-term bond funds</a> can also be expected to earn around 1 percent. In contrast, Schwab's current rate (as of Monday) is a paltry 0.08 percent.</p> \n<aside><q>The cash in a Schwab portfolio isn't really available for use in emergencies</q></aside> \n<p>This mandatory cash allocation amounts to a hidden fee for using the Schwab account. If your portfolio is 15 percent cash, then the 0.92 percent gap between Schwab's 0.08 percent interest rate and the 1 percent rate you can get elsewhere amounts to a 0.138 percent hidden fee — not much different from the 0.15 percent fee Betterment charges for accounts over $100,000.</p> \n<p>And if you're saving for retirement, it's probably better to put all your money in assets with expected returns of more than 1 percent, so the practical cost of this ""cash drag"" is likely to be even higher.</p> \n<h3>The conflict of interest at the heart of Schwab's business model</h3> \n<p>Of course, Schwab argues that the conventional wisdom is wrong, and holding some of your portfolio in cash makes sense, providing ""ballast"" in times of economic turmoil. You can <a href=""https://intelligent.schwab.com/public/intelligent/blog/a-cost-benefit-analysis-of-cash.html"">read its argument</a> for a cash allocation here. I didn't find it very convincing, but you might.</p> \n<p>But the larger problem here is that there's an inherent tension between Schwab's claim to be acting as an ""adviser"" and the fact that its profits depend on steering customers to investments that make money for Schwab. You can debate whether holding 6 to 15 percent of your portfolio in cash in your portfolio is a good deal for the customer. But there's no doubt that it's a good deal for Schwab, which can invest the money in higher-yielding assets and pocket the difference.</p> \n<p>The same critique applies to Schwab's non-cash recommendations. Like other robo-advisers, Schwab puts clients' money in exchange-traded mutual funds. But there's a big difference: Betterment and Wealthfront invest purely in third-party funds, and <a href=""https://twitter.com/adamnash/status/734785232713306112"">both</a> companies <a href=""https://twitter.com/Betterment/status/734787817419747328"">say</a> they never take a commission from the funds they recommend.</p> \n<p>Schwab, by contrast, sometimes puts client money into funds operated by Schwab itself. Schwab also earns money for some of the non-Schwab funds it sells — though a Schwab spokesperson tells me that these payments are not a sales commission, but rather are for ""record-keeping, shareholder services, and other administrative services"" Schwab provides to third-party fund providers.</p> \n<p>""We work hard to be open and transparent to the client,"" said Schwab executive Tobin McDaniel when I asked him about this on Monday.</p> \n<aside><q>It's hard to be confident that Schwab is really acting in customers' best interests</q></aside> \n<p>He argues that Schwab has a rigorous process for choosing funds. He said Schwab looks for the lowest-cost option that is ""large enough and liquid enough for us to trade,"" and he points out that low-cost Vanguard funds feature prominently in Schwab portfolios.</p> \n<p>Still, when Schwab is choosing between its own funds and others supplied by third parties, it's hard to be confident that the best interests of customers is the company's only criteria.</p> \n<p>Betterment and Wealthfront don't have this problem. Their business model is clear and transparent — they make their money by directly charging clients, they recommend only third-party funds, and they don't earn payments from third-party fund providers. That means they make exactly the same amount regardless of which investments they recommend.</p> \n<p>It's still the case, as I wrote previously, that <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2016/5/20/11710486/robo-advisers-betterment-wealthfront"">a target date fund is the best option</a> for most retirement investors. But if you are interested in robo-advisers, it's worth picking a service with transparent pricing and no conflicts of interest. Schwab's ""free"" service could wind up costing you more in the long run.</p> \n<p><b>Correction:</b> I misplaced a decimal point and incorrectly quoted Schwab's interest rate as 0.8 percent instead of 0.08 percent.</p>",Business & Finance
The big puzzle in economics today: why is the economy growing so slowly?,http://www.vox.com/2016/8/1/12131216/theories-gdp-growth-slow,"The current economic recovery has been the slowest in decades, and economists donâ€™t know why.","<p id=""DSIiLS"">The growth of the US economy keeps falling short of expectations. On Friday, we learned that the US economy <a href=""http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-economy-idUSKCN1081JM"">grew at an inflation-adjusted rate of 1 percent</a> in the first half of 2016. That’s the slowest six-month growth rate since 2012, and it continues the slow growth that has characterized the recovery since 2009.</p> \n<p id=""Dm2PXK"">The weakness of the recovery has been surprising because conventional economic theory says that the bigger an economic downturn is, the bigger the subsequent boom will be. And the 2009 recession was the worst in decades, so post-2009 growth should have been massive.</p> \n<div id=""EAfWOu"" data-chorus-asset-id=""6872443""><img src=""https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6872443/GDP%20recent%20recoveries-01-1.png""></div> \n<p id=""ei8LkT"">Instead, the US economy has turned in its weakest performance in decades. Since 2009, inflation-adjusted output has barely grown at 2 percent per year. Business investment has been weak, wages have been stagnant, and worker productivity has improved at its slowest pace since World War II.</p> \n<p id=""dfxFpi"">We’re not in a recession — the economy <em>has</em> grown and unemployment has fallen to a healthy 4.9 percent. But the economy isn’t delivering the kind of rising prosperity previous generations took for granted.</p> \n<p id=""HOpMXN"">So what’s going on? It’s one of today’s most important economic questions, and there’s no consensus among economists. Here are eight of the leading theories.</p> \n<h3 id=""zotO5I"">Theory 1: We’re running out of innovations</h3> \n<div id=""JePvGB"" data-chorus-asset-id=""6872447"">\n<img src=""https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6872447/72955624.jpg""> \n<div class=""caption"">The iPhone was great but we haven’t had many other inventions like it in the 21st century.</div> \n</div> \n<p id=""K4F3iX"">The 20th century saw the development and widespread adoption of a ton of important new inventions: automobiles, airplanes, air conditioning, antibiotics, refrigerators, televisions, PCs, cell phones, and so forth. Yet with the notable exception of the smartphone, it’s hard to think of any major new technologies invented since 2000. Many aspects of our modern lives, from our kitchens to our streets, look little changed from 1996 or even 1976.</p> \n<p id=""0JP2cq"">In a <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Rise-Fall-American-Growth-Princeton/dp/0691147728"">new book</a>, economist Robert Gordon argues that this slowdown in new inventions is the root cause of the last decade’s economic malaise. He views the IT-driven boom between 1995 and 2005 as a one-time event that’s unlikely to be repeated. Now, he suggests, people are going to have to get used to slow growth of incomes, worker productivity, and the economy as a whole.</p> \n<p id=""PX8N7q"">Two data points seem to support Gordon’s point of view: <a href=""http://www.brookings.edu/research/papers/2014/11/driving-decline-firm-formation-rate-hathaway-litan"">the rate of startup formation</a> is at record lows, and so is <a href=""http://fortune.com/2015/12/02/corporate-investment-crisis/"">overall corporate investment</a>. That suggests that — perhaps — entrepreneurs and established CEOs alike are struggling to identify promising new technologies that are worth investing in.</p> \n<h3 id=""ioM0XY"">Theory 2: There’s too little spending</h3> \n<div id=""Avr8NI"" data-chorus-asset-id=""6872453"">\n<img src=""https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6872453/541938622.jpg""> \n<div class=""caption"">Has Fed chair Janet Yellen contributed to the slow growth of recent years?</div> \n</div> \n<p id=""RZfOC5"">Discussion of this theory tends to quickly get bogged down in technical jargon. But at a basic level the theory is simple: If the government gave people more money, they would spend it. And more spending would create more jobs and higher incomes.</p> \n<p id=""VAI9To"">There’s fairly broad agreement among economists that this kind of stimulus can work during a severe economic downturn. But the conventional view holds that it becomes less effective once the economy starts growing again. Indeed, Alex Tabarrok, an economist at George Mason University, argues that it’s ""crazy"" to believe that a lack of demand explains the slow recovery.</p> \n<p id=""zVLU4T"">""The time period in which monetary policy would have been effective is long over,"" he says.</p> \n<p id=""oC9Tpm"">Once an economy reaches full employment, he argues, there’s no way for increased spending to boost economic output — you’d just get more inflation instead.  And the US unemployment rate is currently 4.9 percent, near historic lows, a sign that a shortage of demand might not be a problem right now.</p> \n<p id=""NWVp1m"">But other economists aren’t so sure. Larry Summers, an economist who led President Obama's National Economic Council during Obama's first two years in office, has championed a theory of <a href=""http://larrysummers.com/2016/02/17/the-age-of-secular-stagnation/"">""secular stagnation,""</a> in which peoples’ desire to save money outstrips opportunities to invest it. This leads to a vicious cycle in which slow spending growth makes companies pessimistic about future growth, causing them to cut investment spending even further.</p> \n<p id=""3XXVNE"">So some economists believe it’s possible that more government stimulus — either interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve or more spending by Congress — could set off a more vigorous economic boom that could expand the real output of the economy.</p> \n<p id=""JYc4bm"">This could work in two ways. First, a boom could entice workers back into the workforce. The labor force participation rate for people aged 25-to-54 plunged after 2008 and is still <a href=""https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/LNS11300060"">near its lowest level</a> in 30 years. A booming labor market could reverse that trend.</p> \n<p id=""0wlGFr"">Second, more stimulus could actually make workers more productive. ""We know the same person can be engaged in higher or lower productivity activities,"" says economist Josh Mason. ""We have a lot of evidence that when you have a high-pressure economy, you have people shifting to high-productivity activities.""</p> \n<p id=""mLOsiv"">When labor markets are tight, companies are going to look harder for ways to make their employees more efficient. Companies might invest more in retraining workers for higher productivity jobs or they might invest more in labor-saving devices to economize on rising labor costs.</p> \n<p id=""2J77Gd"">Tighter labor markets can also help better match firms to workers, as Mike Konczal and Marshall Steinbaum argue in a <a href=""http://rooseveltinstitute.org/demand_side_dynamism/"">recent paper</a>. When jobs are plentiful, people are more willing to make risky job moves because they know they can always go back to their old job — or one like it — if it doesn’t work out. In contrast, in a more sluggish economy a lot of workers become locked into jobs they don’t like very much and may not be very good at because they’re worried that a job switch could lead to an even worse situation.</p> \n<h3 id=""a3iIqK"">Theory 3: Bad corporate governance is causing companies to under-invest</h3> \n<div id=""CmhJwa"" data-chorus-asset-id=""6872461"">\n<img src=""https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6872461/56061963.jpg""> \n<div class=""caption"">Investor Carl Icahn has pushed companies to pay more money out to shareholders.</div> \n</div> \n<p id=""Ry2gbn"">Another possibility: businesses have plenty of investment opportunities, but pressure from Wall Street is discouraging them from making them. This is the <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/7/24/9031597/hillary-clinton-quarterly-capitalism"">""quarterly capitalism"" critique</a> Hillary Clinton has talked about on the campaign trail.</p> \n<p id=""6LkN7H"">Over the last couple of decades, we’ve seen the rise of activist investors that take a substantial stake in a company’s stock — usually 5 to 10 percent — and then use that ownership stake as leverage to try to get companies to change how they do business. One of the most common demands is for the company to pay more cash out to shareholders in the form of dividends or stock buybacks.</p> \n<p id=""DhQFCF"">As I <a href=""http://www.vox.com/business-and-finance/2015/11/30/9780802/activist-investor-debate-explained"">argued in November</a>, there’s not much evidence for the theory that activist campaigns are hurting shareholders. Stock prices typically go up when activists target a company, and these price increases are sustained over time — suggesting that the activists create lasting value.</p> \n<p id=""RSdpz1"">But it is possible that having companies increasingly focused on the narrow interests of their shareholders is bad for the broader economy. Investments in new technologies often produce broad social benefits — think about all the non-Apple jobs created by the iPhone — that are not fully captured by a company’s shareholders. So if Wall Street is pressuring CEOs to invest less in new technologies, that could be helping shareholders but hurting the rest of us.</p> \n<h3 id=""NqxaRf"">Theory 4: The economy is weighed down with debt</h3> \n<div id=""3vtj9k"" data-chorus-asset-id=""6872485""><img src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6872485/453488546.jpg""></div> \n<p id=""BaK9zo"">A major factor behind the 2008 financial crisis was the high levels of debt accumulated by both individuals and businesses. When asset prices started to fall, people found themselves underwater, leading to defaults and panic-selling.</p> \n<p id=""dDlqfE"">The acute phase of the 2008 financial crisis was over quickly. But economist <a href=""http://www.voxeu.org/article/debt-supercycle-not-secular-stagnation"">Kenneth Rogoff has argued</a> that the effects of these high debt levels lingered for years after the crisis. Households and businesses realized that they had excessive levels of debt. The result, Rogoff argues, has been a prolonged period of depressed demand as households and businesses focus on paying down their debts instead of buying new goods and services.</p> \n<p id=""L0r9di"">This seems like a plausible explanation for the early years of the post-2008 recovery. But at this point, it’s been almost eight years since the financial crisis. That should be more than enough time for households and businesses to get their debts down to manageable levels. So the longer growth remains sluggish, the less plausible this theory becomes.</p> \n<h3 id=""j5v6FJ"">Theory 5: Excessive regulation is holding back growth</h3> \n<div id=""SasmuY"" data-chorus-asset-id=""6872497"">\n<img src=""https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6872497/584836098.jpg""> \n<div class=""caption"">Could the weak economy be this guy’s fault?</div> \n</div> \n<p id=""KaPr8h"">This is probably the most popular theory on the political right: that burdensome regulations have slowed the pace of economic growth. This theory is catnip for Republicans because it places blame squarely at the feet of President Obama, who has pushed through the Obamacare, the Dodd-Frank financial regulation bill, stricter environmental regulations, and more.</p> \n<p id=""QjKiVf"">Others point to burdensome regulations beyond Obama’s agenda. The White House itself has pointed to the <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2016/6/20/11963748/obama-occupational-licensing"">proliferation of occupational licensing laws</a> — for everything for barbers to florists — as an impediment to economic growth. A <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2016/6/20/11963748/obama-occupational-licensing"">recent paper</a> by economist James Bessen finds evidence that regulations have created barriers to entry that boost the profits of incumbents in certain industries while reducing the dynamism of the economy as a whole.</p> \n<p id=""FVWK6B"">Yet it has proven hard to find evidence that this is a major reason for the slow recovery. ""I thought that regulation was probably one of the major causes of declining dynamism,"" says Tabarrok, who co-authored a <a href=""http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2559803"">study</a> on this topic in 2014. But he and his co-author were unable to find evidence to back up the theory. ""The basic reason is pretty simple,"" he says. ""You see declining dynamism in pretty much all industries.""</p> \n<p id=""kSV1At"">The theory that regulation is the major factor choking off innovation is hard to square with the historical record. The US economy enjoyed its fastest growth in worker productivity in the half century between 1930 and 1970. This happens to be the period when many sectors of the economy were subject to burdensome New Deal-era regulations.</p> \n<p id=""DGILfW"">Policymakers relaxed these regulations over the course of the 1970s and early 1980s, deregulating industries like trucking, airlines, telecommunications, energy, and more. And yet, the growth of productivity and wages was slower between 1975 and 1995 than they had been in previous decades.</p> \n<p id=""kjCdST"">Tabarrok is quick to point out that this doesn’t mean regulation is harmless — it’s possible that many individual industries would be more productive with less regulation. But growing regulation does not seem to be the primary reason for the productivity slowdown of recent decades.</p> \n<h3 id=""PmOseO"">Theory 6: There’s too much housing regulation in big cities</h3> \n<p id=""n7ezFS"">Housing regulations are, of course, a subset of regulations generally. But there’s reason to think they could be significant.</p> \n<p id=""eOS2gH"">Big cities and their surrounding suburbs have <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/10/22/9595682/google-employee-truck"">strict regulations</a> that effectively limit how much housing can be built in the most economically dynamic metropolitan areas. The result has been <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2016/4/23/11490758/oakland-housing-crisis"">skyrocketing housing prices</a> and — more importantly — <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/timothylee/2012/05/10/why-the-bay-area-should-have-11-million-residents-today/#39ab2e782807"">slow population growth</a> in metropolitan areas like San Francisco, New York, and Boston. And that’s a problem because these cities account for a <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2016/5/29/11805060/big-small-county-growth"">disproportionate share of innovation and job growth</a> in today’s economy:</p> \n<div id=""EE5Ga3"" data-chorus-asset-id=""6857937""><img src=""https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6857937/eig_chart.png""></div> \n<p id=""NT9azc"">The chart shows the growth of establishments — that is, business locations like restaurants, car repair shops, or factories — during the first five years of the past three recoveries. In the past, smaller counties tended to grow faster than larger counties. This made a certain amount of sense — large counties like Los Angeles or Dallas were already expensive and crowded places to live, so it was easier for economic growth to happen in smaller towns or outlying suburbs.</p> \n<p id=""jYz0x6"">But in the latest recovery, the pattern has reversed, with large counties like Los Angeles County, Miami-Dade County, and Kings County (Brooklyn) enjoying a disproportionate share of business expansion. The same pattern holds for job growth.</p> \n<p id=""SvC3ht"">Obviously, this is bad news for people who live in small towns. But it may also help to explain the slow growth of the economy as a whole. Because it’s possible that big cities would be creating new jobs at a much faster rate if there were more workers available. But big cities’ housing restrictions mean that there’s nowhere for additional workers to live.</p> \n<h3 id=""pbt7ee"">Theory 7: The economy is becoming dominated by big, incumbent companies</h3> \n<p id=""L0cmSA"">The period since 2010 has been bad for ordinary workers, but they’ve been great for corporate America. In the last six years, corporate profits have been at their <a href=""https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/W273RE1A156NBEA"">highest level</a> — as a share of the economy — since the 1960s.</p> \n<p id=""6vyDpP"">Some commentators have argued that this reflects lax enforcement of antitrust laws, which has <a href=""http://www.economist.com/blogs/graphicdetail/2016/03/daily-chart-13"">allowed many industries</a> to become increasingly concentrated. With larger market shares, these big firms have more power to raise prices, and they’ve also become more effective at locking new firms out of the market.</p> \n<p id=""u5VBm8"">There’s little doubt that there has been a trend toward industry concentration in many important industries, and it seems plausible that this is a factor in the growing profitability of corporate America. What’s not so clear, however, is whether this is leading to slower innovation.</p> \n<p id=""JlbJB0"">Two well-known advocates for the view that industry concentration is holding back economic progress are <a href=""http://washingtonmonthly.com/magazine/novdec-2015/bloom-and-bust/"">Phillip Longman</a> and <a href=""https://www.minneapolisfed.org/publications/the-region/the-costs-of-monopoly-a-new-view"">James Schmitz</a>. But I found their arguments hard to evaluate because they seemed highly backward-looking.</p> \n<p id=""TugaYA"">Longman, for example, argues that deregulation of the railroad, trucking, and airline industries allowed industry consolidation that has, in turn, hurt smaller cities and towns. That might be true, but it’s hard to believe that it’s a major factor driving recent economic trends. After all, the fastest-growing industries of recent decades — like software and finance — are not very dependent on railroads or trucking   to get their goods to market.</p> \n<p id=""FJjCA8"">For his part, Schmitz writes about the sugar industry between the 1940s and and the 1970s, the cement industry in the 1970s and 1980s, and the construction industry in the 1920s. His stories do a good job of illustrating his theoretical argument, but they don’t shed much light on whether growing industry concentration is a serious problem today.</p> \n<h3 id=""HQjgtU"">Theory 8: A slow-growing, aging population is hurting growth</h3> \n<div id=""T5uZWg"" data-chorus-asset-id=""6872553""><img src=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6872553/81497647.jpg""></div> \n<p id=""x6r4Mw"">A final theory suggested to me by Tabarrok is demographics. Americans are having fewer babies than they did in the past, and this has had two related effects: The population as a whole is growing more slowly, and the average age of the population is rising.</p> \n<p id=""LMLH5X"">There’s reason to think that both trends are bad for economic growth. Younger people are more likely to pursue new ideas, take risks, and start new businesses. So an aging population is likely to lead to a less dynamic economy.</p> \n<p id=""IRLTAC"">Slower population growth can also be a source of economic stagnation in its own right. A rapidly growing population means rising demand for products of all kinds — new homes, restaurants, shopping malls, and so forth. So more businesses will be started in general, which means more opportunities for experimentation. Successful stores, restaurants, and other businesses can be expanded or franchised to other metropolitan areas, allowing good ideas to spread quickly.</p> \n<p id=""HRwqrb"">In contrast, in a country with a more stagnant population, starting a new business requires replacing an existing business. Even if a young person has an innovative idea for a new company, the practical difficulties of getting the business started might be too great for putting the idea into practice. And so change can only happen by convincing existing business owners to change their behavior — an inherently slower and more difficult process.</p> \n<p><b>Correction:</b> This article originally misstated Larry Summers' role in the Obama administration.</p>",Business & Finance

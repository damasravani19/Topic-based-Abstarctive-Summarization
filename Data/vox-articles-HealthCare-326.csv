Obamacare succeeded for one simple reason: it's horrible to be uninsured,http://www.vox.com/2014/4/1/5570780/the-two-reasons-obamacare-hit-7-million-enrollees,"After a catastrophic launch, Obamacare still signed up 8 million people. That's because being uninsured is worse than using HealthCare.Gov.","<p>There's a very simple reason that Obamacare hit 8 million sign-ups: Being uninsured is horrible.</p> \n<p>But the political conversation over Obamacare was driven almost entirely by people who had, and knew they would be able to keep, their health insurance. It was filled with a lot of assumptions, theories, and speculations about what people who didn't have good insurance, or any insurance, would do. And after Obamacare's disastrous launch, the theory took hold that these people wouldn't find this untested program worth the trouble. It was the permanently insured speculating about the uninsured and the barely insured – and, unsurprisingly, they got it wrong.</p> \n<p><q>It was hard to sign up for Obamacare. It's worse to be uninsured.</q></p> \n<p>Back in December, when the web site's woes were fresh in everyone's mind, I made a <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/12/30/obamacare-just-might-net-its-7-million-sign-ups/"">prediction</a> that sounded strange even to me: Obamacare might still hit its 7 million enrollees. The reason I made that prediction was I'd been talking to the uninsured who'd been spending hours or days or weeks trying to get through the web site. They were frustrated and they were angry. But <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/12/05/its-hard-to-sign-up-for-obamacare-its-much-worse-to-be-uninsured/"">not one of them</a> had given up.</p> \n<p>I asked pollsters Mike Perry and Tresa Undem, who specialized in surveying the uninsured, whether they had found anyone who'd been deterred by the unusable web site and overloaded call centers. Not even one person, they said. The persistence was amazing.</p> \n<p>It was hard to sign up for Obamacare. But what too many insured pundits forgot is it's much worse to be uninsured, or underinsured. And that's true, too, for the people who saw their plans canceled by Obamacare and then needed to decide whether to sign up for a new one.</p> \n<p>""If you live in my world, you have done or read study after study how much the uninsured want health insurance and why they want it,"" Kaiser Family Foundation president Drew Altman says. ""So you just had to believe they would give it a serious try.""</p> \n<p><img src=""http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/assets/4316117/enrollment.png"" class=""photo"" alt=""Enrollment""></p> \n<p><br>People did give it a serious try. And when the site failed them, they waited a few months and gave it another serious try. In March and April, 3.7 million people signed up for coverage, three times as many as the White House had expected.</p> \n<h3><span>Obamacare's March madness</span></h3> \n<p>Over 217,000 people signed up for Obamacare on the very last day March, more than double all sign-ups in the <i>entire </i>month of October.</p> \n<p><span>Specific states saw similar figures, some more dramatic: In the District of Columbia, for example, one-quarter of all people who signed up did so in the last week of March.</span></p> \n<p>The sign-up surge appears to have continued into April, after the Obama administration gave shoppers who started the enrollment process by the end of March two additional weeks to finish. <span>California announced Thursday that 205,000 people signed up for coverage between April 1 and 15. That accounts for 15 percent of the 1.3 million people who signed up for coverage there. </span></p> \n<p><q>15 percent of california's 1.3 million sign-ups happened in april.</q></p> \n<p>""For a lot of people health insurance is far from their favorite thing in life,"" Kaiser Family Foundation president Drew Altman says. ""I think the huge volume at the very end is just as much about how Americans do stuff and procrastinate, as it is about the health care law.""</p> \n<p><span>This doesn't come as a total surprise; about a quarter of Americans file their taxes to the Internal Revenue Service in the two weeks before the deadline. Massachusetts saw a spike(although not as big) in enrollment during its law's first enrollment period, in 2007.</span></p> \n<p><img src=""http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/assets/4223015/connector_enrollment.png"" alt=""Connector_enrollment""><span>But even knowing that deadlines tend to motivate action, nobody expected how much action would happen in March.</span></p> \n<p>It made more sense though if you spent much time talking to people about health insurance. They don't like trying to sign up for it. It's complex and it's intimidating and it's expensive. But buying insurance isn't nearly as bad as being uninsured.</p> \n<h4>Obamacare shoppers really, really wanted health insurance</h4> \n<p>There were many obstacles standing in between health law shoppers and buying insurance coverage. This was partially technical failures that could have been avoided. But there was also the fact that most people don't understand health insurance, or have much experience shopping for it. People have trouble defining key insurance terms, things like co-insurance and deductible.</p> \n<p>""We made enrollment so much harder than it needed to be,"" says Mike Perry, a founder of polling firm PerryUndem, which has conducted numerous focus group with uninsured Americans. ""There was a knowledge gap, there were glitches, most people didn't know about financial assistance or navigators. We had so many hurdles and yet they persevered.""</p> \n<p>They persevered because it's horrible to be uninsured. When Perry and his co-founder Tresa Undem conducted focus groups, they didn't hear a lot of ""I give up"" when the uninsured ran into obstacles. Instead, it was a lot more of ""I'll try again later.""</p> \n<p><span>The health-care law beat its mark because it was selling something 8 million people want to buy.</span></p> \n<p dir=""ltr""><span>On a policy level, beating the 7 million number isn't especially meaningful for the Affordable Care Act. It's a political yardstick that doesn't measure how many healthy people, for example, are signing up, a crucial factor for determining whether premiums go up next year. There's nothing magical about beating 7 million enrollees.</span></p> \n<p dir=""ltr"">But even if the total number of Obamacare sign-ups isn't especially important, the groundswell of enrollments is: it shows that the fundamental premise of the law -- that people want health insurance -- is correct. They're willing to battle through a crummy website and a complicated law and endless political controversy in that process, too, if it means coming out with a health insurance policy at the end.</p> \n<p dir=""ltr"">""That's not a new idea that people want health insurance,"" Perry says. ""But that they would stick through so much hassle still amazes us.""</p>"

His eyes used to glaze over when his father, a doctor, would start talking HMOs and PPOs.</p> \n<p><img alt=""Charles_gaba01"" class=""photo"" src=""http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/assets/4237687/charles_gaba01.jpg"" width=""300"" align=""center""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Charles Gaba</p> \n<p><span>But for some reason, he became interested in the Obamacare enrollment numbers and has spent six months tracking them obsessively. He usually does so at night, after his 8-year-old son has gone to sleep. And with no background in health policy whatsoever, Gaba built the country's most trusted source of Affordable Care Act enrollment data.</span></p> \n<p>Gaba's enrollment counts are routinely more up-to-date than the federal government's, which is why they turn up on newspaper front pages and cable news shows. Paul Krugman has described him as ""<a href=""http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/03/30/the-aca-surge-blackout/"">the invaluable Charles Gaba</a>.""</p> \n<p><span>Gaba became well-known because he did something that, on the surface, seemed easy: He counted the Obamacare sign-ups. </span><span>Lots of other people (myself included) tried to do this, and failed.</span><span> Figuring out how many people have enrolled in Obamacare turns out to be a surprisingly difficult task.</span></p> \n<p>""At a certain point, and I'm not sure when, I just kind of became the guy doing this,"" Gaba said in a recent interview. ""I started to feel obligated to keep going.""</p> \n<h3>'Sixteen different, moving sources of information.'</h3> \n<p><img src=""http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/assets/4195221/state_health_insurance_exchange_decisions.png"" class=""photo"" alt=""State_health_insurance_exchange_decisions""><br id=""1396567685947""> It was hard to anticipate how challenging it would be to keep track of Obamacare's sign-ups. Massachusetts' coverage expansion 2007 is usually the closest analog for predicting the health care law &mdash; but there you had one state tracking enrollment, not dozens.</p> \n<p>Prior to open enrollment's start, Health and Human Services had never committed to a particular plan for releasing information. They eventually settled on monthly data releases, which left lots of space between each data dump.</p> \n<p>But that was just for the 36 states where the federal government was running Healthcare.gov. There were another 15 marketplaces run by states and the District of Columbia who, as early as October, started releasing sporadic data.</p> \n<p><q class=""right"">Most people who tried to track enrollment &mdash; and weren't doing it for a living &mdash; gave up</q></p> \n<p><span>""The challenge, on the exchange side, is you've got 14 states, the District of Columbia, and the feds all reporting different information at different times,"" says Caroline Pearson of Avalere Health, a research firm. ""You've got 16 different moving sources of information. It's on different websites, states are tweeting it. It gets released in different formats that are all over the place.""</span></p> \n<p>Even the information that states spewed out was different. Some states, like Washington, included a breakdown of which shoppers had paid their first month's premium and who hadn't.  Most states, and the federal government, didn't provide that granular data, instead releasing a lump sum of customers who had and hadn't paid for the plans they selected.</p> \n<p>""We generally try to use the data from the carriers and states to come up with a reasonable assumption of who has paid and who hasn't,"" Pearson says.</p> \n<p>Most people who tried to track enrollment &mdash; and weren't doing it for a living &mdash; gave up. It was too time-consuming; just when you thought you'd collected the most current data, another state would publish something even newer.</p> \n<p>""You have 16 state exchanges that don't always keep to a schedule,"" says Aaron Strauss, who tried tracking enrollment in early October. He estimated he would spend about two hours a day &mdash; one before work, one after &mdash; trying to check in on more than a dozen state-run marketplaces.</p> \n<p>At Avalere, Pearson has a team of 26 people working for her who try to keep tabs on state enrollment data and sort out issues like this. Gaba, on the other hand, is a team of one.</p> \n<h3>'<span>For January, I ended up being off by about 500 people.'</span>\n</h3> \n<p>There are arguably three things that set Gaba's site apart from others. The first is the speed: In a given day, Gaba will post enrollment reports from&nbsp;<a href=""http://acasignups.net/14/03/29/south-carolina-qhps-76k"">South Carolina</a><span>, </span><a href=""http://acasignups.net/14/03/29/new-york-shop-qhps-double-5k-10k"">New York</a><span>, </span><a href=""http://acasignups.net/14/03/29/maryland-abandoning-their-exchange-replacing-it-connecticuts"">Maryland</a><span>, </span><a href=""http://acasignups.net/14/03/29/nevada-qhps-1k-322-xerox-thinks-theyll-complete-57k-during-extension"">Nevada</a><span>, </span><span>and </span><a href=""http://acasignups.net/14/03/29/california-suggestions-even-larger-numbers"">California</a><span>. He'll work those into his spreadsheet and come up with new projections of, nationally, how many people have enrolled that day. He says he relies on a robust network of tipsters, who have sent in stories and state-level updates on a regular basis. </span></p> \n<p>""The spreadsheet tells me what the average has been and I can extrapolate out nationally,"" he says. ""So if I have data for 10 states for the first 10 days of March, I have a good idea of national sign ups.""</p> \n<p><span>The second is transparency: Every data point comes with a link, with every decision about how to count sign-ups &mdash; or retraction of data later found to have errors &mdash; announced prominently.</span></p> \n<p><q class=""left"">""I just kind of became the guy doing this. I started to feel obligated to keep going"" </q></p> \n<p>The last distinction is a sort of simplicity to his work. Gaba only tracks the number of people who pick an insurance plan on the exchange. He does, for example not attempt to estimate the percent of people who have paid for their insurance plans, a space where data is still sparse. This has drawn some criticism from Obamacare opponents, who argue paid accounts is a better way to measure who is actually gaining coverage through Healthcare.gov.</p> \n<p>""It's a legitimate question and there's nothing wrong with asking,"" Gaba says. ""But it's not the thing that I'm tracking.""</p> \n<div>Gaba's obsessive data collection has led to remarkably accurate data projection. <span>The Obama administration won't release estimates of daily sign-up totals; Gaba will, and does quite well. </span>\n</div> \n<div><br></div> \n<p><span>In January, Gaba </span><a href=""http://acasignups.net/14/03/11/february-hhs-enrollment-report-released-943k-qhps-4242m-total"" style=""background-color: #ffffff; line-height: 1.5;"">projected </a><span>that Obamacare would hit 3.3 million sign ups. The actual number, released by the Obama administration five days later, was 3.299 million. His February projection was 4.2 percent off from the final-sign tally.</span></p> \n<p>""For January I ended up being off by about 500 people,"" Gaba says. ""It was ridiculous.""</p> \n<p>This is how Gaba was able to predict on his blog that the White House had hit 6 million sign-ups in the last week of March before the White House had even announced the news. One administration official suggested on Twitter, after that he should ""take a victory lap.""</p> \n<h3><span>'I'm getting a little nervous.'</span></h3> \n<p>Gaba doesn't fully understand how he became so entangled in the enrollment numbers &mdash; except that it's become enough of a time commitment to negatively affect his actual web development business.</p> \n<p><span>""My website clients are like 'that's great you're mentioned in the New York Times but where's my website,'"" he says. ""I'm a little behind on some of my work. </span><span>I've had to give a few good-faith discounts as an apology.""</span></p> \n<p>We spoke the last weekend of March, just before open enrollment was slated to end. Gaba had cleared his schedule for March 31 and April 1, expecting a deluge of media requests and tracking data. At that point, he was forecasting 6.7 million sign-ups by the end of March (a number he revised upwards to 6.9-7.0 million mid-day March 31 , as reports of a sign-up surge grew).</p> \n<p>""I'm getting a little nervous,"" Gaba told me. ""There are so many variables. I know there's going to be a surge but don't know how much of a surge.""</p> \n<p>Gaba was initially planning to quit blogging enrollment numbers at the end of March &mdash; until the Obama administration announced it would allow some sign-ups to continue into April. So now he's committed to running his website through the end of this open enrollment period. He's not sure about next year.</p> \n<p><span>""It seems to be filling a need right now, so I'll stick with it,"" he says. ""By the end of the month, hopefully everyone will move on. I think, hopefully, the site will have served its function.""</span></p>"

Block grants for Medicaid. It's was in Rep. Paul Ryan's budget. It was in Mitt Romney's presidential platform. And it's at the core of Senate Republicans' new budget proposal, <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.wsj.com/articles/senate-republicans-budget-targets-medicaid-food-stamps-1426201369?wpmm=1&amp;wpisrc=nl_wonk"">the Wall Street Journal reported Monday</a>.</p> \n<p>In its simplest form, turning Medicaid into a ""block grant"" simply means handing control of the program — and the funding for it — over to the states. But in all these plans the details reveal something else, too: a massive cut to Medicaid spending that could throw tens of millions of people off the program. To understand how that works, you need to understand the unusual way that Medicaid works.</p> \n<h3>Right now, states split the cost of Medicaid with the federal government</h3> \n<div id=""Medicaid_spending_(in_billions)""></div> \n<p> \n<script type=""text/javascript""><!-- \nwindow.pym || document.write( '<scr' + 'ipt src=""http://apps.voxmedia.com/tools/javascripts/vendor/pym-15baa7e3.js""></scr' + 'ipt>' ); \n// --></script> \n<script type=""text/javascript""><!-- \nvar Medicaid_spending_(in_billions) = new pym.Parent( ""Medicaid_spending_(in_billions)"", ""http://apps.voxmedia.com/tools/charts-public/?labels=2000%2C2001%2C2002%2C2003%2C2004%2C2005%2C2006%2C2007%2C2008%2C2009%2C2010%2C2011%2C2012%2C2013&datasets=117%2C129.8%2C146.6%2C161%2C175%2C180.4%2C179.3%2C189%2C200.2%2C246.3%2C269.8%2C270.7%2C248.3%2C260%7C89%2C99.8%2C111.6%2C115.1%2C121.3%2C135.5%2C135.8%2C143.2%2C151.7%2C132.3%2C131.7%2C156.7%2C183.7%2C190.6&title=Medicaid%20spending%20(in%20billions)&description=null&source=National%20Health%20Expenditures&link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cms.gov%2FResearch-Statistics-Data-and-Systems%2FStatistics-Trends-and-Reports%2FNationalHealthExpendData%2Findex.html%3Fredirect%3D%2Fnationalhealthexpenddata%2F&type=line&legend=Federal%20spending%2CState%20spending"", { xdomain: "".*.voxmedia.com"" } ); \n// --></script> \n</p> \n<p>Medicaid, the federal entitlement program that covers low-income Americans, is perennially the largest item in state budgets. Medicaid spending is shared between the federal government and states, with each paying a set percent of each beneficiary's costs. In return for the federal match, states must meet certain requirements for coverage set by the federal government.</p> \n<p>The federal/state split varies from state to state, with the feds footing a higher percent of the bill in states where people earn less. That's why in Mississippi, for example, the federal government pays for 74 percent of each beneficiary’s costs but only 50 percent in Massachusetts.</p> \n<p>Medicaid pays this amount regardless of how many people are on the program. In that way, Medicaid is an open-ended funding commitment to cover a set percent of enrollees’ bills. When the need for Medicaid rises — like during a recession, or a particularly bad flu season — the federal government is committed to meeting it.</p> \n<h3>A block grant would limit the federal government's commitment</h3> \n<p>Instead of paying a set percentage of each enrollee's bill, they would pay a specific amount to each state. It would then be up to the states to figure out how to best spend those funds.</p> \n<p>""It sets an agreement that this is the amount of money you're going to spend and there should be no surprises,"" says Tony Keck, who directs South Carolina's Medicaid program and supports block grants.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""center"">A block grant would limit the feds' commitment to Medicaid </q></p> \n<p>Block grants are typically meant to save the federal government money. The one in the House Republicans’ 2012 budget, for example, was estimated to cut <a href=""http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/cpquery/?&amp;sid=cp112a7blf&amp;r_n=hr421.112&amp;dbname=cp112&amp;&amp;sel=TOC_145070&amp;""></a><a href=""http://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/attachments/03-20-Ryan_Specified_Paths_2.pdf"">$800 billion</a> in Medicaid spending over a decade (about a third of the overall budget). In return for accepting less money, block-granted states would get additional flexibility to decide how, exactly, Medicaid dollars get spent.</p> \n<p>""Everybody's proposal is slightly different, but at the end of the day, it's a fixed sum of money,"" says Deborah Bachrach, who previously ran New York's Medicaid program and is currently a partner at the law firm Manatt, Phelps and Phillips.</p> \n<h3>Block grants don't have to cut Medicaid spending — but they usually do</h3> \n<p>But it's certainly possible to give state governments more flexibility to implement changes to Medicaid without also slashing federal spending on the program. If it wanted to, the federal government could double Medicaid funding and call it a block grant — but that's not what typical proposals do.</p> \n<p>Most recent block grant proposals — including those from Jindal and Budget Chair Paul Ryan (R-WI) — would cap Medicaid spending, only allowing spending to grow due to inflation and population growth. That usually amounts to about 3 percent growth on average, the Bipartisan Policy Center <a href=""http://bipartisanpolicy.org/blog/2013/03/ryan-fy14-budget"">notes</a>. By contrast, Medicaid has typically grown at 7 percent annually.</p> \n<h3>Recent block grant proposals would cut hundreds in billions in Medicaid spending</h3> \n<p><a style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.65;"" href=""http://www.wsj.com/articles/senate-republicans-budget-targets-medicaid-food-stamps-1426201369?wpmm=1&amp;wpisrc=nl_wonk"" target=""_blank"">The Wall Street Journal has reported</a> that the Senate Republicans' new proposal would reduce Medicaid spending by $732 billion over the next decade.</p> \n<p>Separately, the Bipartisan Policy Center had analyzed Congressional Budget Office numbers on the Ryan's block grant proposal in 2013, and estimated it would cut Medicaid spending by <a href=""http://bipartisanpolicy.org/blog/2013/03/21/paul-ryan%E2%80%99s-fiscal-year-2014-budget-details"">$160 billion </a>in 2022. That's about a third of the expected budget that year, without block grants.</p> \n<p>The Jindal proposal, which set a similar spending target, would likely have similarly sized cuts. This isn't true of any block grant proposal, but instead is specific to the way that the Jindal and Ryan plans are structured.</p> \n<h3>How could states handle those cuts?</h3> \n<p>That's the $732 billion question. <span>The Kaiser Family Foundation </span><a href=""http://kaiserfamilyfoundation.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/8185-02.pdf"">assessed</a><span> the block grant proposal in Ryan's 2012 budget and estimated that it would mean between 14 and 20 million fewer people receiving Medicaid by 2022. There's no similarly granular version of the Senate Republicans' plan yet to allow outside experts to do this type of analysis. </span></p> \n<p>Block grant supporters argue that with the lower funding — alongside more flexibility — states could run more efficient Medicaid programs.</p> \n<p>""I've got state plan amendments to make simple changes, in theory, that the federal government should want to happen,"" Keck says. ""I want to bring dietitians into the program, but that's been held up for a year.""</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""left"">""We could be delivering better services if we weren't stuck waiting.""</q></p> \n<p>Keck says he would gladly accept quality metrics — a requirement to, for example, reduce infant mortality — as part of a block grant agreement. That would curtail states trying to hit the spending metric by simply not providing care.</p> \n<p>Block grant opponents don't think the savings are possible without harming benefits, either by dropping people off the program or cutting into the benefits they receive. A block grant system would be very different from the current Medicaid program where all people in certain categories — low-income, pregnant women, for example — are guaranteed access to the program. There are mandatory groups of people states have to cover.</p> \n<p>""The administrative costs of Medicaid are the lowest of any insurer in the country,"" says Bachrach. ""You can't do the cuts through administration. And if more primary care and community-based services could save 30 percent, we would have done that already.""</p> \n<p>The details of who states could and couldn't cut — and how much they could alter the benefit package — aren't spelled out in a lot of block grant proposals, which makes it difficult to predict how, exactly, states would react to the new funding system.</p> \n<p>""If you're going to cut spending that much, you're going to need to give governors tools to do it,"" says Joan Alker, executive director at the Georgetown Center for Children and Families. ""It might be waiting lists or enrollment caps. People can't have a guarantee of coverage unless there's an assurance of open-ended federal funding.""</p> \n<p>The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, for its part, is skeptical that states could increase efficiency enough to offset the spending cuts.</p> \n<p>""If states were given additional flexibility…they might be able to improve the efficiency of those programs in delivering health care to low-income populations,"" the agency wrote in its<a href=""http://cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/attachments/03-20-Ryan_Specified_Paths_2.pdf""> 2012 analysis</a> of the Ryan budget. ""Nevertheless, even with significant efficiency gains, the magnitude of the reduction in spending relative to such spending in the other scenarios means that states would need to…make considerable cutbacks.""</p> \n<h3>Medicaid costs are actually growing pretty slowly right now</h3> \n<p>Medicaid's costs as a program are growing, but when measured per person have been nearly stagnant for over a decade.</p> \n<p>The cost of the total Medicaid program grew by 3.3 percent in 2012, which was about a half-percent faster than the rest of the economy (and hovered around the growth rates of Medicare and private insurance).</p> \n<p>When measured on a per-person basis, Medicaid's costs have held stable for over a decade. That means that holding enrollment constant, Medicaid's spending is growing much more slowly than private insurance and Medicare:</p> \n<p><img alt=""Per_capita_health_spending_by_payer"" class=""photo"" src=""http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/assets/4237895/per_capita_health_spending_by_payer.jpg""></p> \n<h3>Medicaid is flexible in some ways — and inflexible in others</h3> \n<p><q class=""right"" aria-hidden=""true"">""There were days I would have given anything for more flexibility and less regulatory oversight.""</q></p> \n<p><span> </span><span>There are definitely things that states can't change about Medicaid: they can't cap enrollment for certain populations, like low-income children women who are pregnant or the blind and disabled who fall under certain earning thresholds.</span></p> \n<p>At the same time, there does seem to be a lot of space for experimentation. Indiana, for example, runs<a href=""http://member.indianamedicaid.com/programs--benefits/medicaid-programs/healthy-indiana-plan.aspx""> a Medicaid program </a>that requires enrollees to pay a monthly premium, like in private insurance. Oregon is<a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/01/18/can-oregon-save-american-health-care/""> using budget caps</a> to try and drive down its health care spending. And in Arkansas, the state <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/02/28/arkansass-different-plan-to-expand-medicaid/"">is using Medicaid dollars to buy beneficiaries private health insurance plans</a>.</p> \n<p>All of those types of changes, however, require a sign-off from the federal government — which Medicaid directors note can be a frustrating process that takes years.</p> \n<p>""There were days I would have given anything for more flexibility and less regulatory oversight,"" says Bachrach.

How many people have insurance because of Obamacare?,http://www.vox.com/health-care/2014/4/10/5579430/vox-guide-obamacare-enrollment-numbers,There have been a lot of Obamacare enrollment numbers flying around in the past week.

Over the past 60 years, there's been a nationwide movement for deinstitutionalization: moving mental health patients out of long-stay psychiatric facilities and into more community-based treatment centers.</p> \n<p>The main goal of deinstitutionalization, which began in the late 1950s, was to get patients out of large, public institutions where they were largely hidden from public view.

And for car liability insurers, the results point to good news.</span></p> \n<h3>Car insurers will pay less for health-care costs</h3> \n<p><img alt=""161219550"" class=""photo"" src=""http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/assets/4263115/161219550.jpg""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Accidents should be less expensive for car insurers under Obamacare. Joe Amon / Denver Post</p> \n<p>Liability insurers, including those who cover cars and worker's compensation, right now spend tens of billions each year on medical costs. RAND expects Obamacare to shift those costs to health insurance companies.</p> \n<p>Car insurers, for example, spent $35 billion covering health costs associated with accidents in 2007, according to RAND. That was 2 percent of all US health-care costs that year.</p> \n<p>But as more people pick up health insurance under Obamacare, RAND expects those costs to instead be covered by health insurers. Instead of charging a car insurer for medical costs after an accident, customers will call on their new health insurers to pay up.</p> \n<p>The effect, RAND estimates, could be as high as a 5 percent premium reduction in some states.</p> \n<p>And those are just the potential short-term savings. If Obamacare succeeds in <a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/health-care-spending/does-obamacare-effect-health-care-spending"">driving down health-care costs</a>, the savings in medical care will benefit liability insurers as well. So if a car insurance company finds itself still paying for medical costs brought on by an accident, it will save money if those medical costs are significantly reduced due to the health-care law.</p> \n<p>All of this could be good news for customers: RAND expects liability insurers to pass on the savings through lower premiums and expanded coverage options. But it's possible these companies will pocket the savings in profits.</p> \n<h3>But doctors will need to pay more for medical malpractice insurance</h3> \n<p><img alt=""129376831"" class=""photo"" src=""http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/assets/4263043/129376831.jpg""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Doctors probably won't like all the effects of the health-care law. Universal Images Group</p> \n<p>More people with health insurance means more people going to the doctor, according to RAND. For doctors, that means more medical malpractice claims — and therefore higher costs on medical malpractice insurance.</p> \n<p>RAND researchers estimate the increase in payments to be around 3.4 percent, but the state-by-state estimates range from 0.4 percent to 7.8 percent.</p> \n<p>Again, researchers caution that there's a lot of uncertainty surrounding these estimates. But the general effect should be an increase in medical malpractice costs for doctors, on top of savings for other liability insurers — and maybe their customers, too.</p>"

That's important because the White House reported a surge in signups on the exchanges as the March 31 enrollment deadline approached.

But experts caution it's too early to pull a long-term trend from the data.</p> \n<p>The concern is that, if the trend does hold up, the data could indicate that Obamacare enrollees tend to be sicker and, therefore, more expensive for insurance companies and the federal government.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""center"">It's too early to pull a long-term trend from the data</q></p> \n<p>Specifically, Express Scripts found 1.1 percent of total prescriptions on exchange plans during January and February went to specialty medications, which treat major health issues like HIV, depression, pain, and seizures. In comparison, specialty medications made up only 0.75 percent of prescriptions in commercial health plans. Both those numbers seem small, but they equate to a 47 percent difference that could make Obamacare enrollees much more expensive to cover.</p> \n<p>Larry Levitt, senior vice president at Kaiser Family Foundation, warns the numbers are very much preliminary.</p> \n<p>""Everyone expected that the earliest enrollees were more likely to be sicker,"" he says. ""These are people who already had coverage or absolutely knew they needed coverage and were previously locked out of the market because of a preexisting condition. It also included people in particular coming from high-risk pools.""</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""right"">""If you're HIV-positive, you're probably not going to wait until the last day to sign up""</q>Levitt argues it's very unlikely someone who's HIV-positive, for example, is going to decline affordable health insurance when given the opportunity. Meanwhile, healthier people might not feel the need to sign up for Obamacare until some other factor — say, the <a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/obamacare/what-is-the-individual-mandate"">individual mandate</a> — pressures them to get health insurance.</p> \n<p>So the sicker people, Levitt says, probably signed up earlier in the open-enrollment period, while the healthier people signed up closer to the March 31 deadline — after the time span Express Scripts looked at.</p> \n<p>It's possible the full long-term trend won't come to light until a few years of enrollment in the exchanges. For the first year, many insurance companies padded their premiums in expectation of a sicker pool and higher costs. But experts expect uptake among healthier people to increase over time; if that doesn't happen, health-care costs — and premiums — could increase.</p> \n<p>But since Express Scripts's analysis looked at two months before Obamacare's enrollment period closed, Jenna Stento, senior manager at Avalere Health, says it's hard to predict whether healthier people will eventually — or already did — sign up for Obamacare.</p> \n<p>It also might seem counter-intuitive to worry about sicker people getting health coverage they need, Levitt and Stento acknowledge. But if there are too many sick people in the insurance pool, costs could reach a point where those sick people are once again priced out — and not getting the care they need as a result.</p>"
The best evidence we have that Obamacare is working,http://www.vox.com/2014/4/9/5597600/the-best-evidence-we-have-that-obamacare-is-working,"John Boehner got this one very, very wrong.","<p><span>On March 13th, House Speaker John Boehner held a press conference. By that point, Obamacare enrollment was beginning to accelerate. But Boehner thought it was an illusion. He wanted to change the narrative. And so he made a startling claim: Obamacare, he said, had led to fewer people having health insurance.</span></p> \n<blockquote> \n<p><b>Reporter: </b>Mr. Speaker, you said a minute ago there are fewer people today with health insurance than when the law was passed. I want to make sure I understand. You're saying that Obamacare has resulted in a net loss of insurance?</p> \n<p><b>Boehner: </b>I believe that to be the case. When you look at the 6 million Americans who have lost their policies and some &mdash; they claim 4.2 million people who have signed up &mdash; I don't know how many have actually paid for it &mdash; that would indicate to me a net loss of people with health insurance. And I actually do believe that to be the case.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Boehner was going off of claims and guesstimates. He admits as much in his answer: this is what he believes, not what he knows. But&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RR656.html"">a new report</a> from the Rand Corporation gives us a fuller picture than ever before. And so now we know: John Boehner was wrong.</p> \n<h3>1) 9.3 million more people have health insurance</h3> \n<p>Washington has been tracking enrollment in Obamacare's exchanges and, less precisely, in Medicaid. The Rand study uses a nationally representative sample to track vastly more data: they know roughly how many people were buying insurance from their employers, from insurers, and much more. They also know how many people were losing insurance, either through cancellations, or because employers were dropping them, or because they just stopped paying premiums.</p> \n<p>Add all the gains and all the losses together and you get Rand's bottom line: 14.5 million people gained coverage, 5.2 million people lost coverage, and so the net change since 2013 was 9.3 million people getting health insurance.</p> \n<h3>2) An unexpected Obamacare success: more employer coverage</h3> \n<p><img alt=""Where_the_uninsured_got_insurance__in_millions"" class=""photo"" src=""http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/assets/4267253/Where_the_uninsured_got_insurance__in_millions.png""></p> \n<p>One major finding in the Rand study: on net, more than 8 million people gained insurance through their employers. And most of those people were previously uninsured. That's a huge deal.</p> \n<p>Rand speculates that some of the increase might be people buying insurance so they don't have the pay the individual mandate, and some of the people might be getting new jobs that offer insurance because the economy is improving. Either way, predictions that Obamacare would lead to employers throwing people off insurance are, at this point, proving completely wrong.</p> \n<h3>3) The uninsured population has fallen from 20.5 percent to 15.8 percent</h3> \n<p>That's a sharper drop than&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.gallup.com/poll/168248/uninsured-rate-lowest-2008.aspx"">Gallup</a> has found, though both surveys show that the number of uninsured is falling fast.</p> \n<h3>4) People are always losing health insurance</h3> \n<p><img alt=""Chrun_twitter"" class=""photo"" src=""http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/assets/4267349/chrun_twitter.jpg""></p> \n<p>Something the Rand study does a nice job of showing is churn. Health researchers know that people are always gaining and losing health insurance. Folks get fired, or they get hired. They become poor enough to get Medicaid, or rich enough that they no longer qualify. The question is whether the gains outweigh the losses.</p> \n<p>This churn has been a particular problem for Obamacare because the law is being blamed for the kinds of insurance losses that happen all the time anyway. In a way, the law has been a huge boon to employers who wanted to cut benefits to save money, or insurers who wanted to close down an insurance pool that was no longer profitable. Now they can just blame Obamacare.</p> \n<p>The Rand study is really the first that lets us see the full extent of that churn. For instance, it tells us that about two million people who had insurance-based coverage in 2013 lost it by March of 2014. &nbsp;But more than seven million people who were uninsured in 2013 got employer-based insurance by March of 2014.</p> \n<p>If you want to dig deep into this issue, there's an interesting&nbsp;<a href=""https://twitter.com/bdomenech/status/453932663557328896"">Twitter conversation</a> on it between Ben Domenech and Adrianna McIntyre.</p> \n<h3>5) Many more people have gained insurance since the study</h3> \n<p>Rand is very upfront about the fact that much of the data for their survey was collected in early March &mdash; before Obamacare's&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.facebook.com/ezraklein/posts/10103216176308716"">massive, end-of-month surge</a>.</p> \n<p>Moreover, enrollment in Medicaid is still open, and Obamacare is also still signing people up into the exchanges through various deadlines and loopholes. So it's certain that hundreds of thousands &mdash; and perhaps millions &mdash; more people have gotten insurance since the Rand survey ended. So think of this as a low-end estimate.</p> \n<h3>6) 80 percent of people are unaffected by Obamacare.</h3> \n<p>Obamacare was built to leave most people alone. And the Rand survey shows that it's succeeding in that. ""The ACA has not led to changes in the health insurance coverage of most people,"" Rand says. ""Among adults, fully 80 percent still had the same form of coverage in March 2014 as in September 2013.""</p>"

How does a hepatitis C pill, for example, get to cost $1,000? Here is a rundown of how drug companies set prices &mdash; and policy changes that could make the system less expensive overall.</p> \n<h3>How are drug prices set?</h3> \n<p><img alt=""144097820"" class=""photo"" src=""http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/assets/4285255/144097820.jpg""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">These can really vary in price.

They initially set the price to recoup upfront costs from the lengthy, costly research and development (R&amp;D) process and, of course, make a profit.</p> \n<p>But that's not the end of the line. After drug companies set the initial price, health-care organizations, such as hospitals, pharmacies, insurers, and their representatives, step in to negotiate lower prices. The goal is to bring down prices to levels that both payers and patients can more easily afford. This negotiated price is the one that an insured patients will see and pay for.</p> \n<h3>What makes drugs expensive in the first place?</h3> \n<p><img src=""http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/assets/4277181/154736209.jpg"" class=""photo"" alt=""154736209""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Nice profits.

With this kind of control, developers can then set prices almost at will &mdash; sometimes to <a href=""http://www.uspharmacist.com/content/s/216/c/35249/"">profit margins exceeding 90 percent</a>.</p> \n<h3>How do private groups negotiate down drug prices?</h3> \n<p><img src=""http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/assets/4276693/51144089.jpg"" class=""photo"" alt=""51144089""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Oligopolies help negotiate lower prices. Christopher Furlong / Getty Images News</p> \n<p>The specifics of the negotiations and groups involved depend on the type of drug and who's buying it. But the general idea is that major organizations use their large customer bases to bargain for a better value, as long as health outcomes aren't sacrificed.</p> \n<p>Take, for example, Gilead's hepatitis C drug.  Gilead's product currently controls the market, since its cure rate is unmatched by any other available drug. But once cheaper, equally effective competitors hit the market starting in 2015, Express Scripts  hopes to pit them against Gilead. If Gilead doesn't reduce its price as a result, Express Scripts will tell the health plans it represents, which cover nearly 100 million Americans, to avoid Gilead's drug and instead buy the cheaper options.</p> \n<p>This plays out at some level whether it's a drug bought at a pharmacy or doctor-administered drug. The difference is pharmacy-bought drugs are typically negotiated through large representative organizations like Express Scripts and CVS Caremark, while doctors and hospitals negotiate prices for doctor-administered drugs.</p> \n<h3>Can drug prices always be negotiated down?</h3> \n<p><img src=""http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/assets/4276621/148950594.jpg"" class=""photo"" alt=""148950594""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Buying drugs alone limits your purchasing power. McClatchy-Tribune</p> \n<p>No. There are some instances in which one side holds so much or so little leverage that negotiations aren't feasible.</p> \n<p>A drug company, for instance, might have the leverage to refuse to negotiate, typically because it holds exclusive rights to a drug that works better than everything else on the market. This is what's happening with Gilead; since its hepatitis C drug works better than anything else on the market, it can set a high price without concerns about competition.</p> \n<p>On the other end of the spectrum, a single uninsured patient, as a single customer, doesn't have the negotiating power of large industry groups that represent millions of Americans. So an uninsured patient will typically pay the higher, non-negotiated price.</p> \n<h3>Does the federal government negotiate for lower drug prices?</h3> \n<p><img src=""http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/assets/4284683/13011820434_7172e92e64_o.jpg"" class=""photo"" alt=""13011820434_7172e92e64_o"" height=""399"" width=""593""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">There's not much the president can do about expensive drugs.

And since Medicare generally reimburses doctors with the price of a drug plus 6 percent, doctors are incentivized to use higher-cost drugs &mdash; 6 percent of $1,000 is a lot more than 6 percent of $100, after all.</p> \n<h3>What happens to drug prices when patents expire?</h3> \n<p><img src=""http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/assets/4277213/151045297.jpg"" class=""photo"" alt=""151045297""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">These are generic drugs. BSIP / Universal Images Group</p> \n<p>The short answer is prices drop. But the extent of the price drop varies depending on how many suppliers jump at the opportunity.</p> \n<p>If a drug is very complex, it might not lead to a huge price drop because many manufactures won't have the expertise required to develop generic competitors. This is sometimes the case with specialty drugs, such as those that treat complicated diseases like cancer and HIV. Two researchers at the University of Chicago and MIT, for example, <a href=""http://www.nber.org/papers/w20016"">found</a> price declines of 38-46.4 percent among doctor-administered drugs and 25-26 percent among oral drugs. So there were clear drops in price, but they weren't massive.</p> \n<p>With simpler drugs, patent expiration can produce a massive price drop. Miller of Express Script estimates some generic drugs can cost as little as 10 percent of a patented product.</p> \n<p>But keep in mind patented drugs aren't immune to all competition. A different developer can introduce another patented drug  that works differently but produces similar health outcomes. That's what will start happening in the hepatitis C market next year, as other manufacturers introduce patented drugs to compete with Gilead's product. In this type of situation, Miller says his organization can negotiate prices down by 20-40 percent by getting companies to fight for the better price.</p> \n<h3>What policy changes could further reduce drug prices?</h3> \n<p><img src=""http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/assets/4277679/129173207.jpg"" class=""photo"" alt=""129173207""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">These guys could do a lot, if they acted. Brendan Hoffman / Getty Images News</p> \n<p>There are a lot of potential changes. The United States regulates and restricts drug prices far less than other developed nations.</p> \n<p>Congress could let Medicare, which covers more than 49 million people, negotiate lower drug prices. The left-leaning Center for Economic and Policy Research <a href=""http://www.cepr.net/documents/publications/state-medicare-drug-2013-03.pdf"">predicts</a> that allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices would save the federal government $230-$541  billion over 10 years, by reducing Medicare-purchased drugs to lower price levels seen in other developed countries.</p> \n<p>But conservative opponents <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/13/washington/13medicare.html"">worry</a> that letting Medicare negotiate drug prices would give the federal government too much  power over the private market and stifle innovation as a result.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""right"">The United States regulates and restricts drug prices far less than other developed nations</q></p> \n<p>An even more extreme solution would allow the government to cap and set drug prices, similar to what <a href=""http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/20/3/92.full"">Canada does</a>. But conservatives, who already fear letting the federal government into price negotiations, object to that much government interference in the private market.</p> \n<p>The federal government could, alternatively, relax its patent laws. That would allow generic drugs to enter the market much sooner, and those generics, as noted by Miller, come at a much lower price than the patented product.</p> \n<p>The question is how much this change would affect R&amp;D. Part of the reason companies take on the costly R&amp;D process today is because they know they'll have full control of their discoveries for (<a href=""http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/ucm079031.htm#How%20many%20years%20is%20a%20patent%20granted%20for?"">in theory</a>) two decades. If that control is diminished through relaxed patent laws or government price controls, the incentive to undertake a costly R&amp;D process could be diminished.</p> \n<p><a href=""http://www.nber.org/papers/w11114"">A 2005 study</a> supported the potential damage to R&amp;D investments. Researchers Thomas Abbott and John Vernon found cutting drug prices by 40-50 percent in the US would lead to 30-60 percent fewer R&amp;D projects.</p> \n<p>To make up for the loss of private investment, left-leaning economist Dean Baker <a href=""http://books.google.com/books?id=7OZJaph_trYC&amp;pg=PA132&amp;lpg=PA132&amp;dq=dean+baker+patents+drugs+public+funding&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=n9N2euyy0M&amp;sig=QuV4STtq7EzFoFlJTwkv-PV5T_M&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=H01HU9uaNoSO2wW8loDgDw&amp;ved=0CGsQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=dean%20baker%20patents%20drugs%20public%20funding&amp;f=false"">suggests</a> direct public funding as one alternative to the current system. Under Baker's scheme, researchers would team up with the government to produce new drugs, and these drugs would then be available to the public at generic drug prices.</p> \n<p>Others, particularly drug companies, claim high drug prices are a result of too much government regulation. Economist Gary Becker <a href=""http://home.uchicago.edu/gbecker/Businessweek/BW/2002/09_16_2002.pdf"">argues</a> relaxed FDA rules would reduce the length and cost of the R&amp;D process. But consumer advocates <a href=""http://www.citizen.org/Page.aspx?pid=2339"">say</a> weaker standards would make drugs less safe.</p>"

And that's why Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius can <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/4/10/5602654/report-hhs-secretary-sebelius-to-resign"">resign</a>.</p> \n<p>Calls for Sebelius's resignation were almost constant after Obamacare's catastrophic launch. The problem wasn't just that Sebelius had presided over the construction of a fantastically expensive web site that flatly didn't work.  It was that she didn't know healthcare.gov was going to instantly, systemically fail. And so the White House didn't know that healthcare.gov was going to instantly, systemically fail. <span>The demands that Sebelius to step down — or be fired — were as deafening inside the building as outside of it. </span></p> \n<p>But President Obama refused. As National Journal's Major Garrett <a href=""http://www.nationaljournal.com/daily/white-house-masked-fears-of-obamacare-collapse-20140401"">reported</a>, Obama believes that ""scaring people with a ceremonial firing deepens fear, turns allies against one another, makes them risk-averse, and saps productivity."" Moreover, there was too much to be done to fire one of the few people who knew how to finish the job. Sebelius would stay. The White House wouldn't panic in ways that made it harder to save the law.</p> \n<p>The evidence has <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/4/9/5597600/the-best-evidence-we-have-that-obamacare-is-working"">piled up</a> in recent weeks<span> that the strategy worked. Obamacare's first year, despite a truly horrific start, was a success. More than 7 million people look to have signed up for health insurance through the exchanges. Millions more have signed up through Medicaid. And millions beyond that have signed up for insurance through their employers. </span></p> \n<p>Healthcare.gov isn't perfect, but it works. We don't yet know how many young people signed up in March, but it's clear that there are enough of them to keep premiums stable in 2015. It's clear that insurers are going to stick with the program in 2015, and compete hard to sign up next year's wave of young, healthy applicants.</p> \n<p>Even Republicans committed to the law's repeal are admitting that the law is back on its expected track. ""The rollout made Obamacare's collapse seem like a possibility,"" wrote Ramesh Ponnuru at <a href=""http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2014-04-07/obamacare-isn-t-failing-now-what"">Bloomberg View</a>. But ""now that it's resolved, the debate continues basically along the same lines that everyone expected a year ago. The law will continue to be implemented,  with the administration making whatever revisions it thinks necessary.""</p> \n<p>The White House says Sebelius notified the President in March that ""she felt confident in the trajectory for enrollment and implementation,"" and that once open enrollment ended, ""it would be the right time to transition the Department to new leadership.""</p> \n<p><span>In other words, the law has won its survival.</span><span> T</span>he Obama administration can exhale. Personnel changes can be made. A new team — led by Office of Management and Budget Director Sylvia Matthews Burwell, who the White House calls a proven manager— can be brought in to continue to improve the law. And Sebelius can leave with her head held high. She can leave with the law she helped build looking, shockingly, like a success.</p>"

Do e-cigarettes kill you? Researchers donâ€™t know.,http://www.vox.com/2014/4/15/5610840/e-cigarettes,"What we do know: they sometimes explode. Like, literally explode.","<p>The Food and Drug Administration currently doesn't regulate e-cigarettes (short for electronic cigarettes) — but some Congressional Democrats want that to change.</p> \n<p>Sen. Dick Durbin (D-IL), Rep. Henry Waxman (D-CA), and other congressional Democrats pressed the agency Monday to restrict e-cigarette sales to teens. They released <a href=""http://www.durbin.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/files/serve/?File_id=81d14ff7-f2f6-4856-af9d-c20c0b138f8f"">a report</a> that found e-cigarette makers market the devices in ways that might appeal to youth, by offering candy and fruit flavors and advertising on television and radio.</p> \n<p>The report serves as a good reminder that e-cigarettes — first introduced in 2006 — are a relatively new product that we don't know a ton about. The research is still ongoing about what harm they pose, and countries, including the US, are still sorting out how, exactly, e-cigarettes ought to be regulated.</p> \n<h3>How do e-cigarettes work?</h3> \n<p><img alt=""170419028"" class=""photo"" src=""http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/assets/4299021/170419028.jpg""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">An e-cigarette unscrewed. Oli Scarff / Getty Images News</p> \n<p>E-cigarettes are slender electronic devices that imitate conventional smoking by vaporizing liquid nicotine. Using an e-cigarette can give a buzz similar to smoking cigarettes — only the buzz comes through vapor, not highly toxic cigarette smoke.</p> \n<p>When a user inhales on the e-cigarette mouthpiece, it powers up the device. The e-cigarette then vaporizes some of the liquid nicotine, which is located in an insertable cartridge. The vaporized nicotine then flows through the device and into the user's mouth. Each hit has about 90 percent of the nicotine from a conventional cigarette puff, <a href=""http://www.popsci.com/article/technology/how-it-works-electronic-cigarette"">according to Popular Science</a>.</p> \n<h3>What makes e-cigarette vapor different than tobacco smoke?</h3> \n<p><img alt=""478391197"" class=""photo"" src=""http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/assets/4298965/478391197.jpg""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">That vapor is odorless.

Instead, they vaporize liquid nicotine (with perhaps some flavoring).</p> \n<p>Conventional cigarettes, on the other hand, contain tobacco and all the additives tobacco companies add to the substance to make the product taste or feel a certain way.</p> \n<p>Another key difference is tobacco is burned and inhaled as pungent smoke, while e-cigarettes just heat up liquid nicotine to turn it into an odorless vapor.</p> \n<h3>How many people use e-cigarettes?</h3> \n<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in 2013 found <a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6235a6.htm"">6.8 percent of youth in grades 6–12</a> and <a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2013/p0228_electronic_cigarettes.html"">6 percent of adults</a> have used e-cigarettes.

That means using e-cigarettes even a few times could lead to lifelong cravings for the drug.</p> \n<p>And nicotine also poses some health concerns. Researchers from the University of California at Irvine found in <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2746456/"">their review of the research</a> that nicotine alone — the main substance found in e-cigarettes — strains development for fetuses, newborns, children, and teenagers. Adolescents exposed to nicotine in particular showed enhanced vulnerability to impulsivity and mood disorders, among other issues.</p> \n<p>The CDC also <a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6313a4.htm"">found</a> the rise of e-cigarettes led to hundreds of phone calls to nationwide poison centers each year related to the product and liquid nicotine. Callers complained about vomiting, nausea, and eye irritation, and more than half the cases involved children five and younger.</p> \n<h3>Do e-cigarettes help people quit smoking?</h3> \n<p><img alt=""481986977"" class=""photo"" src=""http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/assets/4298949/481986977.jpg""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">This isn't an actual cigarette; it's an e-cigarette.

The analysis found e-cigarettes, with or without nicotine, appeared similarly effective as nicotine patches.</p> \n<p>In both studies, however, less than one in 10 of the studied population reportedly quit smoking altogether after taking up e-cigarettes. And, in the Italian study, the quit and reduced-consumption rates fell as people went back to smoking further into the year.</p> \n<p>There's also research that indicates e-cigarettes could have the opposite effect: they might push people to start smoking. <a href=""https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2014/03/112316/e-cigarettes-gateway-nicotine-addiction-us-teens-says-ucsf-study"">A study</a> from the University of California in San Francisco found use of e-cigarettes was associated with higher odds of smoking among adolescents, and adolescents who experimented with e-cigarettes were less likely to abstain from picking up conventional smoking. Even worse, adolescents who smoked conventional cigarettes and e-cigarettes also smoked more cigarettes per day than those who only smoked cigarettes.</p> \n<p>The problem, as researchers noted, is nicotine is still addictive, even if it comes in an e-cigarette. And, as the Mayo Clinic <a href=""http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/nicotine-dependence/basics/definition/con-20014452"">explains</a>, a nicotine addiction is what drives people to consume tobacco all their lives despite the health problems it causes.</p> \n<h3></h3> \n<h3>How does the federal government regulate e-cigarettes?</h3> \n<p><img alt=""158751116"" class=""photo"" src=""http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/assets/4299157/158751116.jpg""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Congress's favorite traffic sign.

The right canâ€™t admit that Obamacare is working,http://www.vox.com/2014/4/14/5613094/obamacare-derangement-syndrome,Obamacare Derangement Syndrome is a dangerous thing.,"<p>On Thursday, I <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/4/10/5602670/kathleen-sebelius-is-resigning-because-obamacare-has-won"">stated the obvious</a>: HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius's resignation was timed to follow news of <a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/obamacare/what-is-obamacare"">Obamacare's</a> surprising success signing up 7.5 million people for private insurance.</p> \n<p>Conventional wisdom was that Sebelius would resign back in October or November, when Healthcare.gov was a mess and the White House needed a scapegoat. Like many others, I thought Sebelius — and a few others — <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/12/13/why-hasnt-anyone-been-fired-over-healthcare-gov/"">should be fired</a>.</p> \n<p>But for better or worse, President Obama doesn't like to fire people amidst crises, even if the crises are partly their fault. And so Sebelius's resignation, coming on the heels of a rush of good news for Obamacare, is evidence that the White House considers the Obamacare  crisis is over. With 7.5 million people (and rising!) signed up for <a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/obamacare/what-is-a-health-insurance-exchange"">the insurance exchanges</a> and 3.5 million people (and rising!) signed up for Medicaid the law is likely here to stay — which means the White House can finally exhale, and begin changing the team that runs it.</p> \n<p>This blindingly obvious analysis made a lot of Obamacare critics very, very angry. Sen. Ted Cruz, for instance, took the column on in <a href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/ted-cruz-ezra-klein-obamacare-2014-4"">a speech</a> in New Hampshire:</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>If you listen to Democrats, if you listen to the media - although, I repeat myself - they will tell you there is no hope. They will tell you we cannot turn this around. They will tell you you cannot stop Obamacare. They will tell you that Kathleen Sebelius resigning is a result of Obamacare's success. Well if that's true, then I hope every Democrat will follow her path and resign, as well!</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Sen.

For those suffering from ODS, all bad Obamacare news is good news, and all good Obamacare news is spin. In this world, delays of minor provisions in the law prove that the entire structure is collapsing, while surges of millions of people enrolling in insurance don't prove anything at all.</p> \n<p>ODS has kept Republicans from updating their mental model of how Obamacare is doing. To them, the law's disastrous rollout proved that it was doomed. The fact that it recovered beyond anyone's expectations — literally, not a single analyst or policymaker I spoke to in December thought it credible that the exchanges would sign up 7 million by April, much less 7.5 million — hasn't made much of an impression.</p> \n<p>Today, Republicans are thrilled by Sebelius's resignation: It means that the Obama administration needs to get her successor, OMB Director Sylvia Matthews Burwell, confirmed by the Senate. And that's an opportunity for Republicans to relitigate the many failures of Obamacare.</p> \n<p><q class=""right"" aria-hidden=""true"">So long as Ted Cruz is promising Obamacare can be stopped, no Republican can outline a plan to tweak it</q></p> \n<p>But it's coming at a moment when Obamacare's successes are getting tougher and tougher to deny. The law signed up more than 7.5 million people in the exchanges, more than 3.5 million people in Medicaid, and it led <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/4/9/5597600/the-best-evidence-we-have-that-obamacare-is-working"">millions more</a> to get health care through their employers or directly through insurers. Premiums are lower than the Congressional Budget Office predicted when the law passed, and insurers are already thinking about how to compete for applicants in 2015. The White House has a much better story to tell than anyone — including me — thought possible in December.</p> \n<p>There are still many good critiques to make of Obamacare. But Republicans don't want to critique Obamacare. They want to stop it. Repeal it. They want to make it the hill big-government liberalism dies upon. And those in the party who know better continue to be cowed by those in the party who don't. So long as Ted Cruz is going to New Hampshire promising that Obamacare can be stopped, no Republican can step before the faithful and outline a plan for how it can be tweaked.</p> \n<p>The irony of this is that Obamacare's successes are, in many cases, conservatism's successes. The individual mandate is a conservative idea — and it's working. Liberals were skeptical that private insurers would compete on price even absent a public option — but they are. High-deductible health plans are a longtime conservative solution for health costs — and Obamacare is spreading them far and wide. But conservatives can't take credit for any of this, much less build on it.</p> \n<p>For the White House, the new hearings present an opportunity. Public opinion always lags a bit behind policy reality. Obamacare, weirdly, became more popular in its disastrous first weeks. But then its numbers plummeted as people realized Healthcare.gov really was a disaster. Now that Obamacare is recovered the White House needs to somehow get that message out to the public — and even to<a style=""background-color: #ffffff; line-height: 1.5;"" href=""http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/04/14/obamacare-the-unknown-ideal-continued/""> liberals</a><span>.

The roll-out really was a disaster, the law remains unpopular, and estimations of the Obama administration's competence are still low. T<span>he public would gladly flock to a political party that had a real plan for improving Obamacare, and a serious claim to being able to manage it more professionally.

That's an increase from 24 million, the agency's last projection.</p> \n<p>But here's what's most surprising: CBO thinks that, even as the exchanges insure slightly more people, the overall price tag for everyone goes down. It now expects the federal government to spend $104 billion less on the coverage expansion.</p> \n<p>CBO's new forecasts reflect the fact that premiums on the exchange have come in slightly lower than initially expected. The ones being sold this year tend to pay doctors less and have ""narrower networks of providers."" When health plans contract with fewer doctors, they typically can negotiate cheaper prices with the few physicians they do include in their networks.</p> \n<p>When premiums are lower, that means the federal government pays less to subsidize people buying insurance. CBO says the federal government is, on average, spending $300 less per person on insurance subsidies than it had expected.</p> \n<h3>Only 6 million people are expected to have exchange coverage this year</h3> \n<p>The White House has announced that&nbsp;<a href=""https://twitter.com/WhiteHouse/status/454748971286556672"">7.5 million </a>people signed up for coverage on the exchange this year, but the CBO still isn't changing its prediction that 6 million people will have insurance through the marketplace in 2014.</p> \n<p>What explains the discrepancy? Mostly the expectation that not everyone buying coverage right now will keep it all year. Some of the 7.5 million people, for example, will likely get jobs and transition into employer-sponsored plan (something that becomes especially likely as<a href=""http://www.foxbusiness.com/economy-policy/2014/04/04/us-adds-12000-march-jobs-unemployment-rate-holds-at-67/""> the economy adds jobs</a>). With some of this churn on and off the exchange the CBO thinks that, at any given time, about 6 million people will have a plan they bought on the exchange.</p> \n<p>The 6 million estimate also leaves out anyone who signs up for an insurance plan but never pays their first month's premium.</p>"

Study: 12 million US adults are misdiagnosed each year,http://www.vox.com/2014/4/17/5621568/theres-a-good-chance-you-were-misdiagnosed-in-your-last-trip-to-the,And about half those misdiagnoses could harm the patient.,"<p>At least one in 20 American adults is misdiagnosed each year, according to a study of primary care and cancer patients published Wednesday in BMJ.</p> \n<p>That works out to about 12 million people being told annually that something is wrong with them that isn't, researchers from the<span> VA Center for Innovations in Quality, Effectiveness and Safety and University of Texas at Houston say. And based on previous studies, researchers concluded that roughly half of those misdiagnoses have the potential to harm a patient.</span></p> \n<h3>Misdiagnoses can be deadly</h3> \n<p><img alt=""151051684"" class=""photo"" src=""http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/assets/4310981/151051684.jpg""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Let's hope he's getting it right. BSIP / Universal Images Group</p> \n<p>Hardeep Singh, one of the researchers involved in the study, says the findings show a lot of patients could be at risk.</p> \n<p>""The harm from misdiagnosis occurs when the correct treatment is delayed or when you get an inappropriate treatment or test,"" he says.</p> \n<p>If doctors diagnose a cough brought on by lung cancer as a cough brought on by a cold, for example, the cancer is going to have time to spread and, therefore, become more difficult to treat. In this scenario, it would be much better if the doctor ran the proper tests, caught the lung cancer in its infancy, and went after the cancer with more precise, successful treatments.</p> \n<h3>The study's misdiagnosis rate, although high, might be a conservative estimate<br>\n</h3> \n<p><img alt=""161225961"" class=""photo"" src=""http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/assets/4311123/161225961.jpg""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">It could be worse, if this guy doesn't get it right. Cyrus McCrimmon / Denver Post</p> \n<p>Singh's team looked at medical records to find out when doctors failed to make correct or timely diagnoses in primary care visits and cases involving lung cancer and colon cancer. If a patient with a cough, for example, was diagnosed with lung cancer on his first doctor visit and medical records later showed the patient actually had a cold, that would count as a misdiagnosis. The team then added up those misdiagnoses and extrapolated their findings to the US adult population, hence the 1-in-20 rate.</p> \n<p>But because the study focused on primary care visits and only two types of cancer, Singh acknowledges the analysis neglected other medical problems susceptible to misdiagnoses. And even more issues might have been left out of the medical records Singh and his team analyzed.</p> \n<p><q class=""right"" aria-hidden=""true"">Singh says the 5-percent MISDIAGNOSIS RATE IS PROBABLY TOO LOW</q></p> \n<p>That doesn't, however, mean the 5-percent error rate is too high of an estimate. On the contrary, Singh says the estimate is probably too low because the medical problems left out, particularly some of the rarer diseases, are more difficult to properly diagnose.</p> \n<p>The study points to other, less robust measures that found even higher rates of misdiagnoses: a <a href=""http://consumersunion.org/pdf/medical-error-poll-309.pdf"">patient survey</a>, for instance, put the rate of diagnostic errors at more than 10 percent.</p> \n<p>For Singh, the purpose of his study was to start a conversation with stronger methodology that might invite further research into the issue.</p> \n<p>""We&rsquo;ve had this problem for a while,"" he says. ""We just haven&rsquo;t been able to measure it.""</p> \n<h3>Various issues, from doctors to patients, cause misdiagnoses</h3> \n<p><img alt=""170649707"" class=""photo"" src=""http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/assets/4311037/170649707.jpg""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Both sides are to blame. Damien Meyer / AFP</p> \n<p>The most obvious person to blame for a misdiagnosis is, of course, the doctor. And Singh, a doctor himself, acknowledges doctors and their care teams are sometimes to blame &mdash; due to a lack of education about a specific medical problem, poor communication, or a failure to check up on a patient after a visit.</p> \n<p>But patients are also at some fault, Singh says. Sometimes patients aren't very good at communicating their medical problems; patients, for instance, might not share their full family histories or follow up with a doctor if bad symptoms persist weeks after a visit.</p> \n<p>Singh points to systemic problems in the health-care system, too. He says bad technology &mdash; paper instead of electronic records, for instance &mdash; holds back a lot of doctors and hospitals. And there's a perverse incentive, Singh explains, in most of the US health-care system to run up more medical treatments with little concern about value, since doctors are paid for each service and not the quality of health outcomes.</p> \n<p>So there's no single answer. But Singh says that, with more research into the issue, the specifics of misdiagnoses and how to solve them through new policy initiatives should become clearer.</p>"

Way more than 8 million people have signed up for Obamacare,http://www.vox.com/2014/4/18/5627890/way-more-than-8-million-people-have-signed-up-for-obamacare,Millions of sign-ups among young adults and new Medicaid enrollees extend the health care law's reach.,"<p><span>The White House announced Thursday that </span><a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/4/17/5625206/obamacare-final-enrollment-numbers"" style=""background-color: #ffffff; line-height: 1.5;"">8 million people </a><span>had signed up for insurance through the </span><a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/obamacare/what-is-a-health-insurance-exchange#E5385827"" style=""line-height: 1.5;"">exchanges</a><span>. That number is bigger than expected &mdash; but it only captures about half the people who have signed up for coverage through the health care law's new programs.</span></p> \n<p>The Affordable Care Act's expansion of insurance coverage is sprawling, including some programs that started four years ago and some that started six months ago. And that means the health care law has a reach that extends pretty far beyond Healthcare.gov.</p> \n<h3>About 3 million people have signed up for Medicaid since October</h3> \n<p>Not all of that <a href=""http://medicaid.gov/AffordableCareAct/Medicaid-Moving-Forward-2014/Downloads/February-2014-Enrollment-Report.pdf"">enrollment </a>is attributable to the Affordable Care Act &mdash; but federal data suggests a good chunk of it is.</p> \n<p>The health care law gives states the option to expand their Medicaid programs to cover everyone who is below 133 percent of the federal poverty line (about $15,000 for an individual). Twenty-six states and the District of Columbia have signed on to the expansion. Their Medicaid enrollment has grown much faster than the 24 states that haven't expanded their Medicaid programs.</p> \n<p><img src=""http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/assets/4320275/medicaid_enrollment_changes.png"" class=""photo"" alt=""Medicaid_enrollment_changes""></p> \n<p>The federal government has not provided a breakdown yet of which people signing up are newly eligible under Obamacare and who would've had access to the program regardless of the insurance expansion.</p> \n<p>Some of the previously eligible people who signed up in the past few months might be evidence of what researchers call a ""woodwork effect."" These are people who could have signed up months, maybe years, ago, but only learned that they qualified for help because of the flurry of publicity around the Affordable Care Act. Whether or not to count these people as Obamacare enrollees isn't totally clear: they would have qualified for help without Obamacare but might have never known to sign up.</p> \n<h3>3.1 million young adults have gained coverage, many by joining their parents' insurance</h3> \n<p><span>One of the earliest parts of Obamacare to start was a new requirement that insurance plans cover dependents up to age 26. Prior to the health care law, many insurers ended coverage when a dependent had graduated from school.</span></p> \n<p>The most recent estimates available suggest that about <a href=""http://aspe.hhs.gov/aspe/gaininginsurance/rb.shtml"">3.1 million</a> young adults between 19 and 25 have gained insurance coverage since this part of the health care law started in September 2010. We don't know for sure that these people were all joining their parents' coverage. But the evidence that the health law played a role is pretty compelling: young adults between 19 and 25 increased by <a href=""http://aspe.hhs.gov/aspe/gaininginsurance/rb.shtml"">5.1 percentage points</a> more than any other age group between late 2010 and 2011.</p> \n<h3>Other sources of coverage are growing, too</h3> \n<p>In advance of the <a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/obamacare/what-is-the-individual-mandate"">individual mandate</a>, research suggests people are signing up for employer-sponsored insurance in greater numbers &mdash; and buying individual plans off the exchanges. These are not people getting financial help to purchase insurance through Obamacare. But they are likely people being nudged in the direction of purchasing coverage because of the health law's new requirements.</p> \n<p>Charles Gaba &mdash; the guy <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/4/4/5572310/the-invaluable-charles-gaba"">who knows</a> Obamacare enrollment numbers better than anybody &mdash; estimates that between <a href=""http://acasignups.net/spreadsheet"">2 to 5 million</a> people have purchased individual policies outside the exchange.</p> \n<p>A lot of these people are likely replacing plans they already had before Obamacare. These might be higher income people who didn't qualify for insurance subsidies and got fed up with Healthcare.gov. But this group is also likely to include some people with pre-existing conditions who, up until now, were shut out of the insurance market.</p> \n<p>Lastly, research from the RAND Corporation suggests that about<a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/4/8/5594110/survey-9-3-million-gained-health-insurance-following-obamacare""> 7.2 million</a> people have gained employer-sponsored coverage since the health law's insurance expansion began. It's hard to know here how much of this has to do with a recovering economy &mdash; where more people are gaining jobs with health benefits &mdash; and how much it reflects a greater take-up rate of insurance as people get ready to comply with Obamacare's individual mandate.</p>"
Bad news: you probably have herpes and don't know it,http://www.vox.com/2014/4/23/5628696/you-probably-have-herpes,I'm not even kidding. Check out these stats.,"<p>Yes, I'm talking to you. About <a href=""http://jid.oxfordjournals.org/content/209/3/325"">70%</a> of Americans ages 14 to 49 have herpes, that is either the HSV-1 or HSV-2 versions<span>. These viruses used to be clearly demarcated as oral and genital herpes, but these days it's clear that </span><a href=""http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/healthlibrary/conditions/oral_health/mouth_infections_85,P00888/"" style=""background-color: #ffffff; line-height: 1.5;"">both</a><span> can cause both types of infections. </span></p> \n<p><a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/std/herpes/stdfact-herpes-detailed.htm"" style=""line-height: 1.5;"">Genital herpes</a> is one of the most stigmatized of STI's, and it's far more common than most people think. But learning that you have it might just cause you more social harm than actual good. It's something that experts love to debate. Here are four facts you probably didn't want to know about herpes.</p> \n<h3><span>1. There's a good chance that you have herpes</span></h3> \n<p><img alt=""Herpes.age.5"" class=""photo"" src=""http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/assets/4373359/Herpes.age.5.jpg""><br><span>If you catch chlamydia or gonorrhea, you can have it treated with antibiotics and it will go away. However, there is no cure for herpes. So once someone has it, she has it for life. </span><span>Over an entire population, the cases just add up over time. This means that middle-aged adults have some shockingly high herpes rates. For example, 50 to 70 percent of single women aged 45 to 50 </span><a href=""http://commonhealth.wbur.org/2011/04/latest-genital-herpes"">have herpes</a><span>. (By the way, the chart above is for herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2), aka genital herpes. The other type is ""oral herpes,"" HSV-1, although both viruses can infect people in both, um, places.)</span></p> \n<h3>2. There's an even higher chance if you're single</h3> \n<p><img alt=""Herpes_bauer_et_al_2010"" class=""photo"" src=""http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/assets/4323623/Herpes_Bauer_et_al_2010.png"">Maybe this isn't so surprising. But if you are single, you might want to take a look at the graph above. The red and purple are actual herpes rates. The solid lines are single people, and the dashed lines are people who are married or cohabiting. It's from <a href=""http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/10/359"">this paper</a>.</p> \n<h3><span>3. If you have herpes, you probably don't know it</span></h3> \n<p><img alt=""Screen_shot_2014-04-22_at_5.17.02_pm"" class=""photo"" src=""http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/assets/4373407/Screen_Shot_2014-04-22_at_5.17.02_PM.jpg""><br><span>Most people infected with herpes don't ever have symptoms. And most routine STI testing doesn't look for herpes, either. What? Yes. So that's why most people don't know that they have it. (The graph above is for HSV-2.)</span></p> \n<h3>\n<span>4. </span>The CDC doesn't recommend testing for herpes</h3> \n<p>The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's guidelines say it loud and clear (""CDC does not recommend screening for HSV-1 or HSV-2 in the general population""). <br><span></span></p> \n<p><span>For the majority of people with herpes, the infection causes them no physical problems, and there's nothing they could do to cure themselves if they found out that they had it. So a positive diagnosis is of limited utility. The CDC's </span><a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/std/herpes/screening.htm"">reasoning</a><span>? </span><span>''It is not clear whether knowledge of a herpes diagnosis improves the health of people taking the tests and reduces spread of HSV in the population.""</span></p> \n<p><q class=""right"" aria-hidden=""true"">people with herpes but no symptoms can still spread the virus </q></p> \n<p><span>But some public heath professionals disagree with these recommendations. </span>It's important to note that people with herpes but no symptoms can still spread the virus to other people. And their risk of contracting HIV is two times as high as those who don't have herpes. (Herpes can help HIV sneak into the body even when there's no noticeable symptoms.)</p> \n<p>(Still scared? Here's how to <a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/std/herpes/stdfact-herpes.htm"">protect yourself</a> from getting herpes.)</p> \n<p><b>Update: </b>I added information about how the majority of Americans are infected with herpes viruses.</p>"

That means most doctors have an incentive to run up tests, treatments, and other services if they also want to run up their pay from Medicare.</p> \n<p>NerdWallet found male doctors seem to take greater advantage of this. They charge for about 5.7 services per patient, while women charge for 4.7 services. And the variation seems to apply from specialty to specialty.</p> \n<p>Male physicians also see 60 percent more patients. And since they're already paid more per patient, that translates to 88 percent more pay from Medicare reimbursements. In total, male physicians are paid $118,782 each year by Medicare and female physicians are paid $63,346.</p> \n<center> \n<p><img src=""http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/assets/4339641/Screen_Shot_2014-04-22_at_10.42.20_AM.png"" class=""photo"" alt=""Screen_shot_2014-04-22_at_10""></p> \n</center> \n<h3>Limitations of the analysis</h3> \n<p>NerdWallet lists four major issues that could limit their analysis.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""right"">Medicare is only one part, albeit a major one, of the health-care system</q></p> \n<p>For starters, Medicare payments vary across different places in the country.  It's possible female doctors could live in areas of the country where  pay happens to be lower.</p> \n<p>Medicare also pays differently for each type of service provided, and it might be the case that female doctors provide services that tend to be cheaper.</p> \n<p>It's also true the federal program typically pays less to doctors when procedures are done in a  hospital instead of a clinic. If female doctors are more likely to be  hospital-based, that could explain part of the pay gap.</p> \n<p>Finally, Medicare withheld data when less than 11 patients were treated by one  doctor for any given procedure. It's possible women fell more into this  low range than men.</p> \n<p>It's also important to remember that Medicare is only one part, albeit a major one, of the health-care system. That means doctors get income from other sources, such as Medicaid and private insurance. This analysis leaves out those two other sources of income for doctors, and it's possible the other sources of income shrink doctors' gender pay gap overall.</p>"
Donâ€™t read more health books. Read these 14 words.,http://www.vox.com/health-care/2014/4/22/5640636/dont-read-more-health-books-read-these-14-words,Donâ€™t read more health books. Read these 14 words from the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.,"<p>Thomas Frieden has a scary job. As director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, he gets the call when infections begin defeating all known antibiotics, or Ebola resurfaces, or overdoses from prescription opiates begin skyrocketing.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, I'm the kind of person who won't even go see movies about disease outbreaks. So when I sat down with Frieden recently, I asked him the question hypochondriacs need to know: What has all this data taught him to fear? What does he tell his family to do differently?</p> \n<p>His answer was borderline dull:</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>Very little is different really. It's basic. Wash your hands regularly. Get regular physical activity. Eat foods you love that are healthy. That's one of the things that's so challenging. Take physical activity as an example. You don't have to have much, 30 minutes a day. Doing that, which can be three 10-minute walks, is going to make a huge difference in your life. You'll feel better even if you don't lose an ounce. You will be much less likely to have high blood pressure, high cholesterol, cancer, arthritis, depression. You'll sleep better. And it doesn't cost a cent.</p> \n<p>There's a lot a of things that can be done that are not very difficult and can make a really big difference. Of course, get your shots, get vaccination, get a flu shot every year and see the doctor regularly and if you have a problem make sure to get follow up.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>The broader point — which came up again and again  in our interview — is that the main threats to health aren't spectacular.

And that leaves states with a bigger chunk of the bill to cover – one reason some states have hesitated to expand the public program.</p> \n<p>CBO is saying in its new report that, from everything its seen so far, the woodwork effect isn't as strong as it had initially been thought.

Obamacare will let Americans retire earlier,http://www.vox.com/2014/4/24/5643392/obamacare-might-let-people-retire-earlier,A new study finds retiree health plans â€” and Obamacare â€” could encourage people to retire earlier.,"<p>If people can get health insurance without a job, they're <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2014/02/05/yes-obamacare-will-probably-downsize-the-workforce-economists-explain-why/"">likelier </a>to stop working. And that means <a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/obamacare/"">Obamacare</a> might encourage people to retire earlier, according to <a href=""http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167629614000447#"">a new study</a>.</p> \n<p>Stanford University and American Enterprise Institute researchers found public employees are between 26 and 38 percent, depending on age, more likely to retire earlier if retiree health plans are available. By extrapolating those findings to the health-care law, researchers concluded that more Americans might move to reduce their workload — by not working or moving to part-time — before they turn 65, when Medicare becomes available regardless of employment.</p> \n<h3>The idea: Some people stay at work for health insurance</h3> \n<p><q class=""right"" aria-hidden=""true"">Supporters of universal health care see job lock as a really big downside to the US system</q></p> \n<p>Some people continue working later in life, particularly into their 50s and so forth, because a full-time job normally comes with health insurance. This is called job lock, and supporters of universal health care see it as a really big downside to the US system of employer-provided health insurance.</p> \n<p>Some employers, particularly in the public sector, offer retiree health plans that let employees retire before 65 while keeping some sort of health insurance. Researchers, by combing through various data sources, wanted to see whether these retiree health plans give employees an incentive to retire earlier and how many employees take advantage of the opportunity.</p> \n<h3>The finding: People retire earlier, or move onto part-time work, if health insurance remains available</h3> \n<p>Researchers found that those between the ages of 55 and 59, after controlling for various socioeconomic variables, are more likely to switch to part-time work or quit working entirely if retiree health plans are available.</p> \n<p><img alt=""Screen_shot_2014-04-23_at_11.10.32_am"" class=""photo"" src=""http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/assets/4344861/Screen_Shot_2014-04-23_at_11.10.32_AM.png""></p> \n<p>And there were similar differences for those aged 60-64.</p> \n<p><img alt=""Screen_shot_2014-04-23_at_11.17.14_am"" class=""photo"" src=""http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/assets/4344933/Screen_Shot_2014-04-23_at_11.17.14_AM.png""></p> \n<h3>What does all of this have to do with Obamacare?</h3> \n<p><q class=""right"" aria-hidden=""true"">Obamacare takes steps to break the link between employment and health insurance</q></p> \n<p>Like retiree health plans, Obamacare offers <a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/obamacare/what-is-a-health-insurance-subsidy#E5407383"">health insurance options </a>outside full-time employment. So like retiree health plans, Obamacare might incentivize some people to leave full-time work early.</p> \n<p>There's some precedent for this idea. The Congressional Budget Office in a previous report <a href=""http://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/attachments/45010-Outlook2014_Feb.pdf"">projected</a> Obamacare will reduce total hours worked in the US by 1.5 to 2 percent between 2017 and 2024.</p> \n<p>Obamacare has the potential to reshape the public sector's retiree benefits, since people can now shop for more options on the exchanges. Some cities and states are now exploring whether they can move retirees to Obamacare's marketplaces — and older workers might not move into the public sector as frequently as they do now, if they know they can get similar health benefits elsewhere.</p> \n<h3>Limitations of the study</h3> \n<p>The study doesn't look directly at Obamacare. It instead extrapolates its findings for retiree health plans to the health-care law. It's possible, however, that Obamacare might not lead people to retire earlier: perhaps Americans won't find the health plans available through Obamacare affordable enough.</p> \n<p><q class=""right"" aria-hidden=""true"">The study doesn't Look Directly at Obamacare</q></p> \n<p>There's also the issue of correlation versus causation. It's possible that people who are likelier to retire earlier are also likelier to go to public jobs with generous retiree health plans. If that's the case, then retiree health plans might not be leading to more early retirees; it could just be that jobs with retiree health plans attract people who are predisposed to retiring earlier. The study attempts to control for some of this, but the study's authors admit there's no way to fully control for this concern.</p> \n<p>The study also doesn't account for differences in retiree health plans. Some plans have higher costs for the insured, while others are far more generous and provide more coverage. It's unclear, based on this study, how less generous retiree plans impact employees' early retirements. But researchers conclude their findings still apply in the big picture.</p>"
"Obamacare's state exchanges, in six charts",http://www.vox.com/2014/4/25/5644876/five-takeaways-from-obamacares-state-based-exchanges,What we know about Obamacare's state exchanges so far.,"<p>States are just starting to get their first in-depth look at who is signing up for Obamacare.</p> \n<p>They're seeing that Medicaid is really popular, huge variation in the amount of young adults signing up, and that people aren't actually gravitating towards the very cheapest plans.</p> \n<p>The state exchanges have generally been more successful than <a href=""http://HealthCare.gov"">HealthCare.gov</a>, functioning more smoothly and enrolling a larger percent of those eligible. So here's what they're starting to find about who did, and didn't, sign up for Obamacare.</p> \n<h3>1) Medicaid is really popular</h3> \n<p>The states that moved to establish their own exchanges, with the exception of Idaho, also took on the <a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/obamacare/is-obamacare-available-in-all-states"">Obamacare-funded Medicaid expansion</a>. It should come as little surprise, then, that Medicaid made up a significant chunk of enrollments in these states. Even in Washington and Kentucky, which had functional websites from the start, Medicaid made up around four in five signups.</p> \n<p>Note that some states are left out of this report due to a lack of reliable data. But the trend is pretty clear: Medicaid is popular.</p> \n<center> \n<p><img src=""http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/assets/4347531/Screen_Shot_2014-04-23_at_6.20.43_PM.png"" class=""photo"" alt=""Screen_shot_2014-04-23_at_6.20.43_pm""></p> \n</center> \n<h3>2) There's huge variation in how many young people are signing up<br>\n</h3> \n<p>Young adults (people between 18 and 34) were a closely watched demographic this year. Younger people tend to have lower health-care costs, which can hold down premiums for everyone else.</p> \n<p>Nationally, 28 percent of people signing up were between 18 and 34, which falls short of the 39 percent goal the White House had set earlier this year. Between states, there was pretty huge variation in how well they did in young adult enrollment.</p> \n<center> \n<p><img alt=""Screen_shot_2014-04-25_at_12.56.47_pm"" class=""photo"" src=""http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/assets/4357581/Screen_Shot_2014-04-25_at_12.56.47_PM.png""></p> \n</center> \n<p>A caveat: Arkansas's exchange, which is in the chart for comparative purposes, is run by the federal government, while the listed state exchanges are run by the corresponding state. The Arkansas number also accounts for people who signed up for the federal exchange both through conventional means and the Medicaid private option.</p> \n<h3>3) States can take pretty aggressive steps to increase young adult enrollment</h3> \n<p>Arkansas, which refused to manage its own exchange, might provide a lesson for enrolling young adults. Arkansas expanded its Medicaid program through a private option: the state is using expansion dollars to sign up low-income residents for private insurance plans.</p> \n<p>So far, the private option is pushing up the amount of young adults in the private insurance pool. Without the private option, Arkansas's private insurance pool only includes 25 percent young adults. With the private option, that percent goes up to nearly 39. So if other states adopted the private option model, it's possible they could boost their young-adult enrollees.</p> \n<center> \n<p><img alt=""Screen_shot_2014-04-25_at_1.16.27_pm"" class=""photo"" src=""http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/assets/4357661/Screen_Shot_2014-04-25_at_1.16.27_PM.png""></p> \n</center> \n<h3>4) A majority of enrollees used tax credits<br>\n</h3> \n<p>Outreach groups like Enroll America say the biggest hurdle to getting people to sign up for Obamacare is the perception that health insurance is really expensive. So once people are told they probably qualify for <a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/obamacare/what-is-a-health-insurance-subsidy"">tax credits</a> under the health-care law, they're much more likely to sign up.</p> \n<p>And, as it turns out, most of people signing up on state exchanges really do qualify for tax credits — at least in the states that reported tax credit numbers so far.</p> \n<center> \n<p><img src=""http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/assets/4353055/Screen_Shot_2014-04-24_at_4.26.44_PM.png"" class=""photo"" alt=""Screen_shot_2014-04-24_at_4.26.44_pm""></p> \n</center> \n<h3>5) Enrollees love silver plans, not gold and platinum plans<br>\n</h3> \n<p>Obamacare offers five plan options on its marketplaces: minimum coverage, bronze, silver, gold, and platinum. Minimum coverage is, obviously, the minimum in terms of price and coverage. Platinum covers the most at the highest cost.</p> \n<p>It turns out people like the silver and bronze options the most, based on a few states' results.</p> \n<center> \n<p><img src=""http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/assets/4353153/Screen_Shot_2014-04-24_at_4.46.03_PM.png"" class=""photo"" alt=""Screen_shot_2014-04-24_at_4.46.03_pm""></p> \n</center> \n<h3>6) Enrollment remains open in some state exchanges<br>\n</h3> \n<p>Enrollment in the federal marketplace is officially closed, but, <a href=""http://thehill.com/blogs/healthwatch/health-reform-implementation/203910-obamacare-enrollment-still-growing-in-several"">as The Hill reported</a>, exchanges in at least eight states and the District of Columbia are still open for enrollment.</p> \n<p>Nevadans have until May 30 to sign up for health insurance, and those in the District of Columbia and Oregon have until April 30. The remaining states are deciding special enrollment eligibility on a case-by-case basis, and Connecticut and Rhode Island still don't have enrollment deadlines for people who faced technical issues.</p> \n<p>That means there's a very good chance enrollment in Obamacare's marketplaces will likely surpass <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/4/17/5625206/obamacare-final-enrollment-numbers"">the 8 million</a> the White House reported earlier this month — even though it's already ahead of projections.</p> \n<center> \n<p><img src=""http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/assets/4336477/Screen_Shot_2014-04-21_at_6.02.10_PM.png"" class=""photo"" alt=""Screen_shot_2014-04-21_at_6.02.10_pm""></p> \n</center> \n<p><b>Update</b>: For clarity, this post was updated with Arkansas's full exchange data.</p>"
A healthy economy means more sick workers,http://www.vox.com/2014/4/26/5652958/a-healthy-economy-means-more-sick-workers,"If the economy is good and more people are employed, more people take sick days â€” and infectious diseases might explain why.","<p>If the economy is good and more people are employed, more people take sick days.</p> \n<p>Economists have known about this trend for a while, and they typically provide two main reasons why. First, workers have an increased incentive to show up to work during a bad economy to avoid losing their jobs and falling into a bad job market. Second, a good economy's workforce might be less healthy since less healthy people can more easily find work during good times.</p> \n<p>Now, <a href=""http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/enhanced/doi/10.1002/hec.3054"">a new study</a> poses another explanation: better economies increase workloads. Those increased workloads encourage workers to go to work even when they're sick, and those sick employees then get their coworkers sick. Swiss economist Stefan Pichler developed a model to prove this idea, and his findings suggest that employers should encourage workers to stay home when they're sick.</p> \n<h3>The findings<br>\n</h3> \n<p><q class=""right"" aria-hidden=""true"">The number of sick days caused by infectious diseases goes up during good times</q></p> \n<p>To prove his explanation, Pichler's model looks at German health data and compares sick days caused by infectious versus noninfectious diseases. In theory, if the increase in sick days is caused by employees getting their coworkers sick during good economic times, then the cases of infectious diseases, instead of noninfectious diseases, should correlate with the rise.</p> \n<p>Pichler's idea holds up: the number of sick days caused by infectious diseases goes up during good times, while the amount of sick days due to noninfectious diseases appears to have no relation to the state of the economy.</p> \n<p>The finding is bad news during a good economy. It means people are more likely to get an infectious disease from their coworkers when everyone should be taking advantage of a better economy. It also indicates employers will have more sick and absent employees when workloads are expanding.</p> \n<h3>Limitations of the study</h3> \n<p><q class=""right"" aria-hidden=""true"">these limitations don't negate Pichler's findings, but they are important caveats</q></p> \n<p>Pichler's model looks at Germany's company-based insurance schemes, which, as he notes, tend to be healthier and younger than the overall population. That makes it unclear how these results can be generalized to a broader, older population.</p> \n<p>Pichler also acknowledges that his model and analysis don't fully address whether the workforce is less healthy during good economic times. It's still possible, then, that people with major health problems and those prone to sickness are more likely to find work during good times, and the overall sicker workforce could account for why the population seems to spread more infectious diseases and claim more sick days.</p> \n<p>Now, these limitations don't negate Pichler's findings. But they are important caveats to keep in mind when analyzing his results.</p> \n<h3>Policy implications</h3> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""right"">employers and governments should do more to encourage workers to take off work when they're clearly sick</q></p> \n<p>The most obvious implication of the study: employers and governments should encourage employees to take off work when they're sick. That would obviously benefit the public by enabling a healthier population.</p> \n<p>But there are other implications, too. As health economist Austin Frakt <a href=""http://theincidentaleconomist.com/wordpress/economic-booms-and-infectious-disease/"">points out</a>, this study provides yet another explanation as to why <a href=""http://qje.oxfordjournals.org/content/115/2/617.abstract"">public health generally improves during recessions</a> and, perhaps as a result, <a href=""http://theincidentaleconomist.com/wordpress/simplifying-health-care-spending-growth/"">health-care spending falls during bad times</a>.</p> \n<p>In other words, keeping workers home when they're sick isn't just a matter of ensuring American workers are healthier. It's also about helping ensure health-care costs remain pushed down even after the economy recovers from the recession.</p>"

We're importing salt water from Norway,http://www.vox.com/2014/4/28/5653696/were-importing-salt-water-from-norway,America can't produce enough saline to serve patients. So we've started importing from abroad.,"<p><span>Saline is one of the most basic and common items used in modern medicine. It's an incredibly simple solution that has two ingredients: water and salt.</span></p> \n<p>This makes it all the more baffling that, since the start of this year, America's doctors have been fighting an<a href=""https://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=1865006""> infuriating IV saline shortage</a>.</p> \n<p>Cancer centers, which often administer saline administering other IV therapies, are keeping strict inventories of how many bags they have on site. Things got so bad that, in late March, the Obama administration began importing additional saline from Norway. We are literally flying salt water thousands of miles across an ocean, because we can't make enough in the United States. Here's why.</p> \n<h3><span>1) Drug shortages are a big problem, especially for injectable generics like saline</span></h3> \n<p>Drug shortages have become increasingly problematic in recent years, rising steadily from 2005 through 2011, although dropping off in 2012.</p> \n<p><img alt=""Drug_shortages_by_year"" class=""photo"" src=""http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/assets/4358653/drug_shortages_by_year.png""></p> \n<p><span>About </span><a href=""http://2005%0961%202006%0956%202007%0990%202008%09110%202009%09157%202010%09178%202011%09251%202012%09117"">four out of every five </a><span>drug shortages are among generic versions of drugs that get injected, a 2011 report found. </span></p> \n<h3><span>2) There's only a handful of American companies making saline</span></h3> \n<p><span>The drugs most likely to have shortages are also those with the fewest manufacturers. About half of the injectable drugs facing shortages are made by two or fewer companies. </span></p> \n<p><span>This is true for saline, which only a handful of American companies currently manufacturer, largely Baxter and Hospira. This means that, if one company has a hiccup on its manufacturing process (like when Baxter had to recall some of its saline last fall) can ripple quickly throughout the medical system. </span></p> \n<p>When the FDA looked at why drugs like saline were running short, they found that a lack of capacity to produce more was the biggest cause.</p> \n<p><img alt=""Reason_for_shortages"" class=""photo"" src=""http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/assets/4359237/reason_for_shortages.png""></p> \n<p>""The production schedules are so tight and so tightly forecasted, they can't easily manufacture more,"" Fox says.</p> \n<h3>3) Saline isn't an especially high profit industry</h3> \n<p><span>Which explains why, even in the midst of a shortage, you don't see tons of enterprising businessmen rushing to build saline factories.</span></p> \n<p>""What normally should happen when there's demand, there's a market to be made and manufacturers come in,"" says Ted Okon, executive director of the Community Oncology Alliance. ""But you'd have to run your production lines like crazy to make any kind of a margin on these products. And that's when quality programs crop up.""</p> \n<h3><span>4) Manufacturers must produce saline in a sterile environment</span></h3> \n<p>Another challenge specific to saline: it has to be manufactured in a sterile environment, so it can — eventually — be safely injected into a patient's veins. In that way, saline can actually be more difficult to manufacture than pills.</p> \n<h3>5) Saline is difficult to ship</h3> \n<p>The Food and Drug Administration<a href=""http://www.fda.gov/drugs/drugsafety/ucm382255.htm""> announced </a>on March 28 it would begin importing additional saline from Norway ""while it is needed to address this critical shortage that directly impacts patients."" But even this isn't a great solution: saline is typically stored in one liter bags, which are bulky and expensive to transport internationally.</p> \n<p>""The thing that's hard with saline is that a typical bag is one liter, about the size of a loaf of bread. They're big and heavy, and that's one of the problems,"" Fox says. ""You can't get very much on the plane. That's why the majority of these injectables are manufactured in the United States even when you hear a lot about drug companies outsourcing to other countries.""</p>"

The Republican replacement for Obamacare is Fauxbamacare,http://www.vox.com/2014/4/29/5663554/fauxbamacare-obamacare-replacement,Scott Brown explained his Obamacare replacement. Surprise! It's Obamacare.,"<p>Scott Brown, who's now running for Senate in New Hampshire, has found the perfect position on <a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/obamacare/"">Obamacare</a>. He's for it. He's just not for calling it Obamacare.</p> \n<p>In an interview with <a href=""http://www.wmur.com/politics/closeup/CloseUP-Interview-with-Scott-Brown/25658422?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=twitter&amp;utm_campaign=wmur9"">WMUR</a>, he called Obamacare a ""disaster."" Then he was asked what he's for  — and he went on to describe Obamacare.</p> \n<p>""I've always felt that people should either get some type of health care options, or pay for it with a nice competitive fee,"" he said. ""That's all great. I believe it in my heart. In terms of preexisting conditions, catastrophic coverages, covering kids, whatever we want to do."" He even said it could ""include the Medicaid expansion [for] folks who need that care and coverage.""</p> \n<p>Oh, he also promises his plan won't raise taxes, cut spending on Medicare, or make people drive very far to go to the hospital. <span>So his plan will have more generous insurance options and no way to pay for them. In other words, his plan will be like Obamacare, but even better! Call it Fauxbamacare.</span></p> \n<p>Brown is picking up on a real opportunity here. The polls around Obamacare are frustrating both to the law's principled supporters and its principled opponents. There is, in theory at least, a huge opening for an unprincipled opponent — someone who opposes ""Obamacare"", but supports virtually all of the policies in Obamacare.</p> \n<p>Someone who supports Fauxbamacare.</p> \n<p>In September 2013, <a href=""http://www.cnbc.com/id/101064954"">CNBC</a> found that 46 percent of the public said they were opposed to ""Obamacare,"" but only 36 percent of the public said they were opposed to ""the Affordable Care Act."" In other words, the name Obamacare boosted opposition by 10 percentage points.</p> \n<p>The disconnect runs deeper. The Kaiser Family Foundation has <a href=""http://kff.org/health-reform/poll-finding/march-2013-tracking-poll/"">found</a> that the component parts of Obamacare poll highly even as the law itself remains unpopular. They also found that Obamacare's most popular provisions were its least well-known, and vice versa:</p> \n<p><img alt=""Kaiser_poll_provisions"" class=""photo"" src=""http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/assets/4376051/Kaiser_poll_provisions.png""></p> \n<p>Meanwhile, repeal remains an unpopular position. A Kaiser Family Foundation poll released this morning <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/4/29/5661696/despite-the-facts-america-has-convinced-itself-obamacare-is-a-disaster"">found</a> that though only 38 percent of Americans approve of Obamacare, 58 percent want to see their member of Congress work to improve Obamacare. Only 38 percent want their member of Congress to repeal the law. (Much more on that poll <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/4/29/5661696/despite-the-facts-america-has-convinced-itself-obamacare-is-a-disaster"">here</a>.)</p> \n<p>That, if anything, understates the danger of promising repeal. Before Obamacare launched, repeal was a politically reasonable position. You can take away something people don't yet have. But now that well over 10 million people depend on Obamacare for their insurance repeal would be a disaster for the GOP. It would mean canceling more insurance policies than Obamacare ever dreamed of.</p> \n<p>Of course, the GOP's position has never been repeal. It's always been repeal-and-replace. The problem is they've never quite come up with a replacement. There's a good reason for that. Obamacare borrows quite a bit from conservative health-care policy thinking. It's modeled off Mitt Romney's reforms in Massachusetts, which were in turn modeled off the reforms Senate Republicans put forward in 1993.</p> \n<p>Republicans could have seen Obamacare as a victory. Instead, the party underwent a we-have-always-been-at-war-with-Eastasia process and turned against ideas they'd once seen as uncontroversial (Sen. Chuck Grassley, June 2009: ""I believe that there is a bipartisan consensus to have individual mandates.""). The problem with turning against all those ideas is that it's actually really difficult to come up with workable health-reform plans that aren't also terrible politics. Obamacare is a good example of just how hard it is: it's a plan so politically appealing that both Republicans and Democrats have turned to it, and yet it's still terrible politics!</p> \n<p>But the polls are clear. The American people don't want Obamacare. However, they like what's in Obamacare. And they don't like it when Republicans try to get rid of Obamacare. Brown's position shows Republicans a way out: <span>a rebranding of Obamacare, accompanied, perhaps, by some vague tweaks and changes to be named later. Fauxbamacare, in other words. </span></p>"

""But no one had really looked at the question of what happens afterwards.""</p> \n<p>That's what Scales' <a href=""http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/00396060"">new research</a>, published Monday in the journal <i>Surgery, </i>did. Scales looked at a data set of 93,000 people who had had kidney stones removed or fragmented. He found that 14 percent had an unplanned trip back to the doctor within a month of their kidney stone procedure, where they either turned up at the emergency room or hospital admission.</p> \n<p>What surprised Scales the most wasn't necessarily the rate of unplanned care, but how much those unexpected visits cost. The average cost of an unplanned follow-up visit is just about $30,000 – and sometimes upwards of $45,000.</p> \n<p>One of the lingering questions from the study is how many of these unplanned visits are preventable – whether people are turning up at the emergency room because of mistake by their doctor, or if kidney stone removal is just that difficult to perform without these types of follow-up visits.</p> \n<p>Scales, for his part, thinks a good number might be preventable. He points to the fact that people seen at really high volume facilities – places that do lots of kidney stone removals – tend to have 20 percent fewer unplanned follow-up visits than people seen at places that do fewer procedures. <span>That suggests having some kind of expertise in the procedure can lead to better outcomes. </span></p>"

In the 17 states his company is involved in, he expects premium changes to range from very low single-digit increases to some double-digit hikes.

""That's a good thing for families and was a goal of the Affordable Care Act.""</p> \n<p>Health care prices, meanwhile, grew slowly in the first quarter of 2014. They rose by 0.5 percent – about one-third of the rate of overall economic growth. This essentially means that people can buy more health care for their dollar now than they could last year.</p> \n<p>""There's no doubt prices are higher than many people would like, but the news in today's release is that they're growing more slowly,"" Furman says.

Americans believe two things about Obamacare enrollment that canâ€™t both be true,http://www.vox.com/2014/5/1/5669238/belief-echoes-and-Obamacare,Here's why Americans believe two things about Obamacare enrollment that canâ€™t both be true.,"<p><span>The most recent </span><a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/4/29/5661696/despite-the-facts-america-has-convinced-itself-obamacare-is-a-disaster"">Kaiser Family Foundation tracking poll</a><span> had some good news and some bad news for </span><a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/obamacare/what-is-obamacare"">Obamacare</a><span>. The good news was that a plurality of Americans know the law signed up 8 million people. The bad news is that a majority of Americans nevertheless think the law fell way short of expectations on enrollment.</span></p> \n<p>That's...weird. <span>It would make sense if the public didn't know the law signed up 8 million people and so they thought it had fallen short on enrollment. But k</span><span>nowing that the law signed up 8 million people is pretty much the same as knowing that it beat enrollment expectations. The response is roughly akin to people knowing that Barack Obama won the electoral college in 2012 but believing he lost the election.</span></p> \n<p>The finding makes more sense, however, if you've read Emily Thorson's <span>""</span><a href=""http://repository.upenn.edu/dissertations/AAI3564225/"">Belief Echoes: The Persistent Effects of Successfully Corrected Misinformation</a><span>"".</span></p> \n<p><span>In the paper, Thorson, an associate professor at George Washington University's School of Media and Public Affairs, runs an experiment where she splits people into three groups. The first group is given an article neutrally profiling (fake) congressional candidate John McKenna. This was the control group.</span></p> \n<p><span> The second group got the same article, but now it said that McKenna was under fire for ""s</span><span>everal substantial donations from convicted felon Daniel Elsio, who formerly headed up the largest organized crime syndicate in Kansas."" The third group got that article, too, but then they were given another article with this this (hilarious) correction:</span></p> \n<blockquote> \n<p><span>Correction: Regarding the candidates' biographies, an article published in the Kansas City Star last week stated that Daniel Elsio, a felon convicted of drug trafficking and murder, was a frequent donor to John McKenna's campaign and attended several [Republican/Democratic] party fundraisers. However, further investigation of the campaign donation records has shown that the donor listed was actually Daniel Elio, the owner of a local car dealership.</span></p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Whoops.</p> \n<p>Afterwards, Thorson used a 10-point scale to compare feelings towards McKenna among the three groups. Unsurprisingly, the people who read the article with no mention of donations from a drug trafficker/murderer liked McKenna the most and the people who still thought McKenna took donations from a crime lord liked him the least. The surprise was the people who thought McKenna took donations from a crime lord and then read — and believed — the correction: they remained much more negative towards McKenna than the control group. The new information didn't fully, or even mostly, reverse the effects of the bad information.</p> \n<p><img src=""http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/assets/4386077/belief_echoes.jpg"" class=""photo"" alt=""Belief_echoes""></p> \n<p>""Exposure to negative information about a candidate creates what I call belief echoes,"" Thorson writes, ""effects on attitudes that persist even after the information is shown to be false.""</p> \n<p>Obamacare has a belief echoes problem.</p> \n<p>For months, the press was wall-to-wall with coverage of Obamacare's catastrophic launch. People knew that Obamacare was a disaster that no one was able to sign up for. Then, unexpectedly, the March surge was so overwhelming that enrollment beat expectations. That got wall-to-wall coverage too, and so a lot of people actually know that Obamacare signed up 8 million people. But the impressions formed by the early coverage persist. People think the law missed its enrollment targets even as they've actually absorbed the data showing the law beat its enrollment targets.</p> \n<p>All that said, though the media used it as a benchmark, success or failure for Obamacare was never going to be defined by whether the law signed up 6 million people or 8 million people in its first year. The mix of healthy and sick applicants (which gets shorthanded as young and old applicants) always mattered more. It now looks like the law signed up somewhat fewer young people than the administration hoped but more than enough to keep premiums stable in most markets, which is what matters for its long-term prospects. The hitch is that story will <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/4/18/5621786/outside-washington-obamacare-doesnt-exist"">vary a lot</a> from state to state, and some states may be wild successes whereas others don't have nearly enough young, health applicants to keep premiums down.</p>"

The individual market had lots of flux before Obamacare – and will have lots of flux after it.</h3> \n<p>Most people don't purchase their own health insurance for very long; individual plans are more typically used as a bridge between other sources of coverage, usually employer-sponsored insurance.</p> \n<p>One <a href=""http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/early/2014/04/14/hlthaff.2014.0005.full"">recent study</a> in the journal <i>Health Affairs </i>found that, prior to Obamacare, only two-thirds of those in the individual market kept their policy for more than four months.

""We're forced to rely on anecdotal reports from insurers or a study from Energy and Commerce.

Is 8 million people signing up for private insurance a success? That's hard to say.</h3> \n<p><b> </b>The number is higher than the 7 million people the Congressional Budget Office projected would use the exchange. The number could fall slightly below that target depending on how many people pay their premium: if Ignagni's estimate of<a href=""http://healthjournalism.org/blog/2014/05/looking-ahead-to-new-aca-enrollment-numbers/""> 85 percent</a>of customers paying holds true, for example, that would work out to 6.8 sign-ups.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""left"">there are 20 million people who could have purchased Obamacare and didn't</q></p> \n<p>You could see the 8 million as a proof-of-concept: there was a sizable audience of people who decided they wanted what Obamacare was selling. This wasn't taken as a given at the start of open enrollment, or even as recently as December, when health law sign-ups lagged far behind projections.</p> \n<p>At the same time, there are lots of people without insurance who didn't sign up. Kaiser Family Foundation estimates 28 million people were eligible to buy coverage on the exchanges (this includes the uninsured, and those already buying coverage in the individual market).</p> \n<p>About a quarter of them decided to. That still leaves another 20 million people who didn't purchase insurance – maybe because they didn't want to, or were confused, or never even heard there were options to begin with.</p> \n<p>""CBO has enrollment ramping up next year to 13 million and that feels like a pretty big leap given how hard it was to hit 8 million,"" says Levitt.</p> \n<p>The people who signed up in 2014 were likely the most motivated, the low hanging fruit for enrollment workers. The people who will be pitched in 2015 sat out the first round of sign-ups and, come next year, could be a tougher sell.</p> \n<h3>Live Q&amp;A until 1 p.m.</h3> \n<p><i>Do you have question about Obamacare enrollment I didn't answer?

Here's how Obamacare is doing in your state,http://www.vox.com/2014/5/2/5673890/heres-how-obamacare-is-doing-in-your-state, ,"<p><a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/obamacare/"">Obamacare</a> is a story of 50 states. It doesn't really matter how the entire nation does in terms of enrollment; success or failure instead comes down to how each state's <a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/obamacare/what-is-a-health-insurance-exchange"">exchange</a> fares.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""right"">the success of the exchanges varied significantly from state to state</q></p> \n<p>Looking at the health-care law through that framework, however, is a lot more nuanced: the success of the exchanges varied significantly from state to state, according to the Urban Instute's <a href=""http://www.urban.org/publications/413112.html"">analysis</a> of new federal data.</p> \n<p>Take, for example, budget forecasters' enrollment projections. The nation, overall, beat enrollment projections by more than 15 percent. But some states (Vermont, Florida, and California) completely surpassed their projected enrollment numbers, while others (South Dakota, Hawaii, and Massachusetts) completely missed their projections.</p> \n<center> \n<p><img src=""http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/assets/4393005/obamacare_enrollment_projection_reach.png"" class=""photo"" alt=""Obamacare_enrollment_projection_reach""></p> \n</center> \n<p>It's a similar story for Obamacare's target populations: individual market shoppers and uninsured people who don't qualify for employer-based insurance or public health plans. The nation, overall, reached about a quarter of this population. But Massachusetts reached only 8 percent, while Vermont netted 73.5 percent.</p> \n<center> \n<p><img src=""http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/assets/4392925/obamacare_target_population_reached.png"" class=""photo"" alt=""Obamacare_target_population_reached""></p> \n</center> \n<p>So what can federal and state governments learn from these numbers? In general, it seems state-based exchanges, which were run by state governments, fared a lot better than the federal exchanges, which were run by the federal government after states refused to pick up the task.</p> \n<center> \n<p><img src=""http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/assets/4393053/federal_versus_state-run_exchanges.png"" class=""photo"" alt=""Federal_versus_state-run_exchanges""></p> \n</center> \n<p>That, however, also comes with a big caveat: some states seriously botched their own exchanges, so state-run exchanges didn't guarantee success. Oregon in particular <a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/obamacare/how-did-oregon-get-obamacare-so-wrong"">now plans</a> to move to a federal exchange after the state struggled to get its website functioning throughout the entire open-enrollment period.</p> \n<p>The numbers also don't tell us the health of the new signups and how many people have actually paid their first premiums, which is the final step to obtaining insurance. Both those factors are important: healthier insurance pools can keep health-care spending and premiums down, and signups obviously don't matter if they don't translate to purchased insurance policies. (It's worth noting major insurers have <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/5/1/5668448/insurers-sound-pretty-happy-about-obamacare"">told us</a> that they're so far satisfied with both the age breakdown, an important indicator of health, and the amount of people paying for premiums.)</p> \n<p>Still, the numbers show it generally helps to have a state government fully behind the task of insuring as many people as possible through Obamacare. That could be an important lesson as states head into the 2015 open-enrollment period in November.</p>"

And that's actually a pretty significant public health problem.</p> \n<h3>Most Americans don't have dental insurance</h3> \n<p>Health and Human Services estimated that <a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/databriefs/db40.pdf"">127 million</a> people with employer-sponsored coverage have dental insurance as well. That leaves about 180 million people who don't have oral health coverage. Medicare doesn't cover dentist visits for seniors. Medicaid coverage of dental benefits varies by state, with <a href=""http://www.nashp.org/sites/default/files/Adult%20Dental%20Monitor.pdf"">16 states</a> providing comprehensive coverage to adults.</p> \n<h3>Yes, going to the dentist is actually important</h3> \n<p>Cosmetic reasons aside, there are lots of legitimate reasons to visit the dentist. The mouth, for one, is a weirdly good indicator of overall health. Inflamed gums, for example, can be an <a href=""http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-living/adult-health/in-depth/dental/art-20047475?pg=2"">early warning sign </a>of a number of significant diseases, including HIV, diabetes and cardiovascular disease.</p> \n<p>Gum disease, left unchecked, can lead to bigger health problems.

The progress is largely thanks to better education, greater awareness of risky practices during pregnancy, and medical and technological advancements in the past couple decades. These helped reduce common causes of maternal deaths, including botched abortions, infections, high blood pressure, and hemorrhaging.</p> \n<p><q class=""right"" aria-hidden=""true"">Another problem is many Americans might not be able to afford or access the health care they need</q></p> \n<p>The US, however, showed significant signs of worsening: the rate of deaths per 100,000 livebirths went from 12.4 in 1990 to 18.5 in 2013.</p> \n<p>It's not completely clear why, but Nick Kassebaum, a University of Washington researcher involved in the study, says there are a few possibilities.</p> \n<p>For one, the United States has higher rates of obesity and heart disease, which make pregnancy riskier.</p> \n<p>Another problem, Kassebaum says, is many Americans might not be able to afford or access the health care they need — a result of living in a country where <a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/health-care-spending/how-does-american-health-care-spending-compare-to-other-countries"">care is more expensive</a> and <a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/obamacare/will-obamacare-cover-all-of-the-uninsured"">tens of millions don't have health insurance</a>. Since complications during pregnancy and childbirth can require extensive follow-up, lack of access to care can be life-threatening in some instances.</p> \n<p>It's also true that the US, in general, is getting better at reporting maternal deaths, which may be driving the rate up just because more cases are being reported. But Kassebaum cautions that the reporting improvements aren't enough to account for most of the rise in maternal deaths, and other developed countries reduced their maternal death rates despite also improving their reporting capabilities.</p> \n<p>Perhaps as important as what's causing the deaths is what's not: Kassebaum says that his analysis saw maternal deaths increase at every age group, so it's not older mothers, who are more likely to die during childbirth, driving America's increase.</p> \n<h3>How can we improve?</h3> \n<p><q class=""right"" aria-hidden=""true"">federal and state governments should take steps to better understand the problem and its causes</q>Even in the countries that improved, there's still a lot of progress to be made. Latin America, Africa, and south Asia in particular still have maternal mortality rates in the hundreds and even thousands.<b> </b>In many of these countries, simply increasing access to skilled and trained doctors, modern facilities, and improved sanitation could go a long way.</p> \n<p>In the US, Kassebaum says federal and state governments should take steps to better understand the problem and its causes. He cites the UK's <a href=""http://www.ncepod.org.uk/"">Confidential Inquiry program</a>, which identifies and investigates maternal deaths to guide improvements in the British health-care system.</p> \n<p>Increasing access to health care in the US would also help, Kassebaum explains.

For one, the Massachusetts research followed a larger cohort for four years; the Oregon experiment looked at a smaller group of people for 18 months.</p> \n<p>""The Oregon study had 10,000 people for 18 months,"" Sommer says. ""We had 270,000 people who gained coverage for four years afterwards. We have records of who gained health insurance, and every death recorded in the state.""</p> \n<p>The Oregon study focused on a specific set of health care measures, certain indicators that would indicate the likelihood of developing diabetes or heart disease. On those metrics, it didn't find any difference between people who had gained health insurance coverage through a lottery and those who had lost out.</p> \n<p>But it's possible there are other things going on outside of those metrics. It doesn't capture, for example, ""infections or whether someone already had a heart attack,"" Sommers says.</p> \n<p>Unlike the Oregon study, this Massachusetts research is not randomized. People weren't assigned blindly into groups of people who gained insurance coverage and who didn't (that only happened in Oregon because the state held a lottery to let people into a limited-size expansion).</p> \n<p>Instead, the Massachusetts study took counties elsewhere in the United States that looked a lot like the states' counties — they had similar levels of diversity, poverty, gender balance, age and other factors — and looked at what happened there in comparison to Massachusetts.</p> \n<p>And what happened in Massachusetts was, simply, fewer people were dying.</p> \n<h3>Is it worth covering 830 people to save one life?</h3> \n<p>The new Harvard study estimates that for every 830 people the Massachusetts insurance expansion covered, one additional life was saved. This was a 2.9 percent decrease in the mortality rate compared to similar counties that did not have insurance expansions.</p> \n<p>Is that worth the  extra <a href=""http://www.masstaxpayers.org/sites/masstaxpayers.org/files/Health%20Reform%20Report.pdf"">$91 million</a> that Massachusetts spends annually to continue its insurance expansion? That's a question for policy makers to grapple with.</p> \n<p>""You might have state leaders who say, this is too expensive, or who have other priorities,"" says Sommers. ""That's not really a thing we're putting a judgement on here.""</p> \n<p>It's hard to know whether the health care law will lead to similar gains elsewhere. Massachusetts has<a href=""https://www.aamc.org/download/263512/data/statedata2011.pdf""> more doctors per capita</a> than any other state, which could mean it was easier for people to see a doctor once they gained insurance coverage.</p> \n<p>But there's also the possibility of even bigger gains outside of Massachusetts, where states are starting from a lower insured rate than the Bay State did in 2006. If the coverage expansion effects more people outside of Massachusetts, that could mean even more deaths prevented elsewhere.</p>"
Some actually good news on federal health care spending,http://www.vox.com/2014/5/6/5687312/some-actually-good-news-on-federal-health-care-spending,The federal government thinks it will spend $900 billion less on health care programs than it did just three years ago.,"<p><span>The federal government thinks it will spend </span><a href=""http://crfb.org/blogs/900-billion-slowdown-federal-health-care-spending"">$900 billion less</a><span> on health care programs over the next decade than it projected just three years ago, according to a new analysis from the Committee for a Responsible Fiscal Budget. </span></p> \n<p>Most of that isn't due to the federal government cutting programs or reducing what it pays doctors. Its largely due to the fact that health care costs have grown a lot slower in the past four years than they did in the past.</p> \n<p><img alt=""Download"" class=""photo"" src=""http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/assets/4414729/download.png""></p> \n<p>The federal government runs the two largest health insurance plans in the country, Medicare and Medicaid (the latter program it shares with state government). It added a third item to its insurance portfolio this fall, when the health insurance marketplaces launched.</p> \n<p>Collectively, those three programs cover more than a third of all Americans. And that means any change to health care spending, however tiny, can have a huge impact on the federal budget.</p> \n<p>The CFRB analysis of Congressional Budget Office<a href=""http://cbo.gov/publication/45229""> data</a> suggests that about 80 percent in the expected reduction in health spending is due to the fact that health care costs grew really slowly for the past four years. Instead of outpacing overall economic growth, as they typically do, medical spending grew at pretty much the same rate as everything else.</p> \n<p>The other 20 percent reduction comes from specific policy changes that happened in Washington. When the Supreme Court ruled that states didn't have to participate in the health care law's Medicaid expansion, for example, that cut the amount that budget forecasters expect the federal government to spend on the public program.</p> \n<p>But by and large, most of the spending reduction comes from the fact that health care costs have grown slower than expected — a huge boon for a country that also happens to be a massive health insurer.</p>"

The health care law might be to thank.,"<p>Hospitals are meant to save lives — but they can often be deadly places to spend time.</p> \n<p>From the infections patients get when they stay in the hospital (which kill about <a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/hai/"">75,000 people </a>annually) to medical mistakes (surgeons left an impressive<a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2012/12/20/surgeons-left-4857-objects-in-patients-over-the-past-two-decades/""> 4,857 items</a> in patients over the last two decades), hospitals are places where lots can go wrong.</p> \n<p>But hospitals are, just slightly, starting to get better at getting things right. A new federal report shows that improvements in hospital care have saved 15,000 lives in 2011 and 2012. How did this happen?</p> \n<h3>Readmissions are falling</h3> \n<p><span>Spending money on hospital readmissions is arguably one of the worst uses of health care dollars. Readmissions happen when something gets screwed up during an initial procedure.</span></p> \n<p>They aren't popular with patients (who have to spend unnecessary time in the hospital) or insurers (who have to pay for additional medical care). But there's some good news on readmissions in a new federal report: after five years of holding steady, hospital readmissions in the United States appear to be falling.</p> \n<p><img alt=""Readmission_rates"" class=""photo"" src=""http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/assets/4416961/readmission_rates.png""></p> \n<p>The new figures, published Wednesday by Health and Human Services, show that readmission rates — which held steady at 19 percent from 2007 to 2011 — fell to 18.5 percent in 2012 and 17.5 percent in 2013.</p> \n<p>Those percentages can seem small but they add up: the 1.5-percentage-point decrease in readmissions accounts for 150,000 fewer patients readmitted to a hospital when they didn't need to be.</p> \n<p>The drop in readmissions has coincided with the start of a new Obamacare program that penalizes hospitals that have the highest readmission rates. Hospitals can now lose as much as 2.5 percent of their Medicare revenue if they have lots of patients turning up in the hospital again. One analysis showed that hospitals have lost<a href=""http://www.kaiserhealthnews.org/stories/2013/august/02/readmission-penalties-medicare-hospitals-year-two.aspx""> $227 million</a> in fines because of this program.</p> \n<h3>Hospitals are screwing up less</h3> \n<p>The federal government says it's seen a drop-off in a number of hospital-acquired conditions that can be deadly, like a patient fall or pneumonia acquired from a ventilator.</p> \n<p><img src=""http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/assets/4418809/hospital_aquicred_conditions.png"" class=""photo"" alt=""Hospital_aquicred_conditions""></p> \n<p>Overall, Health and Human Services shows that the number of hospital-acquired conditions has fallen by 9 percent over the past three years. In 2010, there were 145 problems acquired in the hospital per 1,000 patients discharged. In 2012, that rate stands at 132.</p> \n<p><span>This decline has also coincided with health law programs that try to penalize these exact types of events. The health care law's value-based purchasing program, for example, penalizes hospitals if they don't hit certain quality metrics — and, alternatively, rewards hospitals if they do really great. These are also the type of events that can lead to readmissions, meaning that the health care law's readmission penalties could have also played a role. </span></p>"

He says he settled on the idea when he was thinking through the different goals he wanted to achieve — slower health care cost growth, better quality care — all seemed most attainable when the government was the one paying everybody's health care costs.</p> \n<p>""I began to list the policies I wanted to pursue, and then I came to the payment side...and I started to talk to <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/4/9/5557696/forget-obamacare-vermont-wants-to-bring-single-payer-to-america"">the people who helped shape Vermont,</a> looked at Vermont, and I just said, 'oh my, there is just one straight shot here, it's going to single-payer,'"" Berwick said in an interview Wednesday.</p> \n<p>""At that point it was more about thinking about putting it on the table. Now it is the entire table.""</p> \n<h3>Does single-payer help patients?</h3> \n<p>Berwick was fairly convinced by Vermont's research suggesting that moving to a single-payer system would help reduce costs, because the state would have more power to negotiate lower prices. In our interview, we got to talk a little bit about what a single-payer system would mean for patients: would single-payer stifle innovation, if you didn't have different insurers competing against each other?</p> \n<p>This is a particularly important issue for Massachusetts, which is home to huge powerhouses of academic medicine like Massachusetts General and Harvard Brigham-Women's hospitals.</p> \n<p>Berwick's view is that a single-payer system would actually be better equipped to handle new innovations in medicine. As the only payer in the game, the government could more easily demand changes from providers who weren't up to snuff.</p> \n<p>""A single payer system can become a really powerful  force for enhancing competition among providers,"" Berwick argues. ""One reason is that you're doing metrics that are standardized, so you can see what's actually happening. Right now, you can't compare Cigna's beneficiaries to United's.""</p> \n<p>Berwick cited one example from running Medicare, which is essentially a single-payer system for Americans over 65. When he received <a href=""https://oig.hhs.gov/testimony/docs/2011/levinson_testimony_11302011.pdf"">a report</a> that over 300,000 beneficiaries were being treated ""atypically"" with anti-psychotic drugs. Nursing homes seemed to be using drugs typically meant to treat psychiatric conditions to keep patients chemically restrained.</p> \n<p>So Berwick called in the leaders of various nursing home groups to Washington and demanded changes in their practices. Speaking on behalf of more than 50 million beneficiaries, he says, gave him more clout.</p> \n<p>""I could go to the mat and act protectively,"" Berwick says. ""I was able to tell them, either you fix this, or I will. I don't think there's a single private insurer who would have done that.""</p> \n<p>Berwick's view is that there can be good management and bad management — both in a single-payer system, and in a private health insurance plan.</p> \n<p>""Bad management is bad management,"" he says. ""We have to understand, in either situation, how to keep consumers in focus.""</p>"

Eliminating that policy, <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/09/24/heres-why-obama-wont-delay-the-individual-mandate/"">experts say</a>, would probably lead to millions fewer people buying health insurance coverage — largely the millions of people who don't buy plans right now.</p> \n<p>One big reason that Urban Institute doesn't expect insurance coverage to plummet if the employer mandate disappeared is that the vast majority of employers already offered insurance before there was any requirement to do so. They've done so for a couple of reasons, one large one being that companies don't have to pay taxes on health insurance. This makes it a much cheaper way to provide compensation to workers than salary.</p> \n<p><span>""The alternative would be giving </span><span>individuals a higher salary, which would </span><span>be taxable income, and those workers </span><span>would then have to purchase coverage in </span><span>the individual market,"" Urban's report concludes. </span></p> \n<p>Since Obamacare started, there have been a few high-profile cases of companies shifting some people to the exchanges, most notably Trader Joe's with part-time workers and UPS with spouses. There hasn't been any major company yet to shift their full-time workers into the marketplaces rather than provide a health plan.</p> \n<p>That could happen in 2015, when the employer mandate kicks in. But the lengthy history of employer-sponsored insurance will likely make most large companies hesitant to drop coverage quickly.</p> \n<p>While Urban's Institute suggest that a future without an employer mandate wouldn't be very different, actually taking that policy out of the law is a big lift. The mandate was delayed because the White House said it proved too complicated to implement during Obamacare's first year. But eliminating it outright would likely require Congress passing — and Obama signing — a law that took the requirement off the books. And that, given Congress' current track record on working together on Obamacare, isn't likely to happen any time soon.</p>"

""We may think we know the answer, but we don’t.""</p> \n<p><span>Weil highlighted the fact that Medicaid providers have invested resources in meeting the needs of their patient population that commercial insurers have traditionally neglected, including an emphasis on culturally competent care, efforts to make care geographically accessible, and facilitating linkages to social services. </span></p> \n<h3><span> Michigan hopes to control costs by encouraging healthy behaviors and smart spending. </span></h3> \n<p><span>Michigan isn’t moving their Medicaid population into exchange plans like Arkansas. But it is taking cues from the private sector to encourage healthy behaviors.</span></p> \n<p>The state's Republican governor, Rick Snyder, announced his support for the Medicaid expansion in early 2013, but he had to work with a reluctant conservative legislature to authorize expansion. Snyder signed the expansion into law last September, and the state received waiver approval from the federal government in late December.</p> \n<p><span>The first step in Michigan's effort to encourage healthy behavior is having enrollees complete an annual health risk assessment, a survey used to identify health risks and potential areas for improvement, like smoking and obesity; this is patterned on a similar questionnaire administered by Blue Care Network of Michigan. </span></p> \n<p>The state may use other incentives for healthy behavior in the future; those are still being finalized. Enrollees who complete the assessment and comply with healthy behavior standards will be rewarded with smaller co-pays.</p> \n<p><span> The state also taps into an idea popular with conservatives to encourage prudent health spending: Michigan is creating health savings accounts that beneficiaries can draw on for co-pays. Enrollees</span><span> between 100 and 138 percent of the federal poverty line will be expected to pay two percent of income into the account. The state will also make contributions.</span></p> \n<p><span>Most beneficiaries will be expected to pay co-pays after six months of enrollment, though these co-pays will not exceed five percent of income.

Six reasons Obamacare premiums are going up next year,http://www.vox.com/2014/5/14/5713890/six-reasons-obamacare-premiums-are-going-up-next-year,"Insurance premiums went up every year before Obamacare. They're likely to go up afterwards, too.","<p>Summer is upon us. For most Americans, this means bathing suits and beaches. For America's health wonks, hot weather signals something completely different: it's the start of health insurance rate filing season.</p> \n<p>Health insurance plans are just now starting to turn in the prices they want to set for coverage next year. These filings are the first glimpse at how expensive Obamacare will be in 2015.</p> \n<p>They're not easy to read, either: insurance rate filings tend to be dozens of pages long, filled with charts and jargon. No individual filing tells the entire story of how much premiums will increase in 2015. But there are a few things worth keeping in mind about what, taken altogether, the coming deluge of premium rates can tell us about the price of health insurance.</p> \n<h3>1. Insurance premiums went up every year before Obamacare. They're likely to go up afterwards, too.</h3> \n<p>Every year since the government began tracking these sorts of things, the cost of medical care has increased. Some years<a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/4/15/5612900/health-spending-growth-fast/in/5433049""> it increases slowly</a>; some years it increases faster. But its a pretty constant truth that the grand total of health care spending always goes up.</p> \n<p>This means that premiums, which insurance companies use to cover subscribers' medical bills, is near certain to increase — just as they would have if the Affordable Care Act had never become law.</p> \n<p>""You've got things related to medical cost growth that have nothing to do with the health care law,"" says Caroline Pearson, vice president at research company Avalere Health. ""Independent of any other factors, insurers may have a 5 to 6 percent increase in medical trend they need to account for.""</p> \n<h3>2. Some rates will go up a little. Some will go up a lot. A handful might go down.</h3> \n<p>""There's a lot of variability by state and by plan,"" Pearson continues. ""Some plans overpriced and some underpriced. Just because a single-carrier is increasing or decreasing a rate doesn't tell you a lot, except that they may have missed the boat last year.""</p> \n<p>The recently-released rates from Washington are a good example. There, the proposed rate changes range from a 6.8 percent decrease to a 14.2 percent increase.</p> \n<p><img alt=""Screen_shot_2014-05-12_at_10.59.53_am"" class=""photo"" src=""http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/assets/4440925/Screen_Shot_2014-05-12_at_10.59.53_AM.png""></p> \n<p>Molina, the company with the 6.8 percent decrease, had set its premiums <a href=""http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304081804579558331236178714?mg=reno64-wsj&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fonline.wsj.com%2Farticle%2FSB10001424052702304081804579558331236178714.html"">much higher</a> than its competitors.

""But where you'll see more movement is in the band of prices shrinking, and premiums getting closer.""</p> \n<h3>3. Every state will be different</h3> \n<p>There's huge variation in what percent of the eligible market each state exchange reached. States that have reached a higher proportion of those who could shop on the marketplace are likely to have healthier populations. More people, the thinking goes, means the exchange netted not just the really sick people who need insurance but also some people who won't use their health insurance plans as much.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""left"">what happens in massachusetts could be way different than alabama</q></p> \n<p>States have made different policy decisions that could also effect insurance rates. Some, for example, have allowed plans that don't comply with Obamacare to stay in the individual market. This could keep some healthier people out of the exchange, and insurers might need to change their rates to reflect that change.</p> \n<p>""The people who were less healthy would be more likely to gravitate towards the compliant-coverage because its more robust,"" says Cori Ucello, senior health fellow at the American Academy of Actuaries. ""Plans knew ahead of time, when setting their rates, which states were allowing these transitional policies, so they could build that into their prices.""</p> \n<p>Last, even before Obamacare, there was huge variation among states — and some of the factors driving that are still in play.</p> \n<p><img src=""http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/assets/4451083/premiums.png"" class=""photo"" alt=""Premiums""></p> \n<p>Massachusetts tends to have higher prices because many academic hospitals in Boston are able to command really high prices. Alabama providers earn less, and premiums are cheaper there.</p> \n<h3><span>4. What matters the most: who insurers expected to sign up in 2014</span></h3> \n<p>There's a lot of chatter in health policy circles about exchange sign-ups falling short of the Obama administration's target for young adults. The White House has previously said it hoped for about 39 percent of sign-ups to be between 18 and 35, but the number only ended up at 28 percent.</p> \n<p>What matters more than what the White House wanted is what insurance companies expected. If insurers have been less optimistic this whole time — and expected young adults to be less than a third of enrollment — than they wouldn't need to jack up premiums to account for their mistake. But if their estimates were off — they expected more or less young adults — than they might change their rates to reflect the difference.</p> \n<p>""Even if a plan has a high average age, if the insurer expected that, it doesn't mean there will be a big increase in the rates,"" says Cori Ucello, a senior fellow at the American Academy of Actuaries.</p> \n<h3><span>5. The rates for 2015 involve a lot of guesswork </span></h3> \n<p>Insurers don't fully know who signed up for their health insurance plans. Yes they know their subscribers' names, where they live and how old they are. But they don't quite know yet who has expensive health conditions — or who might not use a single doctor visit in the entire next year.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""right"">'we still don't have a very good idea of who is enrolled'</q></p> \n<p><span>That's because the open enrollment period just ended in mid-April. </span><span>The people who signed up for coverage in April didn't even start their plans until May 1, less than two weeks ago.</span></p> \n<p><span>""We still don't have a very good idea of who is enrolled,"" says Elaine Corrough, a fellow at the Society of Actuaries who consults with health plans on setting premiums. ""Insurers are able to take into account maybe two or three months of experience.""</span></p> \n<p>Insurers do know how old their new enrollees are, which can they can use as a bit of proxy for how healthy people are. But age isn't a perfect predictor: its possible to have a 29-year-old with really high costs, or a 50-year-old who barely spends a dime. Right now, insurers don't know which patients will be really expensive. They just haven't had enough time to figure it out.</p> \n<h3>6. These are only opening bids</h3> \n<p>What insurers are turning in right now are their proposed rate increases. These are an opening volley in negotiations between health plans and regulators that will happen over the next few months.</p> \n<p>Over the course of those negotiations, prices can change dramatically. In Iowa, for example, Pearson notes that the average proposed increase started at 17 percent. But the average increase <i>allowed</i> was only 7 percent.</p> \n<p>""They know they're going to get push back,"" says Pearson. ""In some states, the rates come down a lot between the initial and final proposed increase.""</p>"

What the hell is happening at the VA?,http://www.vox.com/2014/5/14/5714574/what-the-hell-is-happening-at-the-va,The US Department of Veteran Affairs is under fire after at least 40 veterans allegedly died as a result of poor policies.,"<p><b>Update</b>: This article is a preliminary explainer. For a more in-depth version, check out our card stack <a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/va-scandal-explained/"">here</a>.</p> \n<p>Flawed policies at the US Department of Veteran Affairs might be hurting — and in some cases killing — American veterans.</p> \n<p>The ongoing crisis began after allegations surfaced that poor scheduling practices in a Phoenix, Arizona, VA hospital might have led to the deaths of more than 40 veterans. The issue has drawn national attention, pulling in congressional leaders, veterans' advocates, and even the Obama administration.</p> \n<p>But how did this happen, and what kind of change could it lead to? Here's a primer on the VA and the ongoing controversy.</p> \n<h3>What is the VA?</h3> \n<p>The VA is short for the US Department of Veteran Affairs, an agency that offers numerous services to military veterans. Its health-care wing, the <a href=""http://www.va.gov/health/aboutvha.asp"">Veterans Health Administration</a> (VHA), is the largest health-care system in the country, with more than 53,000 independent licensed health-care practitioners and 8.3 million veterans served each year.</p> \n<p>The VA plays a major role in veterans' lives after they leave the military. The health care provided by the VA in particular can help veterans reassimilate into civilian life by treating conditions, such as physical and psychological injuries from war, that would otherwise hinder their ability to look for and find a job.</p> \n<h3>Why is the VA in trouble?</h3> \n<center> \n<p><img alt=""488810855"" class=""photo"" src=""http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/assets/4450363/488810855.jpg""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">The Phoenix VA hospital. Christian Petersen / Getty Images News</p> \n</center> \n<p>The controversy began after the Arizona Republic <a href=""http://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/2014/04/10/deaths-phoenix-va-hospital-may-tied-delayed-care/7537521/"">reported</a> in April that 40 or more US veterans died while waiting for appointments at the Phoenix VA hospital. According to internal emails later acquired by <a href=""http://www.cnn.com/2014/04/23/health/veterans-dying-health-care-delays/"">CNN</a>, VA managers in Phoenix created a secret wait list in an attempt to hide that 1,400 to 1,600 sick veterans were forced to wait months to see a doctor. Even worse, top-level management supposedly knew of and defended the practice.</p> \n<p>Besides the secret list, the Phoenix VA hospital already provided a different, official wait list to DC that allowed VA higher-ups to verify that patients are being treated in a timely manner (within 14 to 30 days). But Phoenix's secret wait list supposedly avoided federal oversight with an elaborate scheme in which officials shredded evidence that some patients were taking months to be seen. What's worse, if someone died while waiting for an appointment due to the secret wait list, Phoenix officials would allegedly discard the name as if the fatal error never happened.</p> \n<h3>Does the VA have a history with these kinds of issues?</h3> \n<p>The allegations against the Phoenix facility led lawmakers and veterans' advocates to raise further questions about the VA system, which has a long history of inconsistent wait times and accessibility issues. Since as far back as 2000, the US Government Accountability Office (GAO) has <a href=""http://www.gao.gov/products/HEHS-00-90"">called on</a><b> </b>the VA to fix a complicated system that's caused veterans to get sicker or even die while waiting for an appointment with a doctor.</p> \n<p><q class=""right"" aria-hidden=""true"">""Certainly, the way the system is set up, if someone wanted to go in and manipulate it, it would not be hard to do""</q></p> \n<p>Debra Draper, health-care director at the GAO, cites several major problems with the way the VA currently operates.</p> \n<p>First, the VA's scheduling policies are very ambiguous, which can result in confusion and poor interpretation of guidelines at the local level. Second, the VA's technology systems are severely outdated; the scheduling system, for example, is now more than 25 years old. Third, training, particularly for schedulers, is inadequate and loosely enforced. Lastly, the VA maintains little-to-no oversight over local health-care systems, particularly when it comes to issues with access and waiting periods.</p> \n<p>As one example, Draper points to the complicated way the VA schedules appointments. As she explains it, the system allows both the patient and physician to choose a desired date, and schedulers have little training or guidance on which date to pick for an appointment. Not only is the process unnecessarily complicated, but there's little oversight at higher levels of the administrative ladder to make sure the correct option is picked.</p> \n<p>""Certainly, the way the system is set up, if someone wanted to go in  and manipulate it, it would not be hard to do,"" Draper says. ""But in  some facilities, they just don't really understand what they're supposed  to do, and sometimes they do things incorrectly. It really gets back to  the ambiguity in the policies and processes, and on top of that the  lack of oversight.""</p> \n<p>The oversight is so bad, Draper explains, that the VA could easily fail to identify, much less fix, issues like those alleged at the Phoenix facility.</p> \n<h3>Is there proof these issues are widespread?</h3> \n<center> \n<p><img src=""http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/assets/4451599/131281314.jpg"" class=""photo"" alt=""131281314""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">A doctor helps a homeless veteran. John Moore / Getty Images News</p> \n</center> \n<p>Given the concerns with the overall VA system, veteran advocates and some lawmakers, including <a href=""http://tbo.com/list/military-news/sen-rubio-asks-va-for-florida-wait-list-data-20140513/"">Marco Rubio</a>, are now moving to investigate other VA systems around the country.</p> \n<p>While the allegations against the Phoenix offices are the worst so far, the American Legion has tracked issues with scheduling practices in <a href=""http://www.legion.org/documents/legion/pdf/va_epidemic.pdf"">up to 18 states</a>. Some of the most recent findings, for example, led VA officials to put two employees in North Carolina on administrative leave because of inappropriate scheduling conflicts, <a href=""http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/12/us/va-scandal-durham-north-carolina/"">CNN reported</a>.</p> \n<h3>Is inadequate funding part of the problem?</h3> \n<p>Some people think so. A whistleblower <a href=""http://washingtonexaminer.com/whistleblower-veterans-affairs-denied-delayed-tests-to-cut-costs/article/2548327"">recently told</a> the Washington Examiner, for example, that cost-cutting measures at a Texas facility in particular led to delays in care that resulted in worsening problems and even deaths.</p> \n<p>At least on the technology side, it's clear more funding could help. With the scheduling system now more than 25 years old, more money could fund necessary upgrades.</p> \n<p>Draper, however, says the VA could fix a lot of its problems by simply clarifying policies and restructuring how administrators enforce those policies. That would provide the oversight and guidance necessary to prevent the kind of shoddy practices alleged at the Phoenix VA hospital.</p> \n<h3>Why hasn't anything been done before?</h3> \n<center> \n<p><img alt=""161607202"" class=""photo"" src=""http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/assets/4450387/161607202.jpg""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">President Barack Obama addresses Congress. Chip Somodevilla / Getty Images News</p> \n</center> \n<p>Given that the GAO has been warning about the VA's system since 2000 and released reports detailing problems as recently as <a href=""http://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-13-130"">2013</a> and <a href=""http://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-14-509T"">2014</a>, the question for many advocates and watchdogs is how the issue has persisted for so long.</p> \n<p><q class=""right"" aria-hidden=""true"">""I don't know if the VA even knows what's going on at the local level""</q></p> \n<p>Draper says issues with the VA system just haven't gotten enough attention from lawmakers or the public before. As with many political issues, it often takes a crisis for lawmakers or the public to start paying attention — and the current controversy at Phoenix could be that crisis.</p> \n<p>With the VA lacking proper oversight and processes for handling these sorts of cases, it also seems unlikely that VA officials would have stepped in if it were not for the recent controversy.</p> \n<p>""When you have an environment with weak oversight, I don't know if the  VA even knows what's going on at the local level,"" Draper says.</p> \n<h3>What action is being taken?</h3> \n<center> \n<p><img alt=""84279379"" class=""photo"" src=""http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/assets/4450395/84279379.jpg""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">VA Secretary Eric Shinseki in front of Congress. Brendan Hoffman / Getty Images News</p> \n</center> \n<p>The VA, in response to the crisis, <a href=""http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/08/politics/va-shinseki/index.html"">promised</a> a face-to-face audit at all its clinics, and VA Secretary Eric Shinseki <a href=""http://www.va.gov/opa/pressrel/pressrelease.cfm?id=2541"">placed</a> three Phoenix VA hospital officials on administrative leave as it conducts an investigation into the hospital's alleged misdeeds. The Obama administration is also <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/as-outrage-over-va-allegatons-grows-obama-and-aides-scramble-to-respond/2014/05/19/2b01ed3c-df71-11e3-810f-764fe508b82d_story.html"">sending</a> a top aide to oversee investigations.</p> \n<p>In response to the GAO's reports and recommendations, the VA has also been implementing some new initiatives and pilot programs to reduce travel and wait times for veterans. But the implementation of improvements has so far taken years, with little progress to show for it.</p> \n<p>Draper argues the VA should do more and quickly. She says the department should establish clearer regulations and more oversight. Those solutions, she says, wouldn't necessarily require more funding to the VA; they could be done by restructuring and realigning current systems.</p> \n<p>Technology upgrades would also help, given the age of some of the VA's systems. But those would likely require more funding — an unlikely measure, given Congress's <a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/congressional-dysfunction/what-is-congressional-dysfunction"">dysfunctional nature</a>.</p>"
Another red state just caved on Obamacare,http://www.vox.com/2014/5/15/5716350/indianas-expanding-medicaid-thats-a-big-deal,"350,000 Hoosiers are about to gain access to affordable coverage, but Governor Pence doesn't want to call it a Medicaid expansion.","<p>Despite vocal opposition to Obamacare, Governor Mike Pence of Indiana just joined the ranks of conservative state officials willing to compromise with the federal government to expand health coverage for their states' poorest residents. Here's the short version:</p> \n<ol> \n<li><span>Indiana isn't using traditional Medicaid. Instead they're trying to expand an alternative health program called Healthy Indiana.</span></li> \n<li><span>Healthy Indiana relies more on conservative health-care ideas, like using deductibles and co-pays to make individuals more careful shoppers for health care.</span></li> \n<li><span>Healthy Indiana will have to get a bit more generous to comply with Obamacare's Medicaid expansion. But it'll still require more cost-sharing from beneficiaries than traditional Medicaid.</span></li> \n<li><span>Indiana still needs to get approval for this plan from the Obama administration. Pence says he expects to formally submit the request for a waiver in June.</span></li> \n</ol>  \n<hr> \n<h3><span>So, is Indiana signing up for Obamacare's Medicaid expansion?</span></h3> \n<p><span>Yep, but don't expect the governor to frame it that way.</span><span> </span><span>""From the very beginning of my tenure as governor, we've been saying no to the Affordable Care Act in Indiana,"" Pence said at today's announcement. ""Medicaid is not a program we need to expand, it is a program we need to change.""</span></p> \n<p>Pence has proposed to expand an existing state program, the Healthy Indiana Plan, to extend affordable coverage to all Hoosiers below 138 percent of the federal poverty line. Indiana would pay for that expansion using Obamacare's Medicaid expansion funds.</p> \n<p><b></b>Healthy Indiana is popular with its beneficiaries, but the program would have to change to become Obamacare-compliant. Right now, for example, it imposes annual and lifetime dollar limits, doesn't cover maternity care, and requires monthly contributions from most enrollees. The Department of Health and Human Services <a href=""http://www.ibj.com/pence-sebelius-to-meet-on-health-care-expansion-proposals/PARAMS/article/45057"">made it clear</a> that some of these rules were unacceptable if Indiana wanted federal funds for a full Medicaid expansion.</p> \n<p><span></span><span>He's billing this move as an ""alternative"" to Medicaid expansion, because the state is seeking permission from the feds revamp the Healthy Indiana Plan. But </span><span>Indiana's special expansion still needs to play by Obamacare's rules.</span></p> \n<h3><span>What is the Healthy Indiana Plan?</span></h3> \n<p>In 2008, Indiana made an effort to expand health coverage for working-age adults who are historically left out of the state's Medicaid program. The federal government allowed Indiana to offer non-traditional coverage to adults below 200 percent of the federal poverty line, about $24,000 for an individual.<span> Called the Healthy Indiana Plan, the program relies on health policies popular with Republicans, including steep deductibles paired with savings accounts for health expenses. Some believe that deductibles make individuals more cost-conscious, so they're smarter about how they spend on medical care.</span></p> \n<p>Under the current program, Healthy Indiana beneficiaries make monthly contributions toward a savings account; these contributions range from $0 to $92 per month depending on income. The state supplements contributions for lower-income enrollees. Those savings are used to pay the $1,100 deductible on medical expenses.</p> \n<p><span>Healthy Indiana has some elements that Obamacare is supposed to eliminate, like spending and enrollment limits and limited benefits. </span><span>The Department of Health and Human Services gave Indiana an extension for the program through the end of 2014, but would not permit the state to use the current version of the program to expand Medicaid.</span></p> \n<h3><span>Why did Indiana decide to expand Medicaid now? </span></h3> \n<p>Indiana has a Republican governor and both legislative chambers are controlled by the GOP. State Senator Karen Tallian, a Democrat, introduced two pieces of legislation attempting to expand Medicaid earlier this year; <a href=""http://wfhb.org/news/medicaid-expansion-proposal-blocked/"">both were blocked</a>.</p> \n<p>But there's a growing body of evidence that Medicaid is a great deal for states. For 2014 through the end of 2016, the federal government will pick up the complete tab for Medicaid expansion, so when states delay expansion, they're leaving federal dollars on the table. A <a href=""http://www.cbpp.org/cms/index.cfm?fa=view&amp;id=4131"">recent analysis</a> from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities found that expansion only raises state Medicaid spending by 1.6% between 2015 and 2024 relative  to not expanding. Since Indiana residents have to make federal tax payments, they're still helping finance expansion in other states; they're just not seeing any benefit at home.</p> \n<p>And there's plenty of room for benefit: according to the <a href=""http://kff.org/health-reform/fact-sheet/state-profiles-uninsured-under-aca-indiana/"">Kaiser Family Foundation</a>, 801,000 Indiana residents are uninsured. Many would have access to coverage through the new marketplaces, but 23 percent would be too poor to qualify for tax credits. Without Medicaid expansion, these individuals wouldn't have access to affordable coverage.</p> \n<h3><span>What is the governor proposing to do?</span></h3> \n<p>The governor is tweaking the Healthy Indiana Plan to comply with Obamacare. In order to get the feds on board, the program will have to lose restrictions on how many people can enroll — and kill the annual and lifetime limits on medical care, too. HIP 2.0, as some are calling it, will also have to guarantee certain minimum benefits, including certain preventive services and maternity care without co-pays.</p> \n<p>Pence wants to create a two-tiered system. ""HIP Basic"" will be a plan that everyone below the federal poverty line is eligible for. It will require modest co-pays when a patient receives services, but it won't require a monthly premium. ""HIP Plus"" is a more generous — and more expensive — program that will be optional for those below poverty, but will be the default for people between 100 and 138 of the federal poverty level. HIP Plus will cover all of the same benefits as HIP Basic, plus some additional services like vision and dental. According to Pence, HIP Plus will require a monthly contribution of $3 to $25 depending on income.</p> \n<p>There's also a provision that will allow Medicaid to directly subsidize coverage offered by an employer for eligible individuals who can't afford that insurance. Not many people, however, are likely to fall into this category.</p> \n<p>""It’s not as if there are a ton of people making less than 100 percent of the federal poverty line who have good jobs with employer-based insurance that they have to turn down because they can’t afford it,"" says Aaron Carroll, director of the Center for Health Policy and Professionalism Research at Indiana University School of Medicine. ""I think that’s likely rare. I’m not seeing huge numbers of people taking him up on that.""</p> \n<h3><span>What are the benefits of a plan like this? </span></h3> \n<p>Some state Medicaid programs don't offer dental benefits to their adult enrollees; those are optional benefits under federal law. That means HIP Plus might be more generous than programs elsewhere.</p> \n<p>And this expansion plan is better for enrollees than no expansion at all. It charts a new way forward for Indiana's Medicaid program, and provides other Republican states with another expansion model that they may be willing to embrace.</p> \n<h3>What are some potential drawbacks?</h3> \n<p>There is <a href=""http://www.rand.org/news/press/2011/03/25.html"">evidence</a> that deductibles and co-pays reduce health spending, and that could help drive down the cost of Medicaid in Indiana — a potential plus of this approach. The theory is that, when there are costs associated with going to the doctor, patients will only turn up for visits when they really need them.</p> \n<p>But there's a possible drawback here too: people aren't really good at distinguishing between the care they need and what they don't. Expenses can result in individuals putting off important kinds of care like certain screenings and high-value prescription drugs. In this particular case, out-of-pocket costs will be modest for Medicaid beneficiaries, so this may not be a big problem.</p> \n<h3><span>What's next for Indiana? </span></h3> \n<p>Receiving permission from the federal government to reshape Medicaid is a process. <span>The state needs to make the case that their expansion plan will achieve the goals of Medicaid expansion and that it won't cost the federal government any more than a traditional expansion would.</span></p> \n<p>It takes time — usually a few months — to receive federal approval for a Medicaid waiver. Once the waiver application is drafted, there's a mandatory 30-day public comment period. The application is then submitted to the federal government for approval. Michigan's waiver was approved about two months after it was submitted; Governor Pence anticipates submitting the waiver in June.</p>"
Meet Obamacare's secret weapon in the war on exorbitant health-care costs,http://www.vox.com/2014/5/17/5717940/meet-obamacares-secret-weapon-in-the-war-on-exorbitant-health-care,Obamacare isn't all about its insurance exchanges.,"<p>Obamacare isn't only about its <a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/obamacare/what-is-a-health-insurance-exchange"">insurance exchanges</a>.</p> \n<p>There's actually another half to the health-care law: it reforms <a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/how-doctors-are-paid/how-are-us-doctors-paid-today"">payments to doctors</a>. And these reforms could play a big role in reshaping the US health-care system. They are, in short, what the Obama administration hopes will drive down the US's <a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/how-doctors-are-paid/bend-the-health-care-cost-curve"">high health-care spending</a> over time.</p> \n<p>Perhaps the biggest of those reforms is <a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/how-doctors-are-paid/what-are-accountable-care-organizations"">accountable care organizations</a> (ACOs). These organizations band doctors and hospitals together under a fixed budget and the potential for bonus payments to encourage them to find savings and improve health outcomes.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""right"">There's actually another half to the health-care law: it reforms payments to doctors</q></p> \n<p>The bad news is <a href=""http://innovation.cms.gov/Files/reports/PioneerACOEvalReport1.pdf"" target=""_blank"">federal</a> <a href=""http://www.hhs.gov/news/press/2014pres/01/20140130a.html"" target=""_blank"">reviews</a> so far show that only about a quarter of ACOs participating in federal programs have saved enough money to get payment bonuses through Medicare.</p> \n<p>MissionPoint Health Partners, however, seems to be one of the ACOs making the program work. The organization has partnered up with major health-care providers in recent years to establish ACOs for both private and public programs.</p> \n<p>Whatever MissionPoint is doing, the company claims it's working. The organization, for one, points to steady growth: it went from from 1,000 physicians and 15,000 members in 2012 to 1,600 providers and 90,000 members in 2014.</p> \n<p>The company also estimates it saved private, self-insured patients roughly 12 percent in health-care costs during the ACO's first year. (The company couldn't provide how much money it's saved through public programs like Medicare, since that information is embargoed.)</p> \n<p>So what does MissionPoint think it's doing right? I interviewed CEO Jason Dinger to find out, and he provided three broad lessons for other organizations trying to get into the ACO business.</p> \n<h3>1) Focus on the patient's home life<br>\n</h3> \n<p>Dinger attributes most of his organization's success to how it addresses issues outside the doctor's office.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""right"">""When we have fallen short, it's when just we've tried to educate someone as opposed to helping them solve for their problem""</q></p> \n<p>As a few examples of these issues, he points to patients' access to clinics and grocery stores, ability to cook certain foods, and whether someone uses a step stool to get on a bed. These issues can seem out of sight and mind for many doctors, but Dinger says they can play a much bigger role in a patient's long-term health than, say, a diagnosis or prescription.</p> \n<p>To help address these issues, one thing Dinger's organization promotes is home visits — something the company did not do prior to establishing an ACO. These not only let medical providers see problems at home firsthand, but they also let providers develop realistic solutions. That close attention, Dinger explains, helps much more than a simple education.</p> \n<p>""When we have fallen short, it's when we've tried to educate someone as opposed to helping them solve for their problem,"" he says.</p> \n<p>Other times it can be a matter of simply making life easier for patients. MissionPoint realized it was seeing lots of children with asthma in the emergency room. The organization figured out many patients were trying to administer their asthma medication without a plastic spacer, which was more expensive than the actual medication. So MissionPoint started paying for spacers, and emergency visits dropped as a result.</p> \n<h3>2) Set up the right tools and network</h3> \n<p>Building a technology system to track patient outcomes is expensive, which is why Dinger thinks it's important to have a large system in which the size of programs is scalable.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""right"">""it can be very hard to have a robust ACO solution for just a single, small population of patients""</q></p> \n<p>""You have to make that investment. Then the challenge of the ACO is growing its membership enough to offset those costs,"" Dinger says. ""But it can be very hard to have a robust ACO solution for just a single, small population of patients — and I think that's what some people are finding.""</p> \n<p>Building up a large population of patients is possible for a growing organization like MissionPoint, which serves thousands of members in six states.</p> \n<p>But it's much harder for scrappy startups and smaller clinics and hospitals with little-to-no reputation in the ACO business. That, Dinger speculates, might lead smaller institutions to merge and consolidate with industry giants — a trend that has already been <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/06/03/hospital-chains-keep-getting-bigger/"">going on for years</a> but could, in theory, be worsened by ACOs. That could reduce competition in the health-care market, which, <a href=""http://www.kaiserhealthnews.org/stories/2011/january/13/aco-accountable-care-organization-faq.aspx"">Kaiser Health News explained</a>, seriously worries some health economists.</p> \n<p><img alt=""Hospital_consolidations"" class=""photo"" src=""http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/assets/4459249/hospital_consolidations.png""></p> \n<h3>3) Don't be afraid to experiment</h3> \n<p>A large part of building an ACO is simply launching to see what works and what doesn't. Dinger guesses that figuring out what works is 90 percent on-the-job experience.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""right"">""getting started is the most important thing, and then consequently building a system that can handle multiple populations is second""</q></p> \n<p>""I think often we err on trying to design this really complex system without getting started. But getting started is the most important thing, and then consequently building a system that can handle multiple populations is second,"" Dinger says.</p> \n<p>The big point is that ACOs should not be afraid to be flexible and experiment. When MissionPoint has tried to just educate patients it didn't work nearly as well as more involved personal attention to individuals — that was a lesson learned and incorporated into the organization's best practices.</p> \n<p>""You're trying to build a to-do list that a health partner in our world can do when working with an individual patient,"" Dinger explains. ""The challenge is that over time you probably start with a list of 100 to-dos, but you realize that 25 are really effective.""</p> \n<p>Weaning down this kind of to-do list can be a constant challenge for providers in ACOs, because the 25 really effective treatments for one patient might be completely different for another patient. So this part of the process largely comes down to learning and adapting to different situations.</p> \n<p>This, in the end, might be the defining difference between successful ACOs and those that don't significantly reduce costs. Dinger says it's important for ACOs to look at all these problems — and the lessons that can be learned from them — as solvable. Otherwise, it's going to be really difficult to continue making progress.</p> \n<p>""There's lots of things in our business we could throw our hands up for,"" Dinger admits. ""But it's about making sure it works.""</p>"
We're living six years longer than we did in 1990,http://www.vox.com/2014/5/16/5722680/were-living-six-years-longer-than-we-did-in-1990,Most of the gains are seen in low-income countries.,"<p>People around the world are living a lot longer than ever before.</p> \n<p><a href=""http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2014/world-health-statistics-2014/en/"">A new report</a> from the World Health Organization (WHO) charts the improvements made just in the past couple decades, and the gains are huge. A baby girl born in 2012 can expect to live an average of 72.7 years, compared to a baby boy who can expect to live to 68.1 years. That's a six-year gain since 1990.</p> \n<h3>Low-income countries saw the largest life expectancy gains</h3> \n<p>The global average doesn't tell the whole story. Low-income countries, for example, made considerably larger gains than the rest of the world in the past two decades.</p> \n<center> \n<p><img src=""http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/assets/4461575/life_expectancy_gains.png"" class=""photo"" alt=""Life_expectancy_gains""></p> \n</center> \n<p>What's driving these improvements? WHO primarily credits huge drops in the infant mortality rate. Between 1990 and 2012, the under-five mortality rate dropped from 75 deaths per 1,000 live births to 48 per 1,000 — a significant 36 percent drop. Since these deaths come at such a young age, a high infant mortality rate can significantly push down the average life expectancy.</p> \n<h3>But low-income countries still have a long way to go<br>\n</h3> \n<p>While these gains are great, low-income countries are still mostly playing catch-up in the global health disparity.</p> \n<center> \n<p><img src=""http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/assets/4461599/life_expectancy_2012.png"" class=""photo"" alt=""Life_expectancy_2012""></p> \n</center> \n<p>So people in low-income countries are living much longer than they used to, but they still need to gain a full 15 to 19 years of life before they catch up with the most developed nations. That's one reason global aid efforts, like those to get <a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/vaccines/what-is-vaccine"">vaccines</a> to poorer countries, are widely seen as crucial: a lot of people in low-income countries are dying from health conditions that the wealthy world can easily treat and prevent.</p>"

The pill, manufactured by Gilead Sciences, is more popularly known as Truvada on the market.</p> \n<p>Specifically, the CDC asked doctors to consider Truvada for patients in relationships with an HIV-positive partner, gay and bisexual men who engage in risky sexual behaviors (such as multiple male partners or unprotected sex), heterosexual men and women with partners who also engage in risky behaviors, and anyone who uses injection drugs or shares needles.</p> \n<p>This is big news: the drug has been on the market for years, but the CDC's support could push more doctors to seriously consider the drug.</p> \n<h3>Truvada really does reduce the risk of HIV infections</h3> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""right"">Several studies found that consistently taking an HIV prevention pill can reduce the chance of infection by 90 percent or more</q><a href=""http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1011205""></a></p> \n<p><a href=""http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1011205"">Several</a> <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3770474/"">studies</a> found that consistently taking an HIV prevention pill can reduce the chance of infection by 90 percent or more. And that risk, the CDC notes, can be reduced further by using a condom and <a href=""http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-living/mens-health/in-depth/health-issues-for-gay-men/art-20047107?pg=1"">other prevention strategies</a>.</p> \n<p>The treatment, however, doesn't come cheap: it can cost <a href=""http://www.goodrx.com/truvada"">more than $15,000 a year</a>. But the pill is often covered by health plans, and Gilead <a href=""http://www.truvada.com/truvada-patient-assistance"">offers financial assistance</a> to those who don't have the proper coverage.</p> \n<p>The drug can also, in rare instances, cause some serious side effects, ranging from too much lactic acid in the blood to serious liver problems. As a result, the CDC recommends people prescribed to Truvada get consistent check-ups to make sure nothing is going unexpectedly wrong.</p> \n<p>Still, used correctly, the drug can play a significant role in preventing a disease that's still a constant fear for many people.</p> \n<h3>HIV infections are rising among young men</h3> \n<p><a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/nchhstp/newsroom/docs/CDC-MSM-508.pdf"">A recent CDC fact sheet</a> sounded the alarm on new HIV infections. For one, the disease is still very common among men who have sex with men: it's roughly 44 times more common among that population than other men.</p> \n<p>Among men who have sex with men, new HIV diagnoses rose by 12 percent between 2008 and 2010. What's worse, new HIV diagnoses rose even more prominently among the youngest category of men who have sex with men.</p> \n<center> \n<p><img alt=""Screen_shot_2014-05-16_at_3.28.00_pm"" class=""photo"" src=""http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/assets/4465119/Screen_Shot_2014-05-16_at_3.28.00_PM.png""></p> \n</center> \n<p>Even though black people make up roughly 13 percent of the population, they accounted for disproportionate sections of new HIV infections.</p> \n<center> \n<p><img alt=""2010_hiv_infections_groups"" class=""photo"" src=""http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/assets/4466213/2010_hiv_infections_groups.png""></p> \n</center> \n<p>The good news is that HIV isn't the death knell it used to be. Several treatments can now reduce an HIV-positive person's viral load to undetectable levels — to the point that the disease becomes nearly impossible to transmit, according to <a href=""http://www.aidsmap.com/No-one-with-an-undetectable-viral-load-gay-or-heterosexual-transmits-HIV-in-first-two-years-of-PARTNER-study/page/2832748/"">early evidence</a> from an ongoing study.</p> \n<p>Truvada and the other available treatments obviously don't eliminate the many risks of HIV, and HIV-positive people still need to get consistently checked to avoid any signs of their condition worsening. But it does make the disease considerably less infectious and deadly than it was during the terror-ridden 1980s and early 1990s. The CDC's decision could help reduce that terror even further.</p>"

In states that don't expand Medicaid, there's a coverage gap for the uninsured living below the poverty line (about $11,670 for an individual). They're too poor to qualify for insurance subsidies, and without expansion, they're likely stuck without affordable insurance options.</p> \n<p>This creates an incentive to <i>over</i>-report income in order to qualify for tax credits where Medicaid is not an option. Earlier regulatory guidance dealt with the problem of people <i>accidentally</i> overstating their income (maybe your hours got cut unexpectedly mid-year) and said the government would not try to recoup subsidies already paid under these circumstances. <span>Last week's regulation, by contrast, is about people intentionally lying. </span></p> \n<p><span>For that, there will be no special coverage gap exemption.</span></p> \n<p>According to the regulation, the $250,000 penalty is for ""knowingly and willfully"" providing false information. The more modest $25,000 fine can apply in cases where people provide incorrect information without malicious intent.

The administration can also offer a corrective action plan instead of a penalty, or settle on a compromise penalty amount.</p> \n<p>These regulations were just finalized, but the Obama administration did not design the penalties; they are spelled out in the <a href=""http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-111hr3590enr/pdf/BILLS-111hr3590enr.pdf#page=112"" style=""background-color: #ffffff;"">text</a> of the Affordable Care Act itself. <span>But will the federal government actually take advantage of their legal capacity to prosecute offenders?</span></p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""center"">""The money at stake in any given case is too small, and the penalties too cumbersome, to justify much in the way of government enforcement.""</q></p> \n<p>""<span>I would be surprised if the government decides to spend a lot of government resources on this,"" said Timothy Jost, a law professor at Washington and Lee University.

They homed in on UnitedHealthcare's decision not to sell any plans on healthcare.gov this year, deciding instead to only sell products on the state-marketplaces.</p> \n<p>United dropped lots of hints about this approach in late 2013 and early 2014, giving its competitors a pretty decent heads up on where it would, and would not, be selling.  This gives a window to compare how insurers priced in the markets where United decided to compete, and where it didn't.</p> \n<p>The new working paper estimates that premiums for the benchmark plan* on healthcare.gov would have been 5.4 percent lower if United had sold on that federal marketplace. And if all major insurers had jumped into the pool, premiums would have cost 11.1 percent less.</p> \n<p>This matters a lot for shoppers, and the federal government. Obamacare commits the feds to paying a certain percent of low and middle income shoppers' health insurance premiums. If the overall tap is lower, that puts the government on the hook for a smaller share.</p> \n<p>United has <a href=""http://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20140519/NEWS/305199964/insurance-exchange-premiums-shouldnt-spike-in-2015-study"">already indicated </a>plans to expand into other markets next year, which could be good news for insurance premiums in 2015.</p> \n"

Some are pet favorites of legislators, who tacked a tiny provision into a very large law. Others raise small amounts of revenue to help pay for the insurance expansion. And others are just... weird. Here are 21 programs that are, indeed, part of Obamacare.</p> \n<h3><span>1. Obamacare makes funds available for ""training for adulthood."" True story. </span></h3> \n<p><span></span>The law makes funds available for ""personal responsibility"" programs aimed at preparing young adults for being grown-ups. Per federal law, all of these programs must include efforts to educate young adults prevention of both pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases.

The government taxes the tanning salon, but that cost is passed on indirectly to consumer. The thinking behind the tanning salon tax is that tanning is super unhealthy — it's linked to deadly skin cancer, which is expensive to for the health care system to treat. This tax helps pay for Obamacare.</p> \n<p class=""caption""><img src=""http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/assets/4500017/924707.jpg"" class=""photo"" alt=""924707""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Donald Miralle/Getty Images Sport</p> \n<h3>3. Now the cost of your insurance appears on your tax forms.</h3> \n<p>Most people have no idea how much their insurance at work actually costs — and this part of Obamacare is supposed to change that.</p> \n<p><span>Employers are the most common source of health insurance in America, and employers usually pick up a big share of the tab. This means that workers sometimes aren't aware just how expensive their coverage is—the </span><a href=""http://kff.org/other/state-indicator/single-coverage/"" style=""line-height: 1.5; background-color: #ffffff;"">Kaiser Family Foundation</a><span> estimates that the average insurance premiums for an individual is $5,384 but the worker only sees 20 percent of that withheld from their paycheck. To promote more awareness, the ACA requires that employers disclose the full cost of an insurance plan (both the employer and the employee share) on the W-2 tax form.</span></p> \n<h3>4. States are allowed to function as laboratories for tort reform, kind of.</h3> \n<p>Specific tort reform efforts — changing the way the system handles medical malpractice lawsuits — didn't make it into Obamacare. However, the law <a href=""http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-111hr3590enr/pdf/BILLS-111hr3590enr.pdf#page=891"">authorizes</a> the Secretary of Health and Human Services to make funds available for states to experiment with different kinds of medical malpractice reform and initiatives to identify, analyze, and reduce medical errors.</p> \n<p>However, there are limits to what these projects can do: they cannot take away a patient's ability to sue if they prefer that over the alternative. So far, it seems that most of the funding has targeted <a href=""http://www.medpagetoday.com/PracticeManagement/Medicolegal/43675"">research</a>.</p> \n<p class=""caption"" style=""text-align: start;""><img src=""http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/assets/4499781/84611044.jpg"" class=""photo"" alt=""84611044""></p> \n<p class=""caption"" style=""text-align: start;"">Joe Raedle/Getty Images News</p> \n<h3>5. Discrimination against plans and providers not offering assisted suicide is explicitly prohibited.</h3> \n<p><span>Physician-assisted suicide is an incredibly controversial topic, and different states have different laws about the practice. A federal law in 1997 prohibited federal funds appropriated by Congress from being used to pay for assisted suicide.</span></p> \n<p style=""font-family: 'Alright Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 15.555556297302246px; line-height: 25px;"">Accordingly, the Affordable Care Act contains language prohibiting discrimination against insurance plans and health care providers who refuse to provide physician-assisted suicide. The law appears to be silent on whether insurers discriminate against providers who <i>do </i>offer physician-assisted suicide.</p> \n<h3>6. The law authorizes funding for grants that target postpartum depression.</h3> \n<p><span>The Secretary of HHS is authorized to make grants available for treating individuals who have postpartum depression and psychosis (conditions that occur in women following childbirth). The law also encourages the National Institute of Mental Health to  conduct long-term study from 2010-2019 on how pregnancy affects women's mental health.</span></p> \n<p style=""font-family: 'Alright Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 15.555556297302246px; line-height: 25px;"">This piece of the Affordable Care Act is called the <a href=""http://olpa.od.nih.gov/legislation/108/pendinglegislation/postpartum.asp"">Melanie Blocker Stokes CARE Act</a>; it is named for a woman who tragically committed suicide in 2001 after suffering from postpartum depression despite three admissions to Chicago-area hospitals following her delivery.</p> \n<p class=""caption""><img src=""http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/assets/4499873/167072087.jpg"" class=""photo"" alt=""167072087""><span>BSIP/Universal Images Group</span></p> \n<h3>7. And it created the Elder Justice Act.</h3> \n<p>Over 500,000 elderly adults are victims of ""elder abuse""—this can take the form of physical, sexual, or psychological abuse, as well as neglect, abandonment, and financial exploitation. As the Boomers reach retirement age and the population's share of elderly individuals grows, so will this problem.</p> \n<p>The law established an Elder Justice Coordinating Council and Advisory Board, tasked with the coordination of research, training, and data collection regarding elder justice programs. Additionally, grant funding is made available to support the research and resolution of elder abuse.</p> \n<h3>8. Large employers must auto-enroll new employees into insurance.</h3> \n<p>Employers with more than 200 full-time employees that offer health coverage are required to sign employees up for the plan. This provision is expected to boost overall insurance enrollment among large employers. T<span>he process must provide adequate opportunity for an employee to decline the coverage if they prefer not to enroll. </span></p> \n<h3>9. Starting in 2016, people will be able to buy insurance across state lines.</h3> \n<p>Selling insurance across state lines is a favorite health policy talking point for conservatives. Starting in 2016, that can happen: states will be able to form compacts that allow consumers to buy insurance across state lines.</p> \n<p>There is some red tape: <span>coverage offered through the compacts must comply with Obamacare, which means they have to provide the same mandatory benefits and protections against high out-of-pocket costs that current exchange plans offer. Moreover, </span><span>i</span><span>nterstate health compacts will require </span><a href=""http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/18053"">approval from the Secretary of Health and Human Services</a> <span>before they are recognized and permitted to enroll people.</span></p> \n<h3>10. Young adults who age out of the foster system at 18 receive benefits until they're 26.</h3> \n<p>Before the Affordable Care Act, states had the option — but not the requirement — of extending Medicaid coverage up to age 21 for kids who aged out of the foster system at 18. <span> </span><span>This is an incredibly vulnerable population that suffers from </span><a href=""http://www.childrensrights.org/issues-resources/foster-care/facts-about-aging-out/"">high rates</a> <span>of homelessness, poverty, and unemployment. </span><span>Under reform, states have to offer these young adults Medicaid coverage until they turn 26.</span></p> \n<h3>11. Private insurers have to help you quit smoking without out-of-pocket costs.</h3> \n<p>Private insurers are required to offer smoking cessation aids (like nicotine gum or patches) to enrollees without co-pay as a form of basic preventive care. Those rules don't apply to Medicaid, but <a href=""http://kff.org/medicaid/state-indicator/cessation-treatment-under-medicaid/"">most states</a> already cover a variety of smoking cessation tools for their Medicaid enrollees.</p> \n<p><img src=""http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/assets/4499889/151059339.jpg"" class=""photo"" alt=""151059339""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">BSIP/Universal Images Group</p> \n<h3><span>12. The law aims to increase breast health awareness among young women. </span></h3> \n<p>The law tasks the Secretary of HHS and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention with conducting an educational campaign to generate awareness about breast cancer and other breast-related health issues among young women aged 15 to 44. Similar campaigns are to be conducted with health care providers, so they can better counsel young women on these issues.</p> \n<h3>13. Employers are required to provide reasonable break time for nursing mothers.</h3> \n<p>Employers must provide a reasonable amount of break time — and a private place that isn't a bathroom — for an employee to express breast milk for up to one year after giving birth. <span>Breastfeeding the first six months, at a minimum, is recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics. </span><span>Prior to health reform, there was no federal law that protected nursing mothers; state laws on the issue tended to be very general.</span></p> \n<h3>14. Restaurant chains need to post calorie and nutrition labels.</h3> \n<p>Those labels you've seen at McDonalds, telling you a Quarter Pounder with cheese has <a href=""http://www.mcdonalds.com/us/en/food/product_nutrition.sandwiches.286.quarter-pounder-with-cheese.html"">520 calories</a>? Those are definitely Obamacare.</p> \n<p>Any restaurant chain with 20 or more locations must display calorie content directly on menus and menu boards. Eventually, this will be accompanied by the suggested daily calorie intake (the FDA hasn't finalized their <a href=""http://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceRegulation/GuidanceDocumentsRegulatoryInformation/LabelingNutrition/ucm223408.htm"">regulations</a> on that yet). Additionally, the law provides $25 million to combat childhood obesity from 2010 through 2014.</p> \n<p class=""caption""><img src=""http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/assets/4499913/108820251.jpg"" class=""photo"" alt=""108820251""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">AFP/Getty Images</p> \n<h3><span>15. Obamacare extended funding for abstinence education.</span></h3> \n<p>Since 1998, $50 million has been appropriated each year to support abstinence education. This funding, which was initially supposed to terminate in 2002, but has been subsequently extended through various legislation. Obamacare extended this funding through September 2014.</p> \n<h3>16. The law directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to conduct a 5-year oral health campaign.</h3> \n<p>Among her many responsibilities, Sec. Sebelius is charged with getting more Americans to brush their teeth.</p> \n<p>The campaign is supposed to focus on the prevention of cavities, periodontal disease, and oral cancer and improve access to dental care among children. The Secretary is further directed to update health monitoring surveys to better capture data on oral health.</p> \n<p class=""caption""><img src=""http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/assets/4499849/151056715.jpg"" class=""photo"" alt=""151056715""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">BSIP/Universal Images Group</p> \n<h3>17. Black liquor doesn't get a tax break anymore.</h3> \n<p>Black liquor isn't actually a liquor; it's a kind of biofuel created as <span>a byproduct of the paper-making process </span><span>and had been eligible for the cellulosic biofuel credit. In 2009, the biofuel world experienced some drama because paper companies were allegedly gaming the system by mixing diesel fuel into their black liquor, allowing them to </span><a href=""http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=abDjfGgdumh4"">claim billions</a><span> in tax credits. To address this, the ACA includes a provision to exclude black liquor from the cellulosic biofuel tax credit going forward—this is one of the offsets used to pay for the law. </span></p> \n<h3>18. Insurers have to include a certain number of hospitals in their plans.</h3> \n<p><span>People worry that plans on the state exchanges won't offer a wide enough selection of clinicians to meet patient need and demand. ""Network adequacy requirements"" are intended to deal with that concern.</span></p> \n<p>To be ""<a href=""http://www.rwjf.org/content/dam/farm/reports/issue_briefs/2013/rwjf407486"">adequate</a>"" an insurer's network needs to offer a sufficient number and variety of doctors and other providers. Plans must also include ""essential community providers,"" who predominantly serve populations often marginalized by the health care system. I<span>t's tough to say what this looks like in practice; the feds painted network adequacy in broad strokes, but gave the </span><a href=""http://theincidentaleconomist.com/wordpress/will-reference-pricing-be-abused/"">states</a><span> a lot of power to shape their own standards.</span></p> \n<h3>19. It's easier for students going into primary care and nursing to get loans.</h3> \n<p>There is a shortage of doctors who practice primary care, which has been attributed to the high cost of medical school and the low compensation for primary care physicians (relative to physicians who specialize). Health reform eased several rules that govern federal loans to medical students who commit to practicing primary care.</p> \n<p>It also increased the maximum loan amounts permitted in the federal nursing student loan program, as a <a href=""http://www.aacn.nche.edu/media-relations/fact-sheets/nursing-shortage"">nursing shortage</a> is predicted by 2025.</p> \n<p class=""caption"" style=""text-align: start;""><img src=""http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/assets/4499817/151042897.jpg"" class=""photo"" alt=""151042897""></p> \n<p class=""caption"" style=""text-align: start;"">BSIP/Universal Images Group</p> \n<h3>20. $25 million is given each year for a decade to help pregnant and parenting teens and college students.</h3> \n<p>The law earmarks $25 million annually over ten years for a new federal <a href=""http://www.hhs.gov/ash/oah/oah-initiatives/paf/home.html"">Pregnancy Assistance Fund</a>, for the purpose of assisting pregnant and parenting teens and college students.

""Ten Senate Democrats are apparently prepared to vote against Murthy's confirmation because of his personal views on firearms — a demonstration of just how much political power our legislators have ceded to the NRA,"" they write. ""By obstructing the President's nomination of Vivek Murthy as surgeon general, the NRA is taking its single-issue political blackmail to a new level.""</p> \n<p>Murthy testified that he would focus on the nation's <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/5/22/5741256/america-is-fat-because-we-exercise-a-little-more-and-eat-a-lot-more"">obesity epidemic</a>, not gun violence, during his tenure as surgeon general.</p> \n<p>The reforms Murthy proposes in that letter —universal background checks, mandatory waiting periods, eliminating prohibitions on gun violence research, a ban on assault weapons — are mainstream with the public and with leaders in public health.

""This incident — like many others — underscores that gun violence is indeed a major public health concern,"" said Harold Pollack, co-director of the University of Chicago Crime Lab.

In other words: companies are asking workers to take on an increasingly large share of their insurance bills. Which means that some of the slowdown isn't trickling down to what families see themselves paying for coverage in 2014.</p>"

"The VA scandal, explained",http://www.vox.com/2014/5/22/5739714/the-va-scandal-explained,These problems are the root of the VA scandal.,"<p><b>Update</b>: This article is a preliminary explainer. For a more in-depth version, check out our card stack <a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/va-scandal-explained/"">here</a>.</p> \n<p>The US Department of Veterans Affairs scandal is, at its heart, a fight over scheduling procedures.</p> \n<p>Over the past few weeks, allegations have surfaced that the VA's shoddy scheduling practices at its medical facilities have put the lives of veterans in danger — and, in some cases, contributed to patient deaths.  The problems all seem to stem from abuses of the scheduling system that the veterans' hospitals use — particularly, from hospital administrators hiding thousands of patients on secret waiting lists.</p> \n<p>This is becoming a really big deal. Reports now allege that scheduling issues at the Phoenix, Arizona, VA hospital led to 40 deaths. President Barack Obama is <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/5/21/5738446/obama-on-va-scandal-i-will-not-tolerate-it"">talking about it</a>. The White House and VA are both conducting investigations, and Congress is holding hearings about the issue.</p> \n<h3>What went wrong?</h3> \n<p>In short, multiple pressures have worked together to create perverse incentives and confusion at VA hospitals around the country:</p> \n<ol> \n<li>The VA has always struggled to keep up with demand. Simply put, there are way too many veterans seeking care for the amount of doctors the VA employs.<br> </li> \n<li>The VA's scheduling policies, which aim to keep veterans from waiting for health care, are very ambiguous, yet they're also the basis for how VA hospitals are evaluated. The ambiguity and incentive create confusion at localized VA hospitals about how, exactly, veterans should be scheduled, which further exacerbates the VA's struggles to keep up with health-care demands.<br> </li> \n<li>Fixing the VA's scheduling policies might not solve the VA's inability to treat all the veterans it cares for in short order. But since the policies push VA hospitals to treat veterans in a timely manner, changing the policies can eliminate perverse incentives for providers, like perhaps those in Phoenix, to hide the veterans who are waiting in line.</li> \n<li>There's historically been little federal oversight over the VA's localized medical centers. That's allowed some hospitals and clinics to get away with shoddy, sometimes nefarious scheduling practices that left sick veterans waiting for necessary health care — and sometimes dying as a result.<br> </li> \n<li>Some advocates also point to funding problems. The VA already struggles to keep up with demand. If homecoming veterans increase demand for medical care and <a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/health-care-spending/is-health-care-spending-growing"">health-care costs continue to rise</a>, the waiting problems could get worse if Congress doesn't allocate more funding.</li> \n</ol> \n<h3>What went wrong at the Phoenix hospital in particular?</h3> \n<center> \n<p><img src=""http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/assets/4493569/74122014.jpg"" class=""photo"" alt=""74122014""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Charles Ommanney / Getty Images News</p> \n</center> \n<p>It's important to emphasize that everything at the Phoenix facility is, for now, a series of allegations. It's not confirmed that 40 veterans died as a result of shoddy practices. The investigations will find out whether that's really what happened.</p> \n<p>With that caveat out of the way, here's what we know so far: CNN <a href=""http://www.cnn.com/2014/04/23/health/veterans-dying-health-care-delays/"">reported</a> that a secret wait list may have contributed to the deaths of 40 veterans and delays for as many as 1,400 to 1,600 sick veterans.</p> \n<p><a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/5/28/5758154/report-veterans-in-phoenix-wait-115-days-for-health-care"">A preliminary report</a> from the VA's inspector general confirmed that at least 1,700 veterans were waiting for care outside the official system. The inspector general also found veterans waited an average of 115 days for their first primary care appointment — much longer than the 14-day goal set by the VA and the 24 days previously reported by Phoenix officials.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""right"">the allegations have grown beyond Phoenix</q></p> \n<p>How did Phoenix officials allegedly conduct this grand scheme? It's simple: they supposedly kept a secret wait list on paper, not on the electronic system that's used for federal oversight, which kept Phoenix's practices out of sight of federal officials. At the same time, Phoenix officials allegedly sent a different, doctored electronic wait list to federal officials that misleadingly showed the hospital tending to patients in a timely manner.</p> \n<p>Since the initial reports, the allegations have grown beyond Phoenix. <span>The American Legion, a veterans advocacy group, has </span><a href=""http://www.legion.org/documents/legion/pdf/va_epidemic.pdf"" style=""line-height: 1.5; background-color: #ffffff;"">tracked</a><span> scheduling issues in up to 18 states.</span></p> \n<center> \n<p><a href=""http://www.legion.org/documents/legion/pdf/va_epidemic.pdf""><img src=""http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/assets/4491805/VA_problems.png"" class=""photo"" alt=""Va_problems""></a></p> \n</center> \n<h3>Who's been affected by these wait times?</h3> \n<p>At this point, all kinds of veterans from all over the country have been affected by the VA's scheduling problems. But cancer patients in particular seem to have been hit the worst in several cases.</p> \n<p>A previous   <a href=""http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/assets/4492093/VA_FactSheet.pdf"">fact sheet from the VA</a> linked 23 patients' deaths to delays in gastrointestinal cancer tests and treatments. CNN <a href=""http://www.cnn.com/2014/04/23/health/veterans-dying-health-care-delays/"">tracked</a> one particular veteran, 71-year-old Thomas Breen, who died of bladder cancer after waiting for months just to set up an appointment. By the time Breen's family got a call from the VA to schedule an appointment, Breen was dead.</p> \n<h3>How did all of this go so wrong?</h3> \n<center> \n<p><img src=""http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/assets/4493585/71656152.jpg"" class=""photo"" alt=""71656152""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Jeff Hutchens / Getty Images News</p> \n</center> \n<p>Ideally, the scheduling system would work much like a typical trip to  the doctor's office: a patient and doctor's office would work out the  time for an appointment, the appointment would be scheduled, and the  patient would make the trip to the doctor on the scheduled date.</p> \n<p>At the VA, there are rules to try to ensure patients are seen in a  timely manner, typically within 14 to 30 days. If it takes longer than  90 days to schedule a patient due to overcapacity, waiting veterans are  supposed to be entered into an electronic wait list that tracks patients  and makes sure their appointments are prioritized.</p> \n<p>But that's not how it works in practice. And since as far back as 2000, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) has been <a href=""http://www.gao.gov/products/HEHS-00-90"">calling on</a> the VA to adjust its scheduling policies. Most recently, the GAO reported problems in  <a href=""http://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-13-130"">2013</a> and <a href=""http://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-14-509T"">2014</a>.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""right"">""the way the system is set up, if someone wanted to go in and manipulate it, it would not be hard to do""</q></p> \n<p>Debra Draper, health-care director at the GAO, points to the lack of oversight and ambiguous policies as the two main drivers of scheduling problems. As she explains it, the VA's policies make it unclear whether, for example, hospitals are supposed to prioritize physician's or patient's desired dates for appointments.</p> \n<p>These issues, of course, might not explain nefarious cases like those alleged in Phoenix, where medical providers are accused of purposely gaming the system to mask long wait times. But it does explain some of the many other scheduling problems now popping up across the country, where confusion and ambiguity in policies have led schedulers to inadvertently do the wrong thing.</p> \n<p>There is also weak federal oversight, which allows problems like those found in Phoenix to go on as no one checks in to ensure rules are being followed. One example of such lax oversight: the GAO, in one of its reviews, found three of four clinics certified themselves as in compliance with scheduling policies, but none of them actually were. The VA could, in theory, audit these facilities, but it rarely does — largely because the issues were out of the public spotlight until now.</p> \n<p>""Certainly, the way the system is set up, if someone wanted to go in   and manipulate it, it would not be hard to do,"" Draper said <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/5/14/5714574/what-the-hell-is-happening-at-the-va"">a previous interview</a>. ""But in   some facilities, they just don't really understand what they're supposed   to do, and sometimes they do things incorrectly. It really gets back  to  the ambiguity in the policies and processes, and on top of that the   lack of oversight.""</p> \n<h3>Why can't the VA just schedule patients in a timely manner?</h3> \n<center> \n<p><img alt=""488810817"" class=""photo"" src=""http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/assets/4495901/488810817.jpg""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Christian Petersen / Getty Images News</p> \n</center> \n<p>In short, the VA has more patients than it can take in.</p> \n<p><span>""We were told by staff in some facilities that increased demand and shortages of some physician specialties contributed to the wait times,"" Draper wrote in an email.</span></p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""right"">""We were told by staff in some facilities that increased demand and shortages of some physician specialties contributed to the wait times""</q></p> \n<p>Some of those shortages represent a nationwide problem with <a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/south-obamacare-medicaid/southerners-report-the-most-trouble-accessing-affordable-health-care"">doctor shortages</a>, but part of the problem could be rooted in roadblocks put up by the VA. Right now, doctors need to get certified by the American Board of Medical Specialties and the American Osteopathic Association to work for the VA. The American Board of Physician Specialties (ABPS) has <a href=""http://www.abpsus.org/va-physician-shortage-and-abps"">criticized</a> this requirement: it argues that smaller boards like ABPS should be able to certify health workers and, therefore, speed up the approval process.</p> \n<p>Increased demand is also a looming problem: thousands of military veterans have come home from Afghanistan and Iraq in the past decade. That's kept the amount of veterans in the VA system up, and it could increase demand further in the future as veterans get older and, most likely, sicker.</p> \n<p>Others blame the scheduling issues on funding problems. A whistleblower, for instance, <a href=""http://washingtonexaminer.com/whistleblower-veterans-affairs-denied-delayed-tests-to-cut-costs/article/2548327"">told</a> the Washington Examiner that cost-cutting measures led to delays in life-saving cancer tests. Richard Krugman, a former VA doctor whose complaints were in part <a href=""http://www.osc.gov/FY2014/14-2%20DI-11-3558/14-2%20DI-11-3558%20-%20Letter%20to%20the%20President.pdf"">verified</a> by the VA, claimed his boss required patients to test positive in three successive screenings for bloody stools before they could get colonoscopies. As a result, Krugman estimated that 15,000 patients who should have gotten colonoscopies never did or had their care delayed.</p> \n<p>But the VA hasn't been doing so bad when it comes to funding in recent years. President Barack Obama has <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/transcript-obamas-remarks-on-va-allegations/2014/05/21/b7116db2-e0f6-11e3-9743-bb9b59cde7b9_story.html"">bragged</a> about increasing VA funding during his time in office. Indeed, <a href=""http://www.va.gov/budget/docs/summary/Fy2015-FastFactsVAsBudgetHighlights.pdf"">the VA's budget numbers</a> show discretionary spending — most of which goes to medical services — rising over the years.</p> \n<p><img src=""http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/assets/4492151/VA_discretionary_funding_by_fiscal_year.png"" class=""photo"" alt=""Va_discretionary_funding_by_fiscal_year""></p> \n<p>Still, some groups think more funding is needed. Veterans advocates previously pushed Congress to pass a $24 billion bill that would expand education and health services for veterans, but Senate Republicans <a href=""http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/02/27/us-usa-veterans-congress-idUSBREA1Q26O20140227"">blocked the bill</a> due to budget concerns.</p> \n<p>Whether the ongoing scheduling problems would be fixed with more money is, however, a matter of debate. Draper argued that, based on the GAO's findings, many of the issues are strictly about the policies and how they're set, not funding.</p> \n<h3>What could be done to fix these issues?</h3> \n<p>The first step, obviously, is to find out what's actually happening on the ground. For that, the VA has <a href=""http://www.va.gov/opa/pressrel/pressrelease.cfm?id=2541"">launched</a> its own investigations, and the White House sent a top aide to Phoenix and <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/5/21/5738446/obama-on-va-scandal-i-will-not-tolerate-it/in/5488789"">promised</a> to hold anyone involved in the scandal accountable.</p> \n<center> \n<p><img src=""http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/assets/4493749/84184963_1_.jpg"" class=""photo"" alt=""84184963_1_""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Mandel Ngan / AFP via Getty Images</p> \n</center> \n<p>The next step, critics argue, is to ensure these issues don't happen again in the future by fixing the underlying problems.</p> \n<p>Along with its findings, the GAO recommended VA administrators take steps to impose more stringent scheduling standards and regularly check if they're being enforced through increased oversight at both the federal and local levels. But, years later, the VA is still looking into how to apply many of the suggestions instead of actually implementing them.</p> \n<p>Beyond these measures, Draper says the VA's inadequate scheduling system, which is now more than 25 years old, is in dire need of upgrades. But upgrading these systems would presumably require more funding, which might not be able to make it through <a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/congressional-dysfunction/what-is-congressional-dysfunction"">a dysfunctional Congress</a>.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""center"">The next step is to ensure these issues don't happen again in the future by fixing the underlying problems</q></p> \n<p>Several veterans groups regularly put out <a href=""http://www.independentbudget.org/"">a dream budget</a> with policy and funding proposals that usually calls for more  funding  than Congress and the White House ultimately allocate. The  latest  budget in particular told lawmakers to avoid cutting  funding to  the  VA's medical services in the future, because it could cripple the system  as more veterans from  Iraq and  Afghanistan demand care.</p> \n<p>The right-leaning advocacy group Concerned Veterans for America also has <a href=""http://vaaccountability.com/"">some suggestions</a>. One proposal to increase accountability would allow top VA officials to more easily fire underperfoming VA managers and employees — something that is reportedly very difficult today. The House of Representatives already <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2014/05/21/what-is-the-va-accountability-act/"">approved</a> a bill doing just this, but it's uncertain if it will make it through the Senate.</p> \n<p>Another suggestion would let veterans, particularly those in parts of the country where no well-run VA facilities are available, get VA-funded care at non-VA hospitals and clinics. That would, of course, present a radical departure from the centralized health care the VA currently provides. But it also might ease wait times and demand at current VA facilities, while letting veterans get the best care they can possibly obtain.</p> \n<h3>What else should I read about this?</h3> \n<ul> \n<li>Vox's <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/5/14/5714574/what-the-hell-is-happening-at-the-va"">previous explainer</a> gave an early look at the issue.</li> \n<li>Since the allegations in Phoenix broke, the Arizona Republic has been <a href=""http://www.azcentral.com/story/news/arizona/politics/2014/04/25/pheonix-va-health-care-meet-reporters/8176785/"">on top</a> of the scheduling problems.</li> \n<li>The Washington Post also put up <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2014/05/15/a-guide-to-the-va-health-care-controversy/"">its own explainer</a> of the political angles behind the issue.</li> \n<li>The American Legion, which advocates for veterans, has <a href=""http://www.legion.org/dyinginline"">a great page</a> on the issue.</li> \n</ul>"
America is fat because we exercise a little more and eat a lot more,http://www.vox.com/2014/5/22/5741256/america-is-fat-because-we-exercise-a-little-more-and-eat-a-lot-more,"Obesity rates are rising just as quickly among nearly every demographic, geographic and socioeconomic group you can measure.","<p><span>From Colorado to Mississippi, Americans are getting fatter at nearly the exact same rate.</span></p> \n<p>Nearly all data on the obesity crisis shows big disparities in the percent of the population that is overweight. Southern states, for example, tend to have higher obesity rates than those in the Northeast. Rates are higher among those with lower-incomes than high earners, and also higher in minority populations.</p> \n<p>But this, long-time obesity research Roland Sturm argues, misses something really important about how the obesity has unfolded over the past few decades. Across different geographies, ethnic groups and income-levels, obesity rates are growing just as quickly.</p> \n<p>This doesn't mean there isn't a gap: there's a higher prevalence of obesity among less educated Americans than those with college diplomas. But it does mean that the obesity rate is growing at the same rate among the two groups, Sturm's <a href=""http://www.rand.org/news/press/2014/05/22.html"">new research </a>shows.</p> \n<p><img src=""http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/assets/4493897/obesity2.png"" class=""photo"" alt=""Obesity2""></p> \n<p>The same pattern shows up with ethnic groups, too.</p> \n<p><img src=""http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/assets/4493913/obesity3.png"" class=""photo"" alt=""Obesity3""></p> \n<p>""If you look at a map of obesity rates, you might think, Colorado has been able to buck the trend and avoid this whole mess,"" Sturm, an economist at the RAND Institute said.

This suggests to him its not, for example, food deserts that are driving the obesity epidemic, if rates are going up just as quickly in places where there are ample food options, that suggests the lack of healthy choices isn't necessarily to blame.</p> \n<p>So what is to blame? It's pretty much all about Americans eating more. A lot more.  Americans pretty much everywhere consume more calories than they did a few decades ago.</p> \n<p><img src=""http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/assets/4493921/calorie_consumption.png"" class=""photo"" alt=""Calorie_consumption""></p> \n<p>Americans are actually eating more vegetables, and slightly more fruit, than we used to.

Wages, by contrast, are taxable. This means a dollar paid toward health insurance goes farther than a dollar paid toward salary.</span></p> \n<p>Most big employers currently offer insurance. But the fear is that t<span>he health insurance exchanges — and the subsidies that come with those plans for some families — might give them a reason to stop. Instead, they might just pay the penalty and ""dump"" their employees on the exchanges. </span><span>This would be less expensive for the employer than offering full health benefits, and it might even be better for the employees. But it will be worse for taxpayers who have to pick up the tab for the subsidies. </span></p> \n<h3>What did the IRS do about employer dumping?</h3> \n<p>Employers can still cease offering health insurance and dump their employees into the exchanges.

The only way for employers to spend on health insurance tax free is to offer the insurance themselves.</p> \n<h3>Is there evidence of employers dumping so far?</h3> \n<p>There's no hard evidence showing a trend among large businesses to move their workers from employer-sponsored coverage to state exchanges. The closest is <span>the withdrawal of health insurance offers for some part-time employees, who businesses are not required to cover under Obamacare. </span><a style=""background-color: #ffffff; line-height: 1.5;"" href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/09/13/what-trader-joes-teaches-us-about-obamacare/"">Trader Joe</a><span>, </span><a style=""background-color: #ffffff; line-height: 1.5;"" href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/clareoconnor/2014/01/22/target-joins-home-depot-walmart-others-in-dropping-health-care-for-part-timers-citing-obamacare/"">Home Depot</a><span>, and other retailers</span><b style=""line-height: 1.5;""> </b><span>have made this move, arguing that their part-timers are better off with higher wages and the more generous coverage they'll receive through the exchanges.</span></p> \n<p>There are also <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/21/us/public-sector-cuts-part-time-shifts-to-duck-insurance-law.html"">anecdotal reports</a> of employers scaling back hours so that employees count as part-time, not full-time, absolving employers of their responsibility to provide health coverage.

They're not getting it at all. They're going completely uninsured when federal law grants them comprehensive coverage.

Introducing a $10 premium makes enrollees 12 to 15 percentage points more likely to exit the program. Though premiums got more expensive as enrollee income increased, these changes had little or no effect on enrollment.</p> \n<p><span>This matters because a handful of states pursuing alternative Medicaid expansions have proposed premiums for enrollees between 100 and 138 percent of the federal poverty line.

But it seems like there was something around the economic uncertainty of the late 2000s and early 2010s that may have played a role in fewer teens becoming pregnant.</p> \n<h3>2. Teens are using more effective contraceptives</h3> \n<p>Long-acting reversible contraceptives like IUDs tend to be a really effective form of birth control, way more effective than condoms or even the pill. And teens are increasingly using them: the percentage of women 15 to 19 who use long-acting reversible contraceptives<a href=""https://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/journals/j.fertnstert.2012.06.027.pdf""> tripled</a> between 2007 and 2009.</p> \n<div style=""text-align:center""> \n<p><img src=""http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/assets/4517325/larcs.png"" class=""photo"" alt=""Larcs""></p> \n</div> \n<p>IUD and other long-acting contraceptive users are still a small minority of teenagers; many more rely on condoms or birth control pills. It's also lower than the adoption rate for older women (11 percent of 25 to 29-year-olds, for example, use contraceptives like IUDs). But its still a significant increase in the use of some of the most effective contraceptives, which could be part of the story of the lower birth rate.</p> \n<h3>3. There are fewer kids of teen moms</h3> \n<p>There's a wide body of research showing that children of teen moms are more likely to become teen parents themselves. The daughters of teen moms, for example, are<a href=""https://www.dosomething.org/tipsandtools/background-teenage-pregnancy""> 22 percent</a> more likely to become teen mothers than kids born to older parents.</p> \n<p><span>The teen birth rate has been steadily declining since the 1990s. And that means there are fewer kids born with this particular risk factor,  also contributing to the overall decline.</span></p> \n<h3><span>4.

These services are usually available to women 18 and over.</p> \n<p>Economists Melissa Kearney and Phillip Levine<a href=""http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/research/files/papers/2008/7/reducing%20pregnancy%20kearney/07_reducing_pregnancy_kearney.pdf""> looked at</a> how those changes effected birth rates, and found that, between 1990 and 2002, the expansion of Medicaid family planning services was responsible for a 7 percent decline in births to 18 and 19 year-olds.</p> \n<h3>5.

The theory here is that the show pretty accurately depicts the difficulties of raising a child while still in high school, and serves as a warning sign about teen pregnancy rather than glamorizing the subject.</span></p> \n<p><span>This paper, also by Kearney and Levine, examined Nielsen rating data to see where viewers were watching the show and where they weren't. They also looked at searches and tweets related to the show.</span></p> \n<p>They compared that information against federal data on teen birth rates by state. There was a ""pronounced"" drop off in births among those who watched the show in great numbers. More specifically, Kearney and Levine estimate that the two shows are responsible for a 5.7 percent decline in the teen birth rate from 2009 to 2011.</p> \n<h3><span>6. Teenage boys are having less sex</span></h3> \n<div style=""text-align:center""> \n<p><img src=""http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/assets/4523439/teenage_sex.png"" class=""photo"" alt=""Teenage_sex""></p> \n</div> \n<p>The Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance Survey shows, over the past three decades, a general decline in the share of male teenagers having sex (although there has been a slight uptick in recent years). There have also been increases in male high school students using condoms since the 1990s. This could be a product of concern over HIV/AIDS infection, which may have had the side effect of preventing teenage pregnancies.</p>"

"The fiercest debate in health care is about a $1,000 pill",http://www.vox.com/2014/5/28/5757706/the-fiercest-debate-in-health-care-is-about-a-1000-pill,Sovaldi is remarkably good at curing hepatitis C. It's also remarkably expensive.,"<p><span>Getting health policy wonks riled up right now is incredibly easy. You don't even need to mention Obamacare. Just mention a funny, seven-letter word: Sovaldi.</span></p> \n<p>Sovaldi is the new hepatitis C treatment that pharmaceutical company Gilead released earlier this year. Sovaldi is remarkably effective; it cures <a href=""http://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2014/04/23/306236511/costly-hepatitis-c-pill-shreds-drug-industry-sales-record"">90 percent </a>of patients with a certain strain of hepatitis C in 12 weeks.</p> \n<p>Sovaldi is also remarkably expensive. Each pill costs $1,000 and a full course of treatment comes with a $84,000 price tag.</p> \n<p>Other speciality drugs have come with similarly high prices, but they usually treat relatively rare cancers. More than 3 million Americans are infected with hepatitis C. That makes Sovaldi a drug that could potentially treat lots and lots of patients — and make its price a giant challenge for anyone paying for health care.</p> \n<p><span>California, for example, might have to spend more on buying Sovaldi for its Medicaid beneficiaries than it currently does on all K-12 and higher education. The California estimate includes both the cost of purchasing Sovaldi and having medical professionals administer the drug, which the National Coalition Health Care estimates to be $131,000.</span></p> \n<div style=""text-align:center""><img alt=""Sovaldi_graphic"" class=""photo"" src=""http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/assets/4520419/sovaldi_graphic.png""></div> \n<p>There's a fierce debate going on right now about how much Sovaldi should cost, and how much compensation pharmaceutical companies should — and shouldn't — receive for bringing a new, groundbreaking drug to market.</p> \n<h3>Bringing new drugs to market is expensive...</h3> \n<p>Pharmaceutical companies, unsurprisingly, think they deserve a relatively high level of compensation.</p> \n<p>They point to the fact that bringing a new drug to market is an incredibly expensive endeavor.  If you factor in all the money manufacturers spend on new products that don't pan out, as <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/matthewherper/2012/02/10/the-truly-staggering-cost-of-inventing-new-drugs/"">Forbes' Matthew Herper has</a>, the cost of bringing a single new drug to market can be upwards of $7 billion. These estimates, for what its worth, tend to be on the very high end of drug development cost estimates; other analyses suggest the costs are<a href=""http://Jeff%20Frank%20Press%20Secretary%20Office%20of%20U.S.%20Sen.%20Bernie%20Sanders%20(I-Vt.)%20332%20Dirksen%20Senate%20Office%20Building%20C:%20202-641-3891%20%7C%20O:%20202-228-6357""> much lower</a>.</p> \n<p><img src=""http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/assets/4520499/spending.png"" class=""photo"" alt=""Spending""></p> \n<p><span>Their other main argument: Sovaldi, even with its high price tag, will actually save money by preventing costly cases of liver transplants and liver cancer.</span></p> \n<h3>...But does it justify an $84,000 pricetag?</h3> \n<p>The people who pay for drugs aren't fully buying those arguments — and want Sovaldi to back off its prices. They argue that Gilead could more than cover the costs of drug development and even run a profit with a lower price. This year alone, analysts expect Sovaldi to generate as much as <a href=""http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/04/10/us-hepatitis-gilead-phrma-idUSBREA391I220140410"">$15 billion in sales</a>.</p> \n<p>""This represents an abuse of market power,"" says John Rother, who runs the National Coalition on Health Care. His group announced Wednesday a new Campaign for Sustainable Rx Pricing, that will push specifically for Sovaldi to lower its prices.</p> \n<p>""We grant exclusive rights to companies to reward them for their innovation, but with that power comes great responsibility. Not just to the shareholders of the company, but to the broader society. ""</p> \n<p>Sovaldi is proving difficult for health care providers to actually afford. It's a challenge for Medicaid directors, for example, are torn over whether the drug is worth it — and trying to <a href=""http://www.medpagetoday.com/InfectiousDisease/Hepatitis/45944"">write guidelines </a>for which patients are most likely to do best with Sovaldi, limiting treatment to that particular group to save on costs.</p> \n<p>The insurance industry has become increasingly critical of Sovaldi, arguing that the price is simply unaffordable for patients. Bloomberg's Drew Armstrong<a href=""http://washpost.bloomberg.com/Story?docId=1376-N1VD2A6VDKI201-1K3M0QPDP9CRC5BUM2FHJ32QO5""> ran the numbers </a>and estimates that, if every hepatitis C patient in the US were treated with Sovaldi at its list price, it would cost $227 billion. Right now, we currently spend $260 billion for <i>all </i>drugs.</p> \n<p>""Sovaldi has shown tremendous results, and it's the kind of medical innovation we need to sustain,"" Karen Ignangi, head of America's Health Insurance Plans, said in a pointed statement last week. ""Unfortunately, the drug's maker - taking advantage of a lack of competition - has priced it at an astronomical level that is not sustainable for consumers, innovation, or society.""</p> \n<h3>Pressure to lower the price</h3> \n<p>Rother's new campaign brings together 80 different groups all pressuring Gilead to lower Sovaldi's price. Rother says he's had initial meetings with Gilead so far, but not to huge success.</p> \n<p>""The meetings have been more to defend their position rather that engage,"" he says.</p> \n<p>It's hard to know at this point whether Gilead will consider lowering its prices. It is, after all, on track to have pretty solid sales numbers — indicating that Sovaldi will sell just fine at its current price.</p> \n<p>Much of the worry in health care circles is what happens next, whether Sovaldi sets a new norm for drug pricing. If the health care system can sustain a $84,000 drug, what's to stop an enterprising pharmaceutical company from pricing their next breakthrough at $100,000?</p> \n<p>""We're at risk of completely unbalancing the system where all the rewards go to one company and the rest of the system is faced with depleted resources,"" Rother says.</p> \n<p>Sovaldi, in other words, could be just the tip of the iceberg.</p> \n<div class=""align-left""></div>"
Report: Veterans in Phoenix wait 115 days for health care,http://www.vox.com/2014/5/28/5758154/report-veterans-in-phoenix-wait-115-days-for-health-care,The report confirms some of critics' worst fears.,"<p>Bad scheduling practices at the Veterans Affairs' health-care facility in Phoenix, Arizona, caused huge delays in care for veterans, <a href=""http://www.va.gov/oig/pubs/VAOIG-14-02603-178.pdf"">a preliminary report</a> from the VA's inspector general confirmed Wednesday.</p> \n<p>The report, which sampled 226 appointments in Phoenix, found that veterans waited an average of 115 days for their first primary care appointment, and approximately 84 percent of veterans waited more than the 14-day goal set by the VA. The average is much higher than the 24 days of waiting reported by Phoenix to the federal VA system.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""right"">The inspector general's findings support some of the allegations leveled against Phoenix officials in recent weeks</q></p> \n<p>The investigation also uncovered multiple lists not in compliance with VA policy. When a patient can't access care in a timely period, local VA officials are supposed to place patients on an electronic wait list that allows local and federal overseers to track and prioritize patients with the longest wait times. The lists found by the inspector general, however, were separate from the official electronic list and fell outside the view of the federal VA system and, therefore, its oversight.</p> \n<p>As a result, the inspector general identified 1,700 veterans who were waiting for care but not found on the VA's official electronic wait list.</p> \n<p>In response to the findings, the inspector general called on VA Secretary Eric Shinseki to immediately take action that would allow the 1,700 waiting veterans to get care. The report also asked Shinseki to undertake a broad review of the Phoenix health-care system and initiate a nationwide review of all veterans waiting for appointments.</p> \n<p>Shinseki pledged in <a href=""http://www.va.gov/opa/pressrel/pressrelease.cfm?id=2545"">a statement</a> to carry out the report's recommendations.</p> \n<p>""We will aggressively and fully implement the remaining OIG [Office of Inspector General] recommendations to ensure that we contact every single Veteran identified by the OIG,"" Shinseki said. ""I have directed the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) to complete a nation-wide access review to ensure a full understanding of VA's policy and continued integrity in managing patient access to care. Further, we are accelerating access to care throughout our system and in communities where Veterans reside.""</p> \n<p>The inspector general's findings support some of the allegations leveled against Phoenix officials in recent weeks. As CNN <a href=""http://www.cnn.com/2014/04/23/health/veterans-dying-health-care-delays/"">reported</a> in April, Phoenix officials allegedly operated a secret wait list that kept thousands of waiting patients off the books.</p> \n<p>The secret list would have allowed Phoenix officials to report considerably better wait times to federal overseers, since the patients waiting the longest didn't show up on the official wait list. The list would also, however, let Phoenix officials delay care for thousands of veterans — and it allegedly led to the deaths of 40 veterans who never got necessary care.</p> \n<p>The preliminary report did not capture how many veterans died while waiting for care in the Phoenix system. The inspector general said investigations into that issue are still ongoing.</p> \n<p>For more information on the VA scandal, read Vox's explainer <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/5/22/5739714/the-va-scandal-explained"">here</a>.</p> \n<p><b>Update</b>: This post was updated on May 28 with VA Secretary Eric Shinseki's statement.</p>"

It seems they decided they would go through it in an inappropriate fashion, and got themselves in a very bad position.</p> \n<p><b>SK: One area you've written extensively on is rationing, and how health care systems prioritize resources. So I was curious how you think about what has been happening at Veterans Affairs, where something appears to have gone clearly wrong with how care was delivered. Are these type of problems endemic to systems with a capped health care budget?</b></p> \n<p>HA: When resources are inadequate, you have to engage in triage of some sort or another. From what I'm gathering in these news reports, they've chosen a particularly unfortunate way of dealing with it. Unfortunate is probably too gentle — stupid is probably a better word.</p> \n<p>The rationing in Britain started with the general practitioners, who would realize there wasn't capacity to take their patients further along in the system, so they would have different standards for referring them for tertiary care. You would have dialysis clinics that were in fact part of a system that was pretty brutally rationing, and patients might never get to them.</p> \n<p>Here, you have the combination of veterans coming back from Iraq and Afghanistan in addition to the increasingly flow of problems from the Vietnam years and the aging of that population.</p> \n<p><b>SK: I've heard some suggestions that what's happening at the VA is a preview of what will happen with <a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/how-doctors-are-paid/what-is-ipab"">IPAB</a>, since that board is charged with getting Medicare costs to grow at a certain rate. The idea I've heard raised is that, with those constrained budgets, you could see similarly mismanaged care.<br></b></p> \n<p>HA: The comparison to the IPAB is, to put it mildly, premature. CBO a couple of years ago said they didn't think anything would happen with IPAB for the next few years since costs have been coming in below costs. Even if members get nominated and appointed, both of which seem remote at a present time, those limits are not going to bite and they're not going to bite hard.</p> \n<p><b>SK: But are there any possible parallels between the idea that Veterans Affairs has to work within a fixed budget, and that's essentially the direction that IPAB wants to push Medicare towards? The idea there, as I understand it, is to constrain Medicare growth to a more predictable target. </b></p> \n<p>HA: The comparison of the IPAB and VA is not helpful at this point. The VA, even back a decade ago, when it was getting all this good press, wasn't able to take care of the entire population who was legally eligible to receive services. Medicare is, and I think virtually everybody recognizes this, part of an overall system where virtually everybody who is a candidate for care gets care.</p> \n<p>[With all the veterans coming back from war now,] it would be like having IPAB set a budget that was in existence for Medicare, and then all of a sudden being told they had to cover the aged population of China in addition to the United States population. That would create chaos. What looks to have happened at the VA is its had a lot of problems dumped on it, with some additional resources.</p> \n<p>The US health-care system spends a lot more than other countries do, but let's just suppose a nuclear war occurred and it dumped millions of millions of people into the system. It would break down for a lack of resources. That isn't what happened in a quantitative sense to the VA but, in a qualitative sense it mirrors what's going on.</p> \n<p><b>SK: It seems like one of the challenges in setting a fixed health care budget is finding a balance between providing enough funding to cover necessary care, but also not enough to be wasting money. How do other countries manage to strike that balance?</b></p> \n<p>HA: It is usually a political process that sets the budget, when you look at other countries. There is some evidence they do it in a way that may produce somewhat fewer services, but do it in a way that commands general, societal support. There are many people who feel that's the wrong way to about things, that it should be set up more through a market process. then there are others who argue that markets don't function well, in the health care system.</p> \n<p><i></i></p>"
Screwed-up bonus payments are at the heart of the VA scandal,http://www.vox.com/2014/5/30/5762482/health-incentives-gone-wrong,"Bonus payments to hospital administrators were supposed to improve VA healthcare. Instead, they made it much worse.","<p>The best-intentioned health care policies don't always lead to the best outcomes for patients.</p> \n<p>This is one problem at the core of the <a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/va-scandal-explained/what-went-wrong-at-the-va"">Veterans Affairs' scandal:</a> administrators received financial bonuses keeping wait times short. The aim of those bonuses was to incentivize good behavior: If there's money to be made in getting patients seen quickly, the reasoning goes, then hospitals will focus on reducing wait times.</p> \n<div class=""align-left""></div> \n<div class=""align-left""></div> \n<p><q class=""left"" aria-hidden=""true"">the va scandal is a scandal about incentives gone wrong</q></p> \n<p>Instead, those extra bonuses appear to have incentivized bad behavior. They gave administrators an incentive to do something easier than improving health care: falsify records to make it look like wait times were shorter, and still net bonus payments.</p> \n<p><span>This is not how the bonus program, obviously, was supposed to work. And it underlines a challenge that's actually much bigger than the Veterans' Affairs scandal: its really difficult, in any hospital, to design payment programs that incentivize doctors to do the right thing.</span></p> \n<p>This is something that American health care system has struggled with for ages — and something that Obamacare hopes to address, too.</p> \n<p>""There certainly can be unintended consequences,"" says Jerry Cromwell, a senior fellow in health economics at RTI International, which helps Health and Human Services evaluate the effectiveness of health incentive programs.</p> \n<h3>The goal: Pay doctors for providing great health care</h3> \n<p>Veterans' Affairs was trying to do something that is becoming increasingly common in health care: paying providers more money when they deliver better health care. This is known, in the health world, as ""pay-for-performance"" or ""value-based care.""</p> \n<p><q class=""center"" aria-hidden=""true"">bonuses for hospitals can have 'unintended consequences'</q></p> \n<p>This is different from the way that insurers and the government usually pay for health care services. For decades now, the health care system has relied on a fee-for-service system, where doctors are paid a flat fee for every service they provide. The financial incentives of a fee-for-service system are pretty terrible. They encourage doctors to provide as much care as possible, regardless of whether it actually helps a patient get any better.</p> \n<p><span>In response, the health care system is slowly shifting </span>towards<span> incentive-based reimbursement that tethers financial rewards to better health care.</span></p> \n<p>The health care law's <a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/how-doctors-are-paid/what-is-the-quality-incentive-program"">value-based purchasing </a>program, for example, takes a small portion of hospitals' reimbursements and puts them in a bonus pool. Hospitals that score high on metrics — how satisfied patients are, for example, and if they get appropriate care — get money out of the bonus pool.</p> \n<p>The hospitals that don't perform don't get bonus payments. And the hope is this will lead to improvements in care. That doesn't, however, always happen.</p> \n<h3>There are lots of ways for incentive programs to go wrong</h3> \n<p>In the case of the VA, the bonus payments appear to have incentivized fraud rather than excellent care. The Daily Beast has<a href=""http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/05/12/did-the-va-pay-out-bonuses-for-screwing-veterans.html""> reported </a>hospital administrators across the country received between $10,000 and $15,000 in bonus payments for submitting falsified records of wait times.</p> \n<div class=""align-right""></div> \n<p><q class=""right"" aria-hidden=""true"">'you have to know the rules of the game you're playing'</q></p> \n<p>""Yes, it is gaming the system a bit,"" one administrator wrote in an email obtained by the Daily Beast. ""But you have to know the rules of the game you are playing, and when we exceed the 14-day measure, the front office gets very upset, which doesn't help us.""</p> \n<p>Officials could have, of course, reported the wait times and raised a red flag about the challenge. But instead, with financial incentives in play, reports suggest they decided to lie about the wait.</p> \n<p>This isn't how other incentive programs go wrong — but there are less nefarious reasons that trying to reward good behavior in health care can create perverse insurance.</p> \n<p>""There are potentially some concerns about these measures,"" Cromwell says. ""Some have to do with reporting, and the accuracy. But others are a concern of teaching to the test. If we identify, for example, 10 major areas to reward and penalize, you could see a lot of effort being put into hitting those metrics.""</p> \n<p>The value-based purchasing program, for example, partially bases bonuses on how satisfied patients are with their care. That seems to make sense: hospitals should care about whether their patients are treated well.</p> \n<p>But some research shows that patient satisfaction actually correlates with <i>worse </i>care. The most satisfied patients, <a href=""http://archinte.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?doi=10.1001/archinternmed.2011.1662&amp;papetoc"">one study found</a>, were most likely to die, possibly because they have doctors who prioritize the care patients want over the care they actually need.</p> \n<p>""Without additional measures,"" a team of researchers at University of California—Davis warned in 2002, ""an overemphasis on patient satisfaction could have unintended adverse effects on health care utilization, expenditures, and outcomes.""</p> \n<h3>Teaching to the test</h3> \n<p><span>Take, for example, one quality measure that hospitals regularly use: whether cardiology patients die within 30 days of their procedure. Hospitals will look at that metric as a way to figure out if their cardiologists are doing a good job, sometimes using it as a way to assign financial bonuses.</span></p> \n<p>The measure, on the face, seems sound: Doctors should be rewarded when their patients don't die. But <a href=""http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/05/12/did-the-va-pay-out-bonuses-for-screwing-veterans.html"">a new analysis </a>last month showed something bizarre: there was an inexplicable uptick in cardiac patients' deaths one day <i>after </i>the 30-day penalty period had ended.</p> \n<p><q class=""center"" aria-hidden=""true"">building good financial incentives in health care is difficult</q></p> \n<p>""At least no one I've talked to has come up with a hypothesis about why you would see that increase,"" says lead study author Bryan Maxwell, a cardiologist at Johns Hopkins University. ""If you have a person whose job it is to do three things, and pay them just for the first thing, naturally they'll focus on doing the first thing really well.""</p> \n<p>Maxwell says its difficult to come up with great quality metrics that aren't too burdensome to implement. Hospitals could, theoretically, track patients for a longer time and across different facilities to get rid of the weird incentives around hitting the 30-day mark. That would require more resources though on their part.</p> \n<p>""It's not benign to say let's just measure five more things,"" Maxwell says. ""Ther'es a balance to be struck between saying we should measure more, and the burden of taking those measurements.""</p>"
Obamacare is going to make the VA's problems worse,http://www.vox.com/2014/5/30/5762688/demand-at-the-va-is-only-going-to-grow,The VA already struggles to meet patient demand. Obamacare will cause that demand to grow.,"<p><span>Despite the ongoing </span><a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/va-scandal-explained/what-went-wrong-at-the-va"">scandal</a><span>, demand for health services at the VA probably won't shrink next year. It will probably grow — and Obamacare is largely to thank. </span></p> \n<p><q class=""right"" aria-hidden=""true"">VETERANS NEED TO FULFILL OBAMACARE'S MANDATE, JUST LIKE EVERYONE ELSE. VA COVERAGE SATISFIES THAT MANDATE.</q></p> \n<p>Nearly ten percent of veterans <span>— about </span><a href=""http://democrats.veterans.house.gov/%E2%80%9CACA-VA-healthcare%E2%80%9D"" style=""background-color: #ffffff;"">1.3 million</a><span> </span><span>men and women who have served our country — </span><span>are uninsured</span><span>. Those </span><span>veterans need to fulfill Obamacare's mandate to carry insurance or else pay a penalty, just like everyone else. </span></p> \n<p>Enrolling in VA coverage satisfies that mandate. This means you could see some veterans who are eligible for health benefits — but haven't yet signed up — deciding to enroll in that coverage to dodge Obamacare's penalties.</p> \n<p>For uninsured vets, VA benefits may be the cheapest health insurance option available. The VA requires co-payments at visits, but not monthly premiums. Veterans could give up their VA coverage and seek subsidies to buy private insurance on a state exchange if their income is low enough to qualify, but any premium associated with an exchange plan — even a very well-subsidized one — is more expensive than no premium at all.</p> \n<p>These new enrollees could strain a health care system already stressed by a lack of resources. A doctor shortage has been plaguing nation for years. The VA isn't immune to these pressure — it is <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/30/us/doctor-shortages-cited-in-va-hospital-waits.html"">reportedly</a> trying to find 400 primary care physicians to fill current vacancies.</p> \n<h3>Veterans also have other options</h3> \n<p>Medicaid may have fewer out-of-pockets costs than VA benefits, but veterans don't have to choose; they can be enrolled in both programs simultaneously. In 2007, eight percent of veterans <a href=""http://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/ftpdocs/104xx/doc10453/08-13-vha.pdf"">reported</a> Medicaid enrollment in addition to their VA benefits. With the Medicaid expansion moving forward in over half of states, that number will grow.</p> \n<p>It's not clear how many of the currently uninsured veterans are eligible for VA benefits; Census data doesn't provide the kind of information necessary to tease that out. But the number is certainly greater than zero, and Obamacare's requirement to carry insurance will probably draw many out of the woodwork.</p> \n<p>The VA certainly expects this to be the case: they <a href=""http://democrats.veterans.house.gov/%E2%80%9CACA-VA-healthcare%E2%80%9D"">requested</a> an additional $85 million in their 2014 budget just to accommodate the hike in enrollment they expect from health reform. Additional funding is necessary but not sufficient to address access issues; the VA needs to actually scale up their capacity, too.</p> \n<p>Medicaid expansion <i>could</i> relieve some pressures on the VA system. <span>For some veterans, geographic access could be a serious barrier to care, since VA benefits are typically provided at VA facilities. </span><span> Medicaid coverage has its own shortcomings, but dual eligibility would permit veterans to seek care wherever it was most readily available. </span></p> \n<p>Of course, almost half of states are still refusing to expand the public program, affecting an estimated <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/5/21/5738512/states-that-refuse-medicaid-are-leaving-over-250000-poor-veterans"">258,600</a> uninsured veterans. <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/5/23/5745356/veterans-aren-t-the-only-ones-waiting-for-health-care"" style=""line-height: 1.5;"">That's a scandal in itself.</a></p>"
A simple guide to how VA health care works,http://www.vox.com/2014/6/1/5762710/a-simple-guide-to-how-va-health-care-works,The VA's health-care system is big and confusing. But it can make sense.,"<p>Behind <a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/va-scandal-explained/what-went-wrong-at-the-va"">the Veterans Affair scandal</a> is a fairly complicated health-care system for veterans.</p> \n<p>The VA operates the Veterans Health Administration, the largest health-care system in the country. It has nearly 9 million enrollees, sees more than 6 million unique patients each year, and operates more than 150 hospitals with a discretionary budget of more than $64 billion.</p> \n<p>How that system operates is crucial for veterans and to fully understand the VA scandal. Given that, here are seven facts about the VA and how it runs its vast health-care network.</p> \n<h3>Not every veteran qualifies for full VA care</h3> \n<center><br></center> \n<p>Contrary to popular belief, veterans don't all get free health care for life.</p> \n<p><q class=""right"" aria-hidden=""true"">The VA operates the largest health-care system in the country</q></p> \n<p>The big qualification is serving in combat. Veterans returning from combat operations can enroll for VA health care within five years of their return, and these veterans remain in the system even after the five years expire.</p> \n<p>If a combat veteran doesn't apply within five years or never took part in combat operations, he or she must fall into different high-priority groups to enroll for VA care: veterans with service-related disabilities, former prisoners of war, veterans exposed to toxic substances and environmental hazards like Agent Orange, low-income veterans, and all veterans from World War I.</p> \n<p>The priority system is also used to dictate how much care a veteran is eligible for, like whether they'll have non-service conditions treated, and how much care will cost in terms of copayments.</p> \n<p>The VA will also sometimes reimburse health-care services to a veteran's dependents. President Barack Obama and Congress in 2010 expanded the reimbursement program to include the primary family caregiver of a veteran if the caregiver doesn't have any other form of health insurance, including Medicaid and Medicare.</p> \n<h3>Veterans pay no premiums for VA care, but they do pay copayments</h3> \n<center> \n<p><img alt=""131277093"" class=""photo"" src=""http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/assets/4543269/131277093.jpg""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">John Moore / Getty Images News</p> \n</center> \n<p>Veterans do not need to pay a premium, the monthly payment many Americans pay for private health insurance, to get VA care.</p> \n<p>Veterans might, however, need to pay a copayment. And these copayments can get pretty pricey: depending on the type and duration of care, copayments can vary from $8 to thousands of dollars, <a href=""http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R42747.pdf"">according to the Congressional Research Service</a>.</p> \n<p>In general, veterans with the worst service-related injuries,  particularly those who can't get a job because of their injuries, are  exempt from most or all copayments. There are also some unique copayment exemptions for very specific circumstances in different theaters of war.</p> \n<h3>The standard VA health-care package doesn't include dental and a few other services</h3> \n<center> \n<p><img alt=""71695319"" class=""photo"" src=""http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/assets/4543285/71695319.jpg""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Chris Hondros / Getty Images News</p> \n</center> \n<p>The VA will cover most of a fully qualifying veteran's medical needs, including women's health services.</p> \n<p>But there are a few exceptions to coverage: abortions or abortion counseling, in-vitro fertilization, drugs not covered by the Food and Drug Administration (such as <a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/marijuana-legalization/what-is-medical-marijuana"">medical marijuana</a>), sex-reassignment surgeries, and memberships in spas and health clubs.</p> \n<p>Dental care is provided, but it's very limited. In most instances, veterans will only get dental care if they have a service-related dental condition or injury.</p> \n<h3>The VA can bill private insurance, but usually not Medicare<br>\n</h3> \n<p>The VA can sometimes shift the costs of a veteran's health-care to  private insurers. In particular, if a veteran has private insurance and  gets treated at a VA facility for injuries or disabilities not related  to military service, the VA can charge the veteran's private plan.</p> \n<p>The VA, though, usually can't charge Medicare, which would amount to  the federal government charging itself. There are some exceptions,  particularly for care provided in an emergency at a VA facility, but  it's generally prohibited by statute.</p> \n<h3>Sometimes, the VA will pay for private care<br>\n</h3> \n<p>The VA will generally pay for private care in a few separate circumstances: when some service, such as a specific type of surgery, can't be provided at a VA facility; when a VA facility is geographically inaccessible; and when a delay in care would cause life-threatening complications.</p> \n<h3>The VA is not the same as the Military Health System or TRICARE</h3> \n<center><br></center> <center> \n<p><img alt=""53461577"" class=""photo"" src=""http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/assets/4543325/53461577.jpg""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Mark Wilson / Getty Images News</p> \n</center> \n<p>The VA's system is separate from the health-care system that the military uses for active-duty personnel, retirees, dependents, and military families.</p> \n<p>The military, instead, operates <a href=""http://www.health.mil/"">the Military Health System</a>. This system, <a href=""http://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2014/05/30/317381276/va-and-military-health-care-are-separate-yet-often-confused"">as NPR explained</a>, is made up of 57 hospitals, 400 clinics, and various operations in combat theaters, bases, and ships. The system prioritizes active-duty personnel, but, when available, it can also provide care to retirees, dependents, and former spouses.</p> \n<p>The military also offers a health insurance plan called <a href=""http://www.tricare.mil/allowablecharges/"">TRICARE</a> for active-duty personnel, retirees, dependents, and military families. TRICARE is very similar to Medicare, and its allowable charges are even <a href=""http://www.tricare.mil/allowablecharges/"">equal and pegged</a> to Medicare's. This insurance scheme lets active-duty personnel, retirees, dependents, and military families get private care when a military facility isn't readily available.</p> \n<h3>The VA's health-care providers are incentivized with pay bonuses to provide care in a timely manner</h3> \n<p>The VA's health-care system generally aims to see patients within 14 days of a requested date for appointment. If providers meet these goals, they can get bonuses totaling as much as <a href=""http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/05/12/did-the-va-pay-out-bonuses-for-screwing-veterans.html"">thousands of dollars</a>. Congress originally established these bonuses as a way to encourage accountability at local VA hospitals.</p> \n<p><q class=""right"" aria-hidden=""true"">this perverse incentive gets to the heart of the VA scandal</q></p> \n<p>But this incentive, which some critics are now calling perverse, gets to the heart of the <a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/va-scandal-explained/"">VA scandal</a>: it provides one possible explanation as to why administrators, particularly those at the Phoenix, Arizona, VA system, might have felt the need to cook the books to look like they were seeing patients in a timely manner.</p> \n<p>One problem, as the Government Accountability Office <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/5/30/5764762/sorry-mr-president-weve-known-about-the-vas-scheduling-problems-for"">previously explained</a>, is there's very little federal oversight to make sure VA offices are actually meeting scheduling policies. That creates an environment in which it's very easy for a local VA official to manipulate records to make it seem like the hospital is seeing patients in a timely manner when patients might not be getting care for <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/5/28/5758154/report-veterans-in-phoenix-wait-115-days-for-health-care"">115 days</a>.</p> \n<p>That doesn't, of course, in any way justify what Phoenix VA officials did. But it is something that the federal government might want to consider when establishing pay-for-performance schemes in the future.</p> \n<h3>Further reading<br>\n</h3> \n<ul> \n<li> <a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/va-scandal-explained/"">The VA scandal, explained</a><a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/va-scandal-explained/""><br></a> </li> \n<li><a href=""http://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2014/05/30/317381276/va-and-military-health-care-are-separate-yet-often-confused"">VA and military health care are separate, yet often confused</a></li> \n<li><a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/5/30/5762482/health-incentives-gone-wrong"">Screwed-up bonus payments are at the heart of the VA scandal</a></li> \n<li><a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/30/us/doctor-shortages-cited-in-va-hospital-waits.html"">Doctor shortage is cited in delays at VA hospitals</a></li> \n<li><a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/5/30/5764762/sorry-mr-president-weve-known-about-the-vas-scheduling-problems-for"">Sorry, Mr. President.

""With considerable regret, I accepted.""</p> \n<p>The decision is the Obama administration's most decisive action yet since the scandal broke at the Phoenix VA hospital. There, VA officials are accused of lying about wait times — to make it seem like they were seeing veteran patients in a timely manner. The inspector general's investigation <a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/va-scandal-explained/what-did-the-inspector-generals-investigation-find"">confirmed</a> some of the accusations and said the problems were, in fact, systemic.</p> \n<p>Sloan Gibson, the VA's deputy secretary, will replace Shinseki as acting secretary until a permanent replacement is found. The White House also said it will keep a top aide, Robert Nabors, at the VA as investigations continue.</p> \n<p>""Reforms should not wait,"" Obama said. ""They should proceed immediately.""</p> \n<p>Some of those reforms could include new scheduling technologies at VA facilities: Obama, while speaking to press, referenced scheduling systems that rely on technology from the 1990s.</p> \n<p>But the outdated technology doesn't explain the actions of Phoenix VA  officials. Outdated systems shouldn't necessarily influence whether someone is  willing to lie about seeing patients in an timely manner.</p> \n<p>The technology problems were also known and reported by the Government Accountability Office for years, including recent <a href=""http://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-13-130"">2013</a> and <a href=""http://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-14-509T"">2014</a> reports.</p> \n<p>Obama explained that Shinseki offered his resignation to avoid providing a political distraction as the scandal and investigations continued.</p> \n<p>""He is a very good man,"" Obama said. ""He's done exemplary work on our behalf. Under his leadership, we have seen more progress on more fronts at the VA — and a bigger investment at the VA — than just about any other VA secretary.""</p> \n<p>Obama's announcement came a couple hours after Shinseki said he will fire leaders at the Phoenix VA hospital and hold bonuses for all executive VA officials. The move, however, was not enough to silence critics, including <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/5/30/5762304/eric-shinseki-deserves-to-be-fired-for-the-va-scandal"">Vox's Matt Yglesias</a> and <a href=""http://www.nationaljournal.com/congress/here-are-the-members-of-congress-who-want-eric-shinseki-gone-20140529"">Democratic and Republican lawmakers</a>, who have been calling for Shinseki's resignation.</p> \n<p><b>Update</b>: This story was updated with the latest developments.</p>"

""This was not something that we were hearing when I  was traveling around the country — the particular issue of scheduling.""</p> \n<p>This statement is a puzzle on its own. The Government Accountability Office has been pointing to scheduling problems at the VA for years. Debra Draper, the health-care director at the GAO, has even <a href=""http://www.gao.gov/assets/660/652795.pdf"">testified</a> in front of Congress about the problems.</p> \n<p>Here are three of those problems, which were all referenced in <a href=""http://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-13-130"">2013</a> and <a href=""http://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-14-509T"">2014</a> reports from the GAO.</p> \n<h3>1) The federal government does a terrible job overseeing local VA facilities</h3> \n<p>More than anything, the GAO has repeatedly emphasized that the federal government does a terrible job watching over local VA facilities.</p> \n<p><q class=""right"" aria-hidden=""true"">""VHA's central office does not penalize noncompliance with the certification and expects oversight to be managed locally""</q></p> \n<p>One example: three of four clinics reviewed by the GAO certified  themselves within compliance of scheduling policies, but none of them actually were. While the VA could, in theory, audit and punish these facilities, the GAO found that the administration rarely does.</p> \n<p>""According to officials, [the Veteran Health Administration]'s central office does not penalize noncompliance with the certification and expects oversight to be managed locally,"" <a href=""http://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-13-130"">the 2013 report</a> found.</p> \n<p>This, more than any other GAO finding, speaks to <a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/va-scandal-explained/what-went-wrong-at-the-va"">what went wrong at the VA</a>. VA officials who hid long patient wait times are culpable for their own greed — they could get pay bonuses from the VA for shorter wait times — and mismanagement. But these problems could also have been caught earlier if the federal government actually checked on these facilities.</p> \n<h3>2) The VA's scheduling technology is severely outdated<br>\n</h3> \n<center> \n<p><img alt=""84184963_1_"" class=""photo"" src=""http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/assets/4493749/84184963_1_.jpg""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">President Obama and Rob Nabors. Mandel Ngan / AFP via Getty Images</p> \n</center> \n<p>President Obama said he will keep top White House aide Robert Nabors at the VA to continue investigating what went wrong. One of Nabors's discoveries so far, according to the president, is that the scheduling technology at the VA is decades old.</p> \n<p><q class=""right"" aria-hidden=""true"">this was yet another issue prominently covered by the GAO</q></p> \n<p>""I just was talking to Rob Nabors, and he described to me … how in some of these facilities you've  got computer systems for scheduling that date back to the '90s,"" Obama said.</p> \n<p>But this was yet another issue prominently covered by the GAO.</p> \n<p>""As we reported in May 2010, the VistA scheduling system is more than 25 years old and inefficient in facilitating care coordination between different sites,"" <a href=""http://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-13-130"">the 2013 report</a> stated. ""In 2000, [the Veterans Health Administration] began an initiative to modernize the scheduling system, but VA terminated the project in 2009. We also reported that VA's efforts to successfully replace the scheduling system were hindered by weaknesses in its project management processes and lack of effective oversight.""</p> \n<h3>3) The scheduling policies themselves are really vague<br>\n</h3> \n<p>Even if local VA officials decided to follow policies set at the federal level, that could come with a major problem: even the GAO isn't sure what the VA's scheduling policy intends.</p> \n<p><q class=""right"" aria-hidden=""true"">Maybe if the Obama administration was more aware of these reports, these fixes could have been implemented more quickly</q></p> \n<p>One example is the over-complicated way the VA schedules appointments: it allows both the patient and physician to choose a desired date, with little guidance as to which date should take precedence.</p> \n<p>""[Veterans Health Administration] central office officials responsible for developing VHA's scheduling policy and related training documents told us that the desired date is intentionally broad to account for all of the scheduling scenarios that may exist,"" <a href=""http://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-13-130"">the 2013 report</a> stated. ""However, leadership officials from the four [VA Medical Centers] we visited and their corresponding [Veteran Integrated Service Networks] reported problems with the unclear guidance on the desired date definition, and difficulties achieving consistent and correct use of the desired date by their schedulers.""</p> \n<p>Worse yet, training, which is supposed to be mandatory, is so loosely facilitated that schedulers might never get official guidance about the best practices even from their local bosses.</p> \n<p>""[VA Medical Center] officials stressed the importance of scheduler training for ensuring correct implementation of [Veterans Health Administration]'s scheduling policy; however, certain [VA Medical Centers] did not ensure completion of the training by all staff who were required to complete it,"" according to <a href=""http://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-13-130"">the 2013 report</a>.</p> \n<p>The VA, for its part, has shown some awareness of these scheduling problems, and it's agreed to implement some solutions suggested by the GAO. But in <a href=""http://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-14-509T"">a follow-up report</a> the GAO found the agency has spent more time in the past few years looking into how to implement the policies instead of actually implementing them.</p> \n<p>Maybe if the Obama administration was more aware of these reports, these fixes could have been implemented more quickly.</p>"
11 things most people don't know about health insurance,http://www.vox.com/2014/6/2/5765472/11-things-most-people-dont-know-about-health-insurance,Obamacare is going to extend coverage to millions of previously uninsured individuals. Here's what you should know about that.,"<p><span>Expanding health insurance is a fundamental goal of Obamacare, but a lot of misconceptions remain about what health insurance does and does not do. Giving someone a card that helps them pay for health care can have a lot of positive effects — but there are limits to the problems that insurance can solve, and there are less desirable consequences, too.</span></p> \n<h3><span>1. Insurance will increase the use of effective, appropriate health care</span></h3> \n<p>When people have health insurance, financial barriers to receiving health care are lifted and they <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18815523"">increase</a> use of services, which can be a great thing — diseases caught early can be better managed and treated. With insurance, <span>people are able to afford health screenings and prescription drugs that otherwise may have otherwise been unaffordable. </span></p> \n<h3>2. It will also increase the use of services that don't make people healthier</h3> \n<p>A lot of what we know about health insurance comes from the <a href=""http://theincidentaleconomist.com/wordpress/healthcare-triage-rand-and-the-moral-hazard/"">RAND health insurance experiment</a>, an experiment from the 1970s where people were randomly assigned health coverage that required different levels of out-of-pocket spending. People with more generous insurance — which meant they were on the hook for less of the cost themselves — consumed more health care, but it was greater use of <i>both </i>""valuable"" and ""wasteful"" care.</p> \n<h3>3. Insurance doesn't reduce emergency room use. It increases it.</h3> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""right"">INDIVIDUALS WHO USE THE EMERGENCY ROOM INAPPROPRIATELY OFTEN ATTACH A HIGH ""TIME COST"" TO REGULAR CHECK-UPS.</q></p> \n<p>When people have fewer barriers to the emergency room, they will visit it more often. This means more ""inappropriate"" use of the ER, too — going there for problems that aren't actually emergencies and are better handled through a typical doctor's appointment.</p> \n<p>This trend could be stronger among people who face barriers to health care other than affordability. A study published in Health Affairs <a href=""http://theincidentaleconomist.com/wordpress/the-latest-results-from-oregon-arent-actually-very-counterintuitive/"">found</a> that low-income individuals who use the emergency room inappropriately often attach a high ""time cost"" to regular doctor check-ups. In other words: it was more difficult for them to arrange time away from work, child care, transportation, and the like. Some people also believe that they can receive higher-quality care in the emergency room than from a primary care doctor.</p> \n<h3>4. There are social determinants of health that insurance alone can't influence</h3> \n<p>Health insurance makes medical care more affordable, but doctor trips are hardly the only factor that can influences outcomes. <a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/socialdeterminants/"">Social determinants of health</a>, defined by the CDC as ""the circumstances in which people are born, grow up, live, work, and age,""<b> </b>also play a huge — albeit less clearly understood — role in health.</p> \n<p><span></span>Health insurance does little to change those circumstances. To move the needle on social determinants of health, we should look to social services like education, child care, and cash and food assistance.</p> \n<p>The chart below is adapted from a <a style=""line-height: 1.5; background-color: #ffffff;"" href=""http://academyhealth.org/files/2013/sunday/bradley.pdf"">presentation</a> by Elizabeth Bradley, a professor at Yale's School of Public Health. Other developed countries actively invest in social services, spending nearly twice as much on those relative to direct health care. The United States inverts that ratio; for every dollar spent on health care, we only spend 56 cents on social programs.</p> \n<h3></h3> \n<p style=""font-family: 'Alright Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 15.555556297302246px; line-height: 25px;""><img alt=""Healthcareparadox"" class=""photo"" src=""http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/assets/4544659/healthcareparadox.png""></p> \n<h3>5. Still, health insurance reduces catastrophic medical expenditures</h3> \n<p>There's a pretty broad consensus that health insurance alleviates financial hardship from catastrophic medical expenditures. The best evidence to date on this is from an expansion of Medicaid in Oregon, where Medicaid enrollment was allocated to certain low-income individuals through a lottery. This created conditions that mimicked a randomized controlled trial, the gold standard in research.</p> \n<p><q class=""right"" aria-hidden=""true"">MEDICAID ENROLLEES WERE 80 PERCENT LESS LIKELY THAN THE UNINSURED TO REPORT CATASTROPHIC MEDICAL EXPENSES.</q></p> \n<p>One year after receiving coverage, Oregon's Medicaid recipients were <a href=""http://theincidentaleconomist.com/wordpress/oregon-health-study-results-part-1/"">40 percent</a> less likely to need to borrow money or skip payments on other bills to afford medical care, compared to the uninsured control group. At two years out, the Medicaid enrollees were <a href=""http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMsa1212321"">80 percent</a> less likely than the uninsured to report catastrophic medical expenses.</p> \n<p>Whether insurance actually puts a dent in medical <i>bankruptcies</i> is <a href=""http://theincidentaleconomist.com/wordpress/where-we-stand-divided-on-medical-bankruptcy/"">tough to say</a>. For example, one <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21396505"">study</a> found that rates of medical bankruptcy didn't decline following Massachusetts's 2006 health reform, as we might expect, but the recession may have confounded the study's findings.</p> \n<h3>6. People with health insurance report better mental and physical health</h3> \n<p>A <a href=""http://kinder.rice.edu/content.aspx?id=2147485278&amp;blogid=306"">recent survey</a> from Rice University found that people with health insurance are consistently more likely to report better health, regardless of income, education, age, and ethnic background. Half of people with health insurance said their health was ""excellent"" or ""very good""; only 35 percent of uninsured respondents reported the same.</p> \n<p>That association between insurance and reported health status isn't enough to suggest a causal relationship. Findings from Oregon's Medicaid expansion are: those who were randomized to Medicaid coverage were significantly more likely to report better physical health <a href=""http://theincidentaleconomist.com/wordpress/oregon-health-study-results-part-1/"">one</a> and <a href=""http://theincidentaleconomist.com/wordpress/oregon-and-medicaid-and-evidence-and-chill-people/"">two</a> years after receiving coverage.The Medicaid enrollees also reported substantially better <a href=""http://projectmillennial.org/2013/05/15/so-medicaid-improved-depression-in-oregon-what-else-can-we-say-about-that/"">mental health</a> compared to those who didn't receive coverage.</p> \n<h3>7. Recent research strongly suggests that insurance saves lives</h3> \n<p>Following the introduction of Romneycare, mortality in Massachusetts <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/5/6/5684928/study-romneycare-saved-hundreds-of-lives"">fell 2.9 percent</a> relative to similar counties in other states. This suggests that for every 830 people insured, one death is prevented. <span>""In the hierarchy of evidence, this ranks way above everything we've seen in the past in terms of the effects on mortality,"" David Meltzer, a health economist at the University of Chicago, told the </span><a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/06/health/death-rate-fell-in-massachusetts-after-health-care-overhaul.html"" style=""line-height: 1.5; background-color: #ffffff;"">New York Times</a><span>. Meltzer is the co-author of a </span><a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18031224"" style=""line-height: 1.5; background-color: #ffffff;"">widely-cited meta-analysis</a><span> on the effects of health insurance on health.</span></p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""center"">""IN THE HIERARCHY OF EVIDENCE, THIS RANKS WAY ABOVE EVERYTHING WE'VE SEEN IN THE PAST""</q></p> \n<p>This is also evidence of insurance having a <a href=""http://theincidentaleconomist.com/wordpress/health-insurance-saves-lives-that-means-it-improves-health-too/"">positive impact on health</a>. An insurance card cannot reduce death all by itself; diseases have to be better treated, managed, or prevented first.</p> \n<h3>8. But insurance doesn't guarantee high-quality care</h3> \n<p><span>As Amitabh Chandra and Katherine Baicker write in </span><a style=""font-family: 'Alright Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 15.555556297302246px; line-height: 1.5; background-color: #ffffff;"" href=""http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/27/6/w533.full.pdf"">Health Affairs</a><span>, ""The likelihood of getting high-quality care has more to do with geography than with insurance status or spending."" </span></p> \n<p>There is an extensive amount of research documenting variation in the quality of care received by Medicare beneficiaries — who are, by definition, all insured. A lot of this variation is geographic in nature, suggestion that there are regional patterns in how medicine is practiced, and some regions provide better care than others.</p> \n<h3>9. <span>And insurance won't solve all access problems</span>\n</h3> \n<p>Health insurance goes a long way toward making health care more <i>affordable</i>, but <span>""access"" to health care goes way beyond whether or not a person can afford to visit the doctor.</span></p> \n<p><q class=""right"" aria-hidden=""true"">""ACCESS"" GOES WAY BEYOND WHETHER OR NOT A PERSON CAN AFFORD TO VISIT THE DOCTOR.</q></p> \n<p>The nation is short on doctors, and the doctors we do have tend to <a href=""http://health.newamerica.net/blogposts/2011/disagreements_with_people_we_respect_matt_yglesias_edition-60348"">concentrate</a> in areas that already have high physician capacity; not coincidentally. Regions classified as ""<a href=""http://hpsafind.hrsa.gov/"">health provider shortage areas</a>"" are going to face particular strain when coverage rates increase and more people try to schedule medical appointments.</p> \n<p>There are also temporal, geographic, and cultural barriers to care. When physicians keep 9 to 5 hours, working adults might struggle to fit an appointment into their schedule. Geographic accessibility can be a hindrance, particularly in rural regions or where an individual doesn't have access to reliable transportation. And, for some patients, cultural factors influence the relative ""acceptability"" of a provider.</p> \n<h3><span>10. Getting everyone insured won't rein in health spending</span></h3> \n<p><span></span>Insurance can't solve a problem that's incredibly fundamental to our health spending problems: spending is distributed across different patients in a radically unequal fashion. About 5 percent of patients are responsible for half of all health spending. Meanwhile, the cheapest 50 percent of patients account for less than 3 percent of spending.</p> \n<p>Here's what that looks like as a chart:</p> \n<p style=""font-family: 'Alright Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 15.555556297302246px; line-height: 25px;""><img src=""http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/assets/4544327/nihcm-healthspending.png"" class=""photo"" alt=""Nihcm-healthspending""></p> \n<p style=""font-family: 'Alright Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 15.555556297302246px; line-height: 25px;"">Expanding coverage isn't likely to change <a href=""http://www.nihcm.org/images/stories/DataBrief3_Final.pdf"">this distribution</a>. Other health reforms — changing how we pay for care, not just who we cover — hold much more promise.</p> \n<h3>11. But we needed to increase insurance coverage before we tried to restrain health spending</h3> \n<p>Obamacare's primary objective is to extend affordable coverage to millions of people for whom insurance was out of financial reach. It has some elements intended to contain cost growth, too — <a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/how-doctors-are-paid/what-are-accountable-care-organizations"">accountable care organizations</a>, the <a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/obamacare/what-is-the-ipab"">Independent Payment Advisory Board</a>, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation — but the bulk of the law concerns itself with expanding coverage.</p> \n<p>This is by design.</p> \n<p>Back in 2010, health economist Len Nichols authored a thoughtful <a href=""http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp1001604"">editorial</a> on the logic behind this move:</p> \n<blockquote>Fiscal hawks will still ask why we can't contain cost growth first and expand coverage later. This is a fair question — although the Congressional Budget Office has determined that both the House and Senate health care bills reduce the deficit, and a choice that forces the growing number of uninsured to wait another decade would, in my view, be immoral. Nevertheless, the simple answer to the hawks' question is that it is not feasible to tackle costs without tackling coverage. Our delivery system could not withstand the stress. Two thirds of hospitals lose money on Medicare now. Virtually all lose money because of Medicaid underpayment. To impose serious delivery reform and incentive realignment while leaving hospitals on the hook for the mounting billions of dollars in uncompensated care would bankrupt many and strain most to the breaking point. With expanded coverage, we'll get absolutely essential hospital cooperation. Without expanded coverage, hospitals will have to protect themselves from change, and their local communities will want them to.</blockquote> \n<h3><span>The bottom line? </span></h3> \n<p><span></span><span>Health insurance matters. Achieving near-universal coverage — which Obamacare aims to do — won't solve the problems that plague the nation's health and health care system, but it's an important step in that direction and sets the stage for further health reform. </span></p>"

The VA gave bonus payments for seeing patients in a timely manner. But when<span> local VA officials realized they couldn't meet the goal, they manipulated the electronic data reported to the VA to hide patients who weren't being seen so quickly.<br></span></p> \n<p>The audit evaluated 138 of the more than 150 VA hospitals nationwide. The rest of the VA's expansive network will be audited in the second phase of the investigations.</p> \n<p>In the meantime, the VA said it will reevaluate its policies to move  away from a system that was clearly unrealistic in the first place.</p>"
Think Obamacare helped you? You're probably a Democrat,http://www.vox.com/2014/6/2/5768464/think-obamacare-helped-you-youre-probably-a-democrat,"Democrats likely overestimate the health law's reach, Republicans underestimate and the truth is probably somewhere in the middle.","<p><span>Republicans are five times less likely to say they've been helped by Obamacare than Democrats — and about half as likely to know someone who has gained coverage through the law.</span></p> \n<p>Those are some of the key findings from <a href=""http://kff.org/health-reform/poll-finding/kaiser-health-tracking-poll-may-2014/"">the newest Kaiser Family Foundation poll</a>. They could suggest that Democrats really are way more likely to get help from Obamacare — and know way more people getting help, too.</p> \n<p>But there's a simpler, and arguably more plausible explanation of the new data. Political views deeply color impressions of whether the Affordable Care Act is working — or is a miserable failure. Democrats likely overestimate the health law's reach, Republicans underestimate and the truth is probably somewhere in the middle.</p> \n<p>There are two questions in the new Kaiser poll that show huge differences between how many people Democrats and Republicans think the health care law is helping. The first was about whether individuals themselves had been helped by the Affordable Care Act. More than a quarter of Democrats said yes, they'd been helped, while the number was 5 percent among Republicans.</p> \n<div style=""text-align:center""> \n<p><img src=""http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/assets/4542457/kff1.png"" class=""photo"" alt=""Kff1""></p> \n</div> \n<p>The second question asked whether respondents knew someone else who had been helped by the Affordable Care Act. Again, there was a big disparity between what Republicans and Democrats saw happening with the people they know.</p> \n<div style=""text-align:center""> \n<p><img alt=""Kff2"" class=""photo"" src=""http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/assets/4542469/kff2.png""></p> \n</div> \n<p>Republicans, meanwhile, were more likely to say they knew someone who lost their health coverage, or had their hours cut because of Obamacare.</p> \n<p>There could be some reasons why Democrats know more people who have benefited from Obamacare. Democratic governors, for example, have been more likely to expand the Medicaid program, meaning voters there would have access to a part of the health care law that isn't available in some Repubican-run states.</p> \n<p>But its unlikely that would account for the huge disparities in perceptions of how the health care law is going. Instead, they seem to reflect the more basic fact of whether people like Obamacare or hate it.</p>"

The first is pretty straightforward — access to insurance could make kids healthier and healthier kids could do better in school. But there's also a potential indirect effect — giving families health insurance could increase the financial resources they have available for non-health expenses, and <i>that</i> could help kids do well in school.

The White House delayed the employer mandate by one year, citing administrative difficulties in setting up the new regulation. In the interim, there's been a growing debate over whether the employer mandate makes sense as a policy, and if it might be doing more harm than good.</span></p> \n<p>The left-leaning Urban Institute put out<a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/5/10/5700536/should-obamacare-let-employers-not-provide-insurance""> a paper </a>last month, making the case that killing the employer mandate would reduce insurance coverage by a tiny 0.07 percent. And earlier today, a relatively prominent Obamacare supporter wrote <a href=""http://healthaffairs.org/blog/2014/06/04/repeal-and-replace-the-employer-mandate/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=repeal-and-replace-the-employer-mandate"">a lengthy piece</a> for the journal <i>Health Affairs </i>advocating for scraping the provision.</p> \n<p><q class=""center"" aria-hidden=""true"">the white house's 'action in implementing the employer mandate seems to be a cry for help'</q></p> \n<p>Washington &amp; Lee University Law Professor Timothy Jost does, however, have a slightly different take on the issue: he thinks Congress should replace the current employer mandate with<a href=""http://www.healthaffairs.org/healthpolicybriefs/brief_pdfs/healthpolicybrief_15.pdf""> the version from the House version</a> of health reform. That would require companies to devote a certain percent of their payroll to health benefits, rather than tethering fines to each worker.</p> \n<p>Jost and I spoke Wednesday morning about why he would like to see the employer mandate scrapped, what's been learned from its implementation and what a replacement could look like.</p> \n<p><b>Sarah Kliff: How has your thinking evolved on the employer mandate, to the point of writing this piece in Health Affairs today?</b></p> \n<p>Timothy Jost: I've been following the implementation regulations all along. One thing that has struck me over and over again is how incredibly complicated the employer mandate is. The reporting requirements, the determining who is a large employer, who is small, who is full time and part time is all a pretty burdensome operation And I think the Urban Institute paper really raises the question of is it worth the effort? What are we getting out of all the time and resources being invested in this?</p> \n<p><b>SK: Was it clear that the employer mandate would be a mess when it was passed as part of Obamacare? Or is it something that has become more apparent with implementation?</b></p> \n<div class=""align-right""></div> \n<p><q class=""right"" aria-hidden=""true"">'one thing that has struck me again and again is how incredibly complicated the employer mandate is'</q></p> \n<p>TJ: It looked pretty complicated to begin with. It's become clearer and clearer over time that its a heavy lift, I'd say.</p> \n<p>One thing that I think has become clear, and don't think it was clear to many people at first, is how little it actually gets you because of the skinny benefits that employers<a href=""http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702303754404579312760133827256""> can continue to offer </a>and still be considered to fulfill the mandate.</p> \n<p>Then there's also the<a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/post/health-reforms-50-billion-question-whats-affordable/2011/08/02/gIQAJijEJJ_blog.html""> family glitch,</a> where  you have the possibility of companies offering insurance to the individual, and not the family, but still counted as fulfilling the mandate. That, in my view, was a misinterepation of the law. But either way, I think there's a whole series of issues here that could be improved by simply getting rid of the employer mandate and replacing it with an easier to administer version result.</p> \n<p><b>SK: Walk me through the House proposal that you think we should be using instead.</b></p> \n<p>TJ: It would require companies, as I understand it, to spend 8 percent of their payroll on health benefits.  For smaller companies, it would be a smaller percentage. It was a graduated thing, that if your payroll was under a half million dollars, or some benchmark, you would pay a smaller percentage.</p> \n<p>I don’t know if that’s the right percent. But it's just a much simpler thing to administer with some very basic requirements. And it would get rid of the problem of people trying to evade the regulations.</p> \n<p>It also works out so the amount of revenue generated was estimated at the time to be $135 million [which is similar to revenue generated by the current policy].</p> \n<p><b>SK: Why do you think we need a replacement? You mentioned Urban Institute's research, for example, which suggests that there would be a very small impact of coverage if the employer mandate repealed without another policy put in place.</b></p> \n<p>TJ: I think my conclusion is a bit different than Urban's. I don't think that's a good idea because the employer mandate does in fact get us some things. It will increase the number of people covered and generates a huge amount of revenue. I don't think we should just repeal it, but we should be looking for alternatives that could accomplish more or less the same result without imposing anything like the same burden.</p> \n<p>It's also worth pointing out that Urban's estimates are slightly different than the CBO. Urban estimated the number of uninsured would increase by about 200,000 without the employer mandate. CBO projected about 500,000 to 1 million. A million is a much bigger number.</p> \n<p><span>Their estimate of lost revenue [from repealing the employer mandate] was $46 </span><span>billion, but</span><span> the CBO has estimated $130 billion and Rand said $150 billion. If Urban is right, then repeal on its own might be a </span><span>possibility. But</span><span> still, even $46 billion is a </span><span>significant</span><span> amount of money. If that had to come out of some other place that could be a real problem. </span></p> \n<p><b>SK: Is this a policy the White House could accomplish on its own, or do they need Congress to pass something?</b></p> \n<p>TJ: Congress would have to take action. I should say, I have not discussed this with anyone in the administration and do not have any reason to have any reason to believe the official position of the administration.</p> \n<p>At the same time, their action in implementing the employer mandate seems to be a cry for help. They realize this is a real heavy lift and are looking for how to do it in a responsible way. It would be to their advantage to have this part of the ACA working, and not have this be a distraction.</p>"

Public health plans, such as Medicaid and those for public employees, would also be barred from covering the birth control pill and contraceptives that Republicans claim prevent the implantation of a fertilized egg, including IUDs. (Republicans' claims about IUDs, however, are <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/17/health/religious-groups-equate-some-contraceptives-with-abortion.html"">very much disputed</a> by some scientists and health experts.)</p> \n<p>State Rep. John Becker, the bill's sponsor, says it wasn't his intent to prevent coverage for birth control pills, and the bill could be amended to exempt the pill. But Becker said he supports an IUD ban because preventing the implantation of a fertilized egg is comparable to an abortion.</p> \n<p>""This is just a personal view. I'm not a medical doctor,"" Becker said.</p> \n<p>The bill, in other words, attempts to stop women, particularly low-income women, from using <a href=""http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/fb_contr_use.html"">one of the most effective, practical forms of birth control</a>.</p> \n<center> \n<p><img src=""http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/assets/4564019/contraceptive_effectiveness.png"" class=""photo"" alt=""Contraceptive_effectiveness""></p> \n</center> \n<p>The only exemption in the bill is for ectopic pregnancies, which could threaten the life of the mother. Pregnancies involving rape, incest, and other life-threatening circumstances would not be exempted.</p> \n<p>Becker's bill isn't the first time Ohio's Republican-controlled legislature has moved to restrict abortions. In <a href=""http://citybeat.com/cincinnati/article-28085-bad_news_budget.html"">the latest state budget</a>, Republicans approved a slew of measures that will, among other things, allow state officials to more easily shut down abortion clinics.</p> \n<p>Ohio Republicans aren't alone.

Under Obamacare, most insurers are <a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/obamacare-and-contraceptives/what-does-obamacare-have-to-do-with-birth-control"">required to cover birth control</a> with no cost-sharing for members.

And it seems to be especially strong in some non-expansion states. For example, South Carolina, which has not expanded its Medicaid program, has seen enrollment rise by 14.4 percent anyway.

So this is not in my mind about whether this is theoretically possible.""</p> \n<h3>Performance incentives could be more focused</h3> \n<p>The <a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/va-scandal-explained/what-went-wrong-at-the-va"">VA scandal</a> can, in short, be described as <a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/va-scandal-explained/how-did-the-va-go-so-wrong-in-the-first-place"">an issue of perverse incentives</a>: The <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/5/30/5765924/audit-the-vas-poor-policies-created-perverse-incentives"">unrealistic goals and metrics</a> set by federal overseers led local VA officials to manipulate and falsify waiting lists to obtain financial bonuses for seeing patients quickly.</p> \n<div class=""align-right""> \n<p><img src=""http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/assets/4570821/488810805.jpg"" class=""photo"" alt=""488810805""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Christian Petersen / Getty Images News</p> \n</div> \n<p>Part of the problem, experts like Jha argue, is that the VA's bad scheduling system shouldn't exist in the first place.</p> \n<p>Jha argues it's time for the VA to step back and find the big health measures it wants to focus on, instead of trying to rely on so many complicated metrics all at once. <span>He says the scheduling system in particular could be simplified to follow </span>the simpler<span> priority system used in private </span>care<span>: Instead of trying to arbitrarily jam patients into an unrealistic 14-day window for appointments, the VA should acknowledge each patient's needs and schedule them accordingly. </span></p> \n<p>""There's almost no other entity that I know of that tries to measure waiting times like this,"" Jha explains. ""When you are acutely ill or feeling suicidal, 14 days is an insane amount of time to have to wait. If you are chronically ill but pretty stable, if you have to wait 40 days for the next appointment, … that's not a big deal.""</p> \n<p>It's worth noting, as well, that falsifying medical records is much more difficult than the waiting lists the VA used for scheduling. So moving to standard health metrics could help prevent fraud.</p> \n<p>Just refocusing the measures, however, might not be enough. As <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/5/30/5764762/sorry-mr-president-weve-known-about-the-vas-scheduling-problems-for"">previous GAO reports</a> found, part of the problem with the VA is that federal oversight over the current policies and metrics is too lax. So if the measures are reformed, federal overseers are also going to need to pay closer attention to make sure the standards are being followed.</p> \n<h3>More transparency and humility could lead to better scrutiny</h3> \n<p>More transparency at the VA could open the agency to more — and perhaps better — scrutiny.</p> \n<p>To accomplish this, the VA could take greater part in performance-reporting initiatives and expand learning-and-improvement partnerships with outside entities.</p> \n<div class=""align-right""> \n<p><img src=""http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/assets/4570805/1316395.jpg"" class=""photo"" alt=""1316395"" height=""170"" width=""243""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Getty Images</p> \n</div> \n<p>The VA today only shares a limited amount of data through Hospital Compare, a public reporting program for hospital. It has also declined to participate in public performance reporting forums, like the program run by the Leapfrog Group.</p> \n<p>Sharing these metrics, whether with the public or through medical partnerships, could give lawmakers and experts a better idea of what needs to be fixed within the VA. It's difficult, after all, to suggest fixes when the exact problem is unclear.</p> \n<p>How the VA approaches scrutiny could also play a role. In the past few years, VA officials have exuded confidence about the government-run health-care system. Some of that is earned: VA health care dramatically improved after the 1990s, and its health outcomes <a href=""http://www.hsrd.research.va.gov/publications/esp/quality.pdf"">compare to or outperform</a> private care. But the good news also fostered what Jha describes as a culture of overconfidence.</p> \n<p>""I think it is unhelpful. It's the wrong way to look at the world,"" Jha says. ""Once you've decided you're the best care anywhere, you don't have any reason to improve.""</p> \n<h3>The VA could step up its recruitment</h3> \n<p>There's wide agreement that part of the VA's problem is rooted in a serious doctor shortage. The agency, <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/30/us/doctor-shortages-cited-in-va-hospital-waits.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss&amp;smid=tw-thecaucus"">The New York Times reports</a>, has struggled to fill 400 vacancies in its team of primary care doctors, which last year totaled 5,100.</p> \n<p>""It's not the case that the medical care is bad,"" Colin Moore, a political science professor at the University of Hawaii, says. ""It's that the demand is greater than the supply.""</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""right"">""It's not the case that the medical care is bad. It's that the demand is greater than the supply.""</q></p> \n<p>Unlike the other cited solutions, this one would likely require more funding. But it's necessary, Moore argues, to build capacity that is clearly lacking at the VA's medical facilities.</p> \n<p>As Moore puts it, the roots of the VA's doctor shortage are two-fold: One, physicians can get paid as little as half of what they could make in a private practice. Two, the VA isn't aggressive enough in its recruitment or in efforts to combat its stigma of bureaucracy.</p> \n<p>""Just look at how Kaiser Permanente recruits physicians, compared to how the VA does it. It doesn't appear as attractive,"" Moore says. ""But, actually, internal VA studies show physicians and other health-care providers are more willing to consider a career at the VA after they spend some time there.""</p> \n<p>Private health-care institutions aggressively seek out the best doctors. They offer competitive salaries, they train and send out full-time recruiters, they hold recruitment events, and they emphasize the potential gain in professional reputations that comes with working at, say, Kaiser Permanante or the Cleveland Clinic.</p> \n<p>The VA engages in some of these practices, but it's much more constrained by the limits of a highly cost-conscious government.</p> \n<h3>More funding doesn't need to play a role, but it could</h3> \n<div class=""align-right""> \n<p><img src=""http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/assets/4570765/56801381.jpg"" class=""photo"" alt=""56801381""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">H. Armstrong Roberts / Retrofile via Getty Images</p> \n</div> \n<p>There's little denial that some of the VA's problems, such as higher physician salaries and outdated technology, will require more funding. But at least some of those costs, experts argue, could be offset by restructuring the system.</p> \n<p>As one example, Jha cites the massive administrative growth the VA has seen in the past couple decades: central-office health-care staff went from about 800 in the late 1990s to nearly 11,000 in 2012. Scaling back the explosive growth could open up resources that could then be allocated to solving some of the standing access problems.</p> \n<p>Still, the VA, at some point, might need to turn to Congress for additional help.  Even though the agency has gotten more funding over the past few years, the increases <a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/va-scandal-explained/has-funding-for-the-vas-health-care-services-increased-in-the-past"">haven't kept up</a> with overall growth in health costs.</p> \n<p>Given Congress's <a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/congressional-dysfunction/what-is-political-polarization"">dysfunctional state</a>, getting more money could prove to be a huge challenge. But this scandal might act as the right incentive.</p> \n<p>""If there's any silver lining to this, it's that … Congress now knows it needs to appropriate more money,"" Moore says.</p> \n<h3>Further reading</h3> \n<ul> \n<li><a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/va-scandal-explained/what-went-wrong-at-the-va"">The VA scandal, explained</a></li> \n<li><a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/6/1/5762710/a-simple-guide-to-how-va-health-care-works"">A simple guide to how VA health care works</a></li> \n<li><a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/5/30/5764762/sorry-mr-president-weve-known-about-the-vas-scheduling-problems-for"">Sorry, Mr. President.

They found the calorie-based tax would be superior, since it's a more precise measure of the amount of sugar in drinks. But such a measure could be more difficult to implement in practice because it involves a more sophisticated target.</p> \n<p>The tax, of course, doesn't mean Americans will drop their tasty drinks altogether: researchers found that the average person buys more than 21,000 in calories of such drinks each year, and the 5,800 reduction is about one-fourth of that. But it could push Americans to wean themselves off more sugary drinks, like Coke, and instead take up healthier sweet drinks that would be exempted from the tax, like 100-percent fruit juice.</p> \n<p>Still, there's a lot of room to question the political feasibility of such a tax. Although an abundance of sugar is one of the leading causes of America's obesity and health problems, measures restraining consumers' intake of sugar tend to be very unpopular. In New York City, former Mayor Michael Bloomberg's attempts to ban supersize versions of sodas have been met with <a href=""http://www.cbsnews.com/news/opinions-clash-during-new-york-city-soda-ban-public-hearing/"">public scorn</a> and even <a href=""http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/07/30/us-sodaban-lawsuit-idUSBRE96T0UT20130730"">legal challenges</a>.</p> \n<p>Health experts are so concerned with the problem that some are even calling for <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/6/2/5771008/the-case-for-treating-sugar-like-a-drug"">taxing and regulating sugar like a drug</a>. That might seem like an overreaction to many Americans, but pediatric endocrinologist Robert Lustig argued in <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/6/2/5771008/the-case-for-treating-sugar-like-a-drug"">a previous interview</a> that it's a necessary step due to sugar's saturation in food products and addictiveness. He claimed the idea could be sold to the public if the revenue was attached to the right policy, like, say, a significant subsidy on healthier foods.</p> \n<p>""Sugar is the alcohol of a child,"" Lustig said. ""You would never let a child drink a can  of Budweiser, but you would never think twice about a can of Coke. Yet  what it does to the liver, what it does to the arteries, what it does to  the heart is all the same.

The idea here is to incentivize insurers to take on sicker Medicare enrollees, ensuring that they don't avoid the seniors whose costly health conditions would otherwise make them a money loser.</p> \n<p>Incentive programs don't, however, always go as planned. And the CPI investigation suggests that some insurers gamed the risk score system. They would oversell how sick their patients were to get a higher payment. The CPI investigation cites a few specific examples of this type of behavior:</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>In South Florida, one of the nation's top privately-run Medicare insurance plans faces a federal investigation into allegations that it overbilled the government by exaggerating how sick some of its patients were.</p> \n<p>In the Las Vegas area, private health care plans for seniors ran up more than $100 million in added Medicare charges after asserting patients they signed up also were much sicker than normal - a claim many experts have challenged.</p> \n<p>In Rochester, New York, a Medicare plan was paid $41 million to treat people with serious diseases - even though the plan couldn't prove the patients in fact had those diseases.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>It's not known which insurers, exactly, are suspected of overbilling the federal government in this way. CPI says its asked the federal government for this information and that ""federal officials refused to identify health plans suspected of overcharging Medicare, citing agency policy that keeps many business records confidential."" CPI has filed <a href=""http://www.publicintegrity.org/2014/05/27/14805/center-sues-effort-make-medicare-advantage-files-public"">a lawsuit </a>to make this information public.</p> \n<p>The investigation could give Medicare Advantage plans a tougher time in its annual negotiations with the federal government over what rates it should be paid.

Can you expand on that?</b></p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""right"">""THE SYSTEM IS NOT GOOD AT PREVENTING HOSPITALIZATIONs WHEN IT'S CLEARLY POSSIBLE""</q></p> \n<p>David Cutler: Nobody denies that there's a lot of waste. Estimates range from 15 to 20 percent on the low end to 50 percent at the high end. There are a few different categories of waste.</p> \n<p>One is clinical waste, things that are done that don't need to be done. A very classic example of that is <span>people who are in and out of the hospital because you can't monitor them in between visits. It's not that the hospitalization itself is unnecessary — because the person <i>is</i> having a crisis — it's that the system is not good at preventing people from needing hospitalization when it's clearly possible to do that.</span></p> \n<p>Another kind of waste is something we call ""pricing failures."" This is the idea that we pay much more for medical services than is necessary. In the Boston area, the cost of an abdominal CT scan ranges from $300 to $1,300. It's not that the hospital with the $1,300 scan is better — it's often the same machine, similar doctors — it's that the place with the more expensive service has more power in the market.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""center"">""What we spend on administrative expenses is twice what we spend on heart disease and three times what we spend on cancer""</q></p> \n<p>The third kind of waste is administrative cost. What we spend on administrative expenses in the U.S. is twice what we spend on heart disease and three times what we spend on cancer. That's just absurd. Health care seems to be much less efficient than any other industry in getting rid of those administrative costs. <span> </span></p> \n<p>The fourth broad area is fraud and abuse. It's hard to know exactly how much, but it's a system where it's easy to imagine there is some fraudulent billing.</p> \n<p>Between all that, you get to enormous amounts of money.</p> \n<p><b>AM: Do you think this is very different from other nations? Are other nations better at getting better health care outcomes for their health care dollars? Are there particular kinds of waste that the U.S. is especially bad at? </b></p> \n<p>DC: Yes. Other countries deliver less care, because they have constraints on the total amount of technology available. For example, in all of Ontario there are 11 hospitals set up to do open-heart surgery; the government puts a limit on it. In Pennsylvania, which has roughly the same population and is much smaller geographically, there are 60 hospitals that can do open-heart surgery.</p> \n<p>That additional care doesn't seem to be doing much good. Survival after a heart attack is similar in the U.S. and Canada; most studies suggest that quality of life is similar, too. A lot of care seems to be provided in discretionary situations where it's not always necessary, nor is it doing very much.</p> \n<p><q class=""center"" aria-hidden=""true"">""A lot of care seems to be provided where it's not always necessary""</q></p> \n<p>Other countries also don't pay the high prices that the U.S. does. And administrative costs are much lower in other countries.</p> \n<p>That's not to say that other countries are perfect. When I'm asked which country is best, I say, ""Well, we have 25 examples of what not to emulate, and no examples of things to exactly emulate.<span> Saying other countries are more efficient doesn't mean we should strive to </span><i style=""line-height: 1.5;"">be </i><span>them, it just goes to show that it </span><i style=""line-height: 1.5;"">is </i><span>possible to do better.</span></p> \n<p><b>AM: I went back and read Roger Lowenstein's </b><a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/13/magazine/13HEALTH.html?_r=0"">New York Times article</a><b> that you borrow your book title from. One line that stood out to me was ""instead of worrying about the cost of health care, [we] should worry about the benefits.""

Can you talk a little about that?</b></p> \n<p>DC: The whole title, <i>The Quality Cure,</i> is about the fact that quality has to be front and center.</p> \n<p><q class=""right"" aria-hidden=""true"">""QUALITY HAS TO BE FRONT AND CENTER""</q></p> \n<p>If you ask people, ""Do you want to save money in health care?"" they'll say yes. If you ask, ""Do you want to save money in health care by giving up valuable services?"" they'll say no. And they're correct to say that! <span>It's easy to save money. It's hard to save it in a way that's right and in a way that works for people.</span></p> \n<p><span>What the book is about — and what I think is the single hardest challenge in American health care — is to figure out how to make the system work better so that our goal is not cutting costs; our goal is improving value. Eventually this will come with lower costs, but that will be a byproduct of actually doing better.</span></p> \n<p><b>AM: One of the challenges here is that we need to be able to define and measure quality before we can pay for ""value."" Where are we at with that now, and how much research still needs to be done before we can really push forward on that front? </b></p> \n<p><span>DC: I think we get hung up on saying that we don't understand value perfectly, and therefore we need to be careful about doing anything.</span></p> \n<p><span>There's enormous variation across doctors in the care they provide. Not just across the country, but doctors in the same office; one might order CT scans for head trauma ten or twenty times more frequently than the next. There's very little confronting providers and asking, ""Why do you practice this way instead of another way?""</span></p> \n<p><q class=""center"" aria-hidden=""true"">""THAT'S JUST GETTING RID OF THE OBVIOUS, BUT THE LOWEST-HANGING FRUIT IS A LOT OF MONEY""</q></p> \n<p><span>One of the very big steps that health systems can take is to look at that distribution and show the doctors that spread. </span><span>Then you say, ""Let's talk about it. What are you doing that's different?"" Almost invariably, those at the high end will agree that they're probably doing too much. </span></p> \n<p>That's just getting rid of the obvious, but <span>the lowest-hanging fruit is a lot of money. </span></p> \n<p>If you look at the poster children for bad care, like preventable readmissions, infections, and other hospital errors, there are very effective protocols that can be put in place. Hospitals have had enormous success with these.</p> \n<p>Well before we get into the question of ""Do I know exactly which treatment should be done exactly when for exactly whom?"" there's enough low-hanging fruit that we can make huge progress.</p> \n<p><b>AM: One of the other lines that stood out to me in your book is where you say ""Society cannot force change."" So, how do we motivate this change — change we've been talking about for decades, but that we've never actually realized? </b></p> \n<p>DC: People yell at me about that a lot. I remember when I advised Senator Obama when he was running for president the first time; people kept asking, ""What makes you think you'll be any more successful than the 25 people who came before you?""</p> \n<p><q class=""right"" aria-hidden=""true"">'YOU CAN NO LONGER ARGUE THAT WE CAN'T DO BETTER'</q></p> \n<p>Part of the answer is that it helps to be optimistic.</p> \n<p>One of the things that's different between the failed Clinton health reform and what happened in the Obama administration is that, in the interim, the Institute of Medicine published volumes saying that <span>costs were much higher than they need to be and outcomes were much poorer than they could be. It then became impossible to deny that.</span></p> \n<p>The argument on which many health reforms have faltered over time — that we're not sure what the right thing is because we're not sure how we compare to some optimal system — that argument got totally undercut. You can no longer argue that we can't do better.</p> \n<p><b>AM: You say in your book that you anticipate a lot of change in health care over the next few years. What's that going to look like? </b></p> \n<p>DC: All markets have two sides: they have the demand side and the supply side. The health care market is screwed up on both of them.</p> \n<p>So, on the demand side, we tell people to go out and be smart consumers of health care, only it's actually impossible to find out how much providers will charge you. Literally, if you call them, they can't tell you. We have to fix that.</p> \n<p>On the supply side, we have fee-for-service payment. We've told providers that we'll pay them more for doing more stuff — then we're surprised when they do more stuff!</p> \n<p>Fixing the supply-side problem is really about payment reform. As I see it, there's a substantial amount of agreement — including among people who don't like many features of the Affordable Care Act — that one of the worst features of health care is the way it goes about paying for things.</p> \n<p>Medicare has taken a halfway-step on payment reform with the <a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/how-doctors-are-paid/what-are-accountable-care-organizations"">ACO program</a> and <a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/how-doctors-are-paid/what-are-bundled-payments"">bundled payment</a> initiatives. Most hospital CEOs saying they expect to be on bundled payments in a few years. That's why hospitals are reducing their readmission rates; at present, a readmission is profitable, but hospitals suspect they won't be profitable in a few years.</p> \n<p>Right now we have one foot on the dock and one foot in the boat. The dock is the old fee-for-service system and the boat is a new, alternative payment system that is much more quality-based. It's untenable to try to do both.</p> \n<p>The dock wasn't working; we were <span>basically </span><span>destroying ourselves.

One simple drug switch could save Medicare $18 billion over the next decade,http://www.vox.com/2014/6/6/5786406/one-simple-drug-switch-could-save-medicare-18-billion-over-the-next,"Medicare covers two drugs that do the same thing. One costs $55, the other costs $2,023.","<p>Suppose Medicare pays for two drugs that do the same thing, but one drug is forty times more expensive than the other. Sounds like an easy target for savings, right?</p> \n<p>Unfortunately, the American healthcare system doesn't always take the easy path forward. A new study shows we're wasting $29 billion per decade in this exact type of situation, buying the more expensive drug.</p> \n<p><span>Avastin and Lucentis are both used to treat conditions that lead to blindness in elderly adults. Studies have shown that the two drugs have similar effectiveness and safety. But Avastin only costs $55 per dose to Lucentis's $2,023; patients can require up to 12 doses annually. Medicare Part B spending on these drugs totaled $2 billion in 2010 — about one-sixth of the Part B drug budget.</span></p> \n<p>This is a pretty obvious opportunity to save money for both Medicare and its enrollees, who often have to shoulder some costs of treatment out of pocket. But one-third of patients still receive therapy with Lucentis, despite — or, perhaps, because of — its astronomical cost.</p> \n<p>A <a href=""http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/33/6/931.abstract"">new paper</a> in Health Affairs found that if every patient received Avastin instead of Lucentis over the next decade, Medicare Part B would save $18 billion and patients would save $5 billion. There would be an additional $6 billion in other health care savings.</p> \n<p>Saving $29 billion over ten years won't put a huge dent in projected total health care spending, but it's still a lot of money to leave on the table.</p> \n<p>Part of the problem is the pharmaceutical company. Both drugs are manufactured by Genentech, a division of Roche. Avastin, the cheaper of the two drugs, was designed to treat certain kinds of cancers; this is what the FDA approved it for. When physicians use Avastin as a therapy against the onset of blindness, it's considered ""off-label"" use.</p> \n<p>Doctors have used the drug off-label to prevent the onset of blindness since since 2005 and the Office of Inspector General within the Department of Health and Human Services <a href=""http://oig.hhs.gov/oei/reports/oei-03-10-00360.pdf"">recommended</a> increasing the use of Avastin over Lucentis. If the manufacturer sought approval from FDA to market Avastin for treatment of these eye conditions, it would help achieve that goal.</p> \n<p>Genentech won't do that, though. They maintain that Lucentis was already designed to treat these eye conditions — but the fact that Lucentis is better for Genentech's bottom line probably isn't irrelevant.</p> \n<p>Physician payment could be a problem, too. The way Medicare reimburses for the drugs follows a formula. One dose of Lucentis will net the doctor $95, compared to $29 for Avastin. Consciously or not, doctors might be more likely to recommend the more profitable treatment, especially because Medicare picks up most of the tab.</p> \n<p>Doctors have recently faced more scrutiny for their use of Lucentis. In April, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services released a trove of data on Medicare payments to over 880,000 health care providers. The New York Times <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/10/business/eye-doctors-say-their-profits-are-smaller-than-medicare-data-makes-them-look.html"">noted</a> that ophthalmologists ranked highly in these reimbursements, a trend largely attributable to the drug. The Washington Post made it a <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/an-effective-eye-drug-is-available-for-50-but-many-doctors-choose-a-2000-alternative/2013/12/07/1a96628e-55e7-11e3-8304-caf30787c0a9_story.html"">front-page story</a>.</p> \n<p>The price discrepancy is known, and Medicare's recent data dump could turn up pressure on ophthalmologists to opt for Avastin. But this is likely to remain a source of wasteful spending so long as regulatory barriers and financial incentives shield Lucentis's $2,000 price tag.</p>"

What was your strategy for being ready, and do you think it contributed to things going relatively smoothly?</b></p> \n<p>Kevin Counihan: To be frank, I viewed it as a survival period. My goal was to get through open enrollment with as little customer disruption as possible and to make sure we earned the ability to start patching the system up in the summer of 2014. I thought that the time pressure was so tight that this was really just a time to make sure that you gained the credibly with your customers to earn the right to participate in the second year.</p> \n<p dir=""ltr"">I think there were about four things we were doing in the lead-up that worked for us. First it was the management team, it was getting the right kind of people. I hired the types of folks who wanted to prove something because you can't buy that type of commitment.</p> \n<p><q class=""center"" aria-hidden=""true"">'my goal was to get through open enrollment with as little consumer disruption as possible'</q></p> \n<p dir=""ltr"">Two was to create processes you could stick to and have the discipline to stick with our decisions. The third was vendor management. We all had these new vendors, nobody had enough to time to vet anyone as much as you would like, so how you manage the vendors was really important. The fourth is good software code, which isn't everything, but its important.</p> \n<p dir=""ltr"">Whenever we would make a decision, we would ask how does this impact consumers' ease and simplicity. If it added simplicity, it got accelerated. If it was something that didn't, it got cascaded down the list.</p> \n<p dir=""ltr""><b>SK: Can you tell me a bit about what your launch day was like on October 1?</b></p> \n<p dir=""ltr""><b></b><span>KC: On September 29 we were notified by the insurance department they had some concerns about the layout of the website. We had two days to get our system integrator to put a couple of qualifications on a couple of pages of the site. It basically required 24-hour around the clock work. It was one of these things were, you have to enter a Zen state.

Then the next day, we flipped the switch and goddammit it worked. We started looking at screens and saw people coming on the site and traffic growing and growing. Some people were getting a little emotional and high-fiving. It's really a day I'll never forget. </span></p> \n<p><b>SK: One of the things I remember from last fall was that, when other states were boasting about how great their exchanges would be and the president was comparing Healthcare.gov to Expedia, you were very intentionally setting expectations quite low for what you were doing in Connecticut, and warning people that it would be bumpy to start. Was it hard to deliver that kind of message when you would see other states talking about what amazing new things they were building? </b></p> \n<p>KC: Actually it was just the opposite. I didn't feel like we were in the big leagues of the exchanges in the summer of 2010. It felt like we were minors, like Triple-A or something.</p> \n<p>During my second week,  I went down to meet with CCIIO [the Center for Consumer Information and Insurance Oversight, the federal agency overseeing Obamacare] and they told me we were on the watch list of states that might not make. The Oregons and the Marylands, back then, seemed like these big sophisticated states that always had their act together.</p> \n<p>There's no heroes and villains in this thing. Everybody had their heart into this. I think some of us may have had more luck. Everybody tried, and some states are still trying.</p> \n<p><b>SK: When your site seemed to be working in the winter, and some other states' sites still weren't, were you starting to get calls from those places about what you guys did differently?</b></p> \n<p>KC: The calls started coming at the end of 2013. We got, I think, five calls from various states between after Thanksgiving and before January 1. And that's really when this idea about creating the exchange solutions division came from. Like everybody, we need to have a financially sustainable exchange in a few years and this seems like one way to get there. We start hitting the conference circuit and I started putting together an informal marketing plan with different states we could talk to.</p> \n<p><b>SK: Can you explain to me what exactly it is you're selling to other states?</b></p> \n<p>KC: It's basically three things. One is an outsource model. there are some red states looking at this.

Instead, his staff is exploring two options: whether they could use an executive order to expand Medicaid or, if they can't, how they could manage the first government shutdown in Virginia history.

But with the start of the new fiscal year less than a month away, the governor appears to be mulling over the extraordinary use of executive power, both to keep the lights on in state government and to muscle Medicaid expansion past the legislature.</span></p> \n<p>Either move would be a brazen challenge to the General Assembly, which under the state constitution has sole authority to appropriate money, including $2 billion a year in federal pass-through funds that would bankroll the Medicaid expansion.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>The latest twist in the story is arguably the craziest: Republicans appear to have persuaded a Democratic Senator to resign his seat in return for ""awarding his daughter a state judgeship and himself a job as deputy director of the state tobacco commission"" Vozzella <a href=""http://m.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/2014/06/08/901edf8e-ef54-11e3-914c-1fbd0614e2d4_story.html"">reported</a> Sunday night.</p> \n<p>This would give Republicans at least temporary 20-19 control of the Virginia Senate, which may be all they need to pass a budget that <i>excludes </i>Medicaid expansion. And it gives the Democratic Senator a pretty nice state government job to boot.</p> \n<p>How exactly this ends isn't clear at this point.

Diabetes is on the rise â€” and it's costing the US billions each year,http://www.vox.com/2014/6/10/5797264/diabetes-is-on-the-rise,New CDC report finds alarming increase.,"<p>Diabetes is on the rise in America, according to <a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/pubs/statsreport14/national-diabetes-report-web.pdf"">a new report</a> from the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention.</p> \n<p><q class=""right"" aria-hidden=""true"">the CDC projects the direct and indirect costs of diabetes total $245 billion</q></p> \n<p>The CDC estimates that 29.1 million people, or 9.3 percent of the US population, had diabetes in 2012. That's up from 25.8 million, or 8.3 percent of the US population, in 2010.</p> \n<p>More than one-fourth of the cases are undiagnosed, which means 8.1 million people most likely don't know they have diabetes.</p> \n<p>The rise comes with a large financial burden for the US. The CDC projects the direct and indirect costs of diabetes total $245 billion, with $176 billion going to direct medical costs and the rest going to indirect costs like disability, work loss, and premature death.</p> \n<p>The problem is poised to get a lot worse, too. The CDC estimates that 37 percent of US adults aged 20 and  older, or about 86 million Americans, have prediabetes, when blood sugar  levels are alarmingly high but not quite high enough to be classified  as diabetes. This population is at a high risk for eventually developing  diabetes, although lifestyle changes can prevent the disease.</p> \n<h3>What is diabetes, anyway?<br>\n</h3> \n<p>Diabetes is caused when the body can't properly process blood sugar.</p> \n<div class=""align-right""> \n<p><img alt=""131923907"" class=""photo"" src=""http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/assets/4593511/131923907.jpg""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">An insulin pen. Sajjad Hussain / AFP via Getty Images</p> \n</div> \n<p>There's two kinds of diabetes: Type 1 is relatively rare and believed to be caused by genetic and environmental factors, while type 2 is much more common and brought on by genetic predispositions, poor diet, and lack of exercise.</p> \n<p>Both types lead to high blood sugar, which can then lead to serious conditions  like heart disease, stroke, blindness, kidney failure, and lower-limb  amputation.</p> \n<p>Diabetes can be dealt with in a few ways. Type 1 is managed by directly injecting or pumping the body with insulin, the hormone that helps manage blood sugar. Type 2 is usually treated by adhering to a healthier diet and increasing exercise.</p> \n<h3>Diabetes is more prominent among men, minorities, and older populations<br>\n</h3> \n<p>Younger people are much less likely to have diabetes. The CDC estimates, in fact, that more than one in four Americans 65 and older have the disease.</p> \n<center> \n<p><img alt=""Diabetes_by_age"" class=""photo"" src=""http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/assets/4592959/diabetes_by_age.png""></p> \n</center> \n<p>Men also appear to be slightly more likely to develop diabetes.</p> \n<center> \n<p><img alt=""Diabetes_by_sex"" class=""photo"" src=""http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/assets/4592947/diabetes_by_sex.png""></p> \n</center> \n<p>Racial and ethnic minorities also have much higher rates of the illness.</p> \n<center> \n<p><img alt=""Diabetes_by_race"" class=""photo"" src=""http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/assets/4592935/diabetes_by_race.png""></p> \n</center> \n<h3>Some experts blame added sugar for the rise<br>\n</h3> \n<p>The CDC's latest report offers no explanation for the rise. But, at least with type 2 diabetes, the rise of diabetes is linked to America's increasingly sedentary lifestyle. It's no coincidence that <a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/obesity/data/index.html"">obesity</a> is becoming a bigger problem as diabetes gets worse as well.</p> \n<p><q class=""right"" aria-hidden=""true"">It's no coincidence that obesity is becoming a bigger problem as diabetes gets worse as well</q></p> \n<p>Some experts have also fixated on added sugar in particular to explain America's struggles with obesity and diabetes.</p> \n<p>""The data says that the dose on average that is safe is six to nine  teaspoons of added sugar per day. Currently, Americans are at 22  teaspoons of added sugar per day,"" said Robert Lustig of the University of California,  San Francisco, in <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/6/2/5771008/the-case-for-treating-sugar-like-a-drug/in/5551015"">a previous interview</a>.

People should, according to Lustig's critics, focus on improving their diets and reducing excess across the board, instead of demonizing one ingredient or food.</p> \n<p>Whatever the specific cause, everyone at least agrees on two changes that Americans could make to help prevent diabetes: eating healthier and exercising more often.</p> \n<h3>Further reading</h3> \n<ul> \n<li><a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/6/2/5771008/the-case-for-treating-sugar-like-a-drug/in/5551015"">The case for treating sugar like a drug</a></li> \n<li><a href=""http://www.vox.com/a/explain-food-america"">40 maps that explain food in America</a></li> \n<li><a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/6/5/5782240/a-6-cent-tax-could-be-enough-to-get-americans-to-drink-less-soda/in/5551015"">A 6-cent tax could be enough to get Americans to drink less soda</a></li> \n<li><a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/6/6/5786758/soda-is-even-worse-for-you-than-you-thought/in/5551015"">Soda is even worse for you than you thought</a></li> \n</ul> \n<p><b>Update</b>: Added more context about how type 2 diabetes is developed.</p> \n<ul> \n</ul>"

At the same time, the Bay State appears to have pulled off an impressive feat: it appears to have lowered the uninsured rate to nearly zero.

If that number holds true over time, it will mean the percentage of Massachusetts residents who lack coverage has dropped to less than 1 percent.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Massachusetts has long had the lowest uninsured rate in the nation since it passed its universal coverage law in 2006. But its always hovered a few percentage-points above zero. In 2011, 3.9 percent of Massachusetts residents lacked insurance coverage. One report <a href=""http://bluecrossmafoundation.org/sites/default/files/download/publication/Uninsured_in_MA_Report_FINAL_0.pdf"">found</a> that Massachusetts' uninsured tended to be more male and low-income compared to those with coverage.</p> \n<p>The data is still preliminary, and observers are waiting to see whether some of the people who gained coverage this winter actually stick with their new plans. As to why the Affordable Care Act would raise insurance rates in a state that has had nearly a decade of universal coverage, Bebinger, a long-time Romneycare observer, has a few thoughts:</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>First, there was a big federal enrollment campaign in the fall and spring that might have caught people's attention.</p> \n<p>Second, more residents are eligible for free coverage or subsidized help with premiums under the new federal insurance law.</p> \n<p>Third, most of those who were still uninsured in Massachusetts at the end of 2013 were low-income workers who could not afford premiums under an employer's plan. Under the previous Massachusetts health care law (enacted under then-Gov. Mitt Romney), workers were not allowed to sign up for state-subsidized insurance if they had access to a health plan through work. The federal law lifts that restriction.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p><b> Update: </b>Josh Archambault emails to point out that Massachusetts does still have about 200,000 people on temporary health insurance plans, a product of the state's <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/5/12/5691934/how-massachusetts-screwed-up-obamacare"">botched Obamacare rollout.</a> The state has not yet determined whether those people will qualify for insurance subsidies and its possible, if they don't, that these people will not stay in their coverage.</p>"

2 promising signs for US health spending,http://www.vox.com/2014/6/11/5800818/2-promising-signs-for-americas-growing-health-care-costs,Good news for Medicare and maybe everyone else.,"<p>Health-care spending might not be growing so quickly after all.</p> \n<p><q class=""right"" aria-hidden=""true"">the Bureau of Economic Analysis's initial estimates may have been wrong </q></p> \n<p>Earlier this year, the Bureau of Economic Analysis <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/4/15/5612900/health-spending-growth-fast"">projected</a> that health-care spending would massively increase in the first quarter of 2014. In the health wonk world, that inspired a lot of panic about the return of high health-care cost growth. Not only would that make health care more expensive for everyone, but it would further strain budgets at all levels of government.</p> \n<p>The good news is the latest federal data on health spending suggests that the Bureau of Economic Analysis's initial estimates may have been wrong and could be revised downward. If that's the case, health-care spending could still be growing at the same timid pace it has been for years.</p> \n<h3>Medicare appears to be growing very slowly</h3> \n<p>For the federal government, the most promising news comes through Medicare.</p> \n<p>The latest data, as <a href=""http://crfb.org/blogs/determining-medicares-underlying-growth"">broken down</a> by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, shows underlying Medicare growth, even after adjusting for temporary policies, is growing at just 2.5 percent. That's more than a full percentage point below economic and beneficiary growth. Medicare, in other words, is growing slower as a percent of the economy and on a per-person basis.</p> \n<center> \n<p><img alt=""Medicare_mbr"" class=""photo"" src=""http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/assets/4599119/medicare_mbr.jpg""></p> \n</center> \n<p>A percentage point might not seem like a huge deal. But if the trend holds, it could translate to billions of dollars in savings for the federal government. As Vox's Sarah Kliff <a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/health-care-spending/what-does-it-mean-to-bend-the-health-care-cost-curve"">explained</a>, getting health spending growth from red to yellow, as shown in the chart below, is a major cost-saving goal for the federal government.</p> \n<center> \n<p><img alt=""Cost_curve"" class=""photo"" src=""http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/assets/4201477/cost_curve.png""></p> \n</center> \n<p>What's interesting is the data analyzed by CRFB actually shows Medicare growth trending down below the yellow line. There's plenty of reason, based on <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/4/15/5612900/health-spending-growth-fast"">historical and even recent trends</a>, to doubt that will hold. But if it does, it's huge news for government health-care spending.</p> \n<h3>There's some signs overall health-care spending could be revised downward</h3> \n<p>For the rest of the country, the latest quarterly services report from the Census Bureau suggests health-care spending isn't rising as quickly as previously anticipated.</p> \n<p>Earlier in the year, the Bureau of Economic Analysis <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/4/15/5612900/health-spending-growth-fast"">estimated</a> that the first quarter of health-care spending would grow by 9.9 percent. But this early estimate is based largely on modeling and guesswork, since the BEA didn't have hard spending data to go off when they made their projections.</p> \n<p>Now that we have hard spending data, it looks like the 9.9 percent projection was too high. Ambulatory health-care services reported just 2.2 percent year-over-year growth, and hospitals reported 3.5 percent growth.</p> \n<center> \n<p><img alt=""Dueling_numbers_on_health_spending_growth"" class=""photo"" src=""http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/assets/4599455/dueling_numbers_on_health_spending_growth.png""></p> \n</center> \n<p>Larry Levitt, senior vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation, says the lower numbers give him reason to believe the Bureau of Economic Analysis overshot its estimates and will revise them downward in the future. He suggests the agency may have overestimated how much pent-up demand there was for health-care services among the uninsured, many of whom are now insured under <a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/obamacare"">Obamacare</a> and now have greater access to health care.</p> \n<p>Now, it's possible this data will be revised or the slow growth trend is temporary. Levitt, for instance, points out that if there was a lot of pent-up demand for health-care services among the uninsured, that would more likely show up in the second quarter.</p> \n<p>But, for now, there's at least two reasons to be a little more optimistic about health-care spending.</p>"

The clock is ticking on funding health insurance for kids,http://www.vox.com/2014/6/12/5803310/the-clock-is-ticking-on-funding-health-insurance-for-kids,Funding for a major children's health insurance program will expire unless Congress acts â€” and Obamacare can't fill all of the gaps.,"<p>Unless Congress appropriates new funds at some point in the next year, coverage for millions of children will lapse in September 2015.</p> \n<p>The Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) covered <a href=""http://kaiserfamilyfoundation.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/8570-children_s-health-coverage-medicaid-chip-and-the-aca1.pdf"">5.7 million</a> children in 2009. It was enacted by President Clinton in 1997 and was temporarily reauthorized under President Obama during his first year in office.</p> \n<p>But funding for the program expires at the end of September 2015.</p> \n<p>CHIP operates under the Medicaid umbrella and covers children whose family incomes are too high to qualify them for traditional Medicaid. CHIP — unlike the traditional program — is funded through block grants; states receive a fixed amount of money from the federal government, which they match with state dollars.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""center"">TWO MILLION CHILDREN WILL BE WITHOUT AFFORDABLE COVERAGE IF CONGRESS FAILS TO CONTINUE CHIP'S FUNDING.</q></p> \n<p>The situation for children isn't so dire now as it was in 2009. Now that the state health insurance exchanges exist, many families with children enrolled in CHIP would have access to affordable forms of coverage on the exchange. Not all of them, though.</p> \n<p>Due to a mistake in the way the Affordable Care Act was written, an estimated two million children will be without affordable coverage if Congress fails to continue CHIP's funding. The mistake, known in health policy circles as the ""<a href=""http://ccf.georgetown.edu/media/the-acas-family-glitch-could-hurt-families-who-need-chip/"">family glitch</a>,"" prohibits families with incomes below 400 percent of the federal poverty line from receiving subsidies if one of the parents has health insurance through their employer — even when that coverage won't cover dependent spouses or children.</p> \n<p>Senator Rockefeller of West Virginia has <a href=""http://www.rockefeller.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/files/serve?File_id=48c49835-77dc-49bb-a248-78ed6c76fb17&amp;SK=D575F75F612DB7462F732716E82DF88D"">proposed legislation</a> to extend CHIP funding through 2019.

There are gaps between the dental benefits that CHIP offers and the dental benefits provided through most exchange plans. Moreover, out-of-pocket costs would be higher for families with plans purchased through the exchange, which could discourage people from signing up altogether. It's one thing for an adult to take on the risk of being uninsured; CHIP provides a safety net for children who can't take any action to insure themselves.</p> \n<p>The stakes for this are higher than the affordability of health insurance. A <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/6/4/5776050/kids-who-get-health-insurance-are-more-likely-to-finish-high-school"">recent study</a> used the initial CHIP expansion to determine whether the program had an effect on education. The authors found long-run positive effects on high school and college attainment.</p> \n<p>Continued funding for CHIP requires an act of Congress, no small feat in an era of growing polarization. But this time, it is — quite literally — for the children.</p>"

Orszag: It's time for some optimism about health care spending,http://www.vox.com/2014/6/15/5807046/orszag-its-time-for-some-optimism-about-health-care-spending,Health coverage is surging. Health care spending isn't.,"<p><i>Peter Orszag served as director of the Congressional Budget Office from 2007 to 2008, then as director of the Office of Management and Budget from 2009 to 2010. He is currently a vice chairman at Citigroup but, during his time in the Obama administration, worked on the Affordable Care Act. He continues to speak and write on health care, including on </i><a href=""https://twitter.com/porszag"">his Twitter account</a><i>. </i></p> \n<p><i style=""line-height: 1.5;"">I asked Orszag to walk through some recent trends in health spending, and explain why the news is so surprising — and so positive. What follows is a transcript of our conversation, edited for length and clarity.</i></p> \n<p><b>Adrianna McIntyre: Can you set up what's been happening recently with health care spending and why it's such a big deal?</b></p> \n<p>Peter Orszag: We have had incredibly good news over the past three to five years. If I'd been told when I was director of either CBO or OMB that we would have a 12-month period when Medicare spending was basically flat in nominal terms — and therefore on an inflation-adjusted, per-beneficiary basis, significantly negative — I would have thought impossible and yet that's exactly what we're living through.</p> \n<p>If this continues, it's massive — everything you think you know about the nation's long-term fiscal gap would be wrong.</p> \n<p><b>AM: Earlier this spring, there were reports that health care spending was spiking again, which caused a stir in the media. What should we make of that? </b></p> \n<p>PO: This debate centers on data released earlier this year on health care spending. We saw a significant uptick in the first quarter of last year, and then especially in the first quarter of this year.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""right"">""We would expect some uptick in spending as more people become insured.""</q></p> \n<p>I'm going to be a little critical of the media here<span>: there were a lot of stories written about those numbers in April, suggesting that the slowdown we've been experiencing is over. Done. That it's been reversed.</span></p> \n<p>That misses two things.</p> \n<p>First, we would expect <i>some</i> uptick in spending as more people become insured. That doesn't tell us anything about the underlying trend in spending among those who were <i>already</i> insured, which is the more relevant question for whether or not the slowdown is continuing. On that question, we do have the Medicare data, and Medicare has continued to grow very slowly.</p> \n<p>The second point is that preliminary GDP numbers are basically a guess. The Bureau of Economic Analysis does not have very much real data upon which to base their projections, but they estimated a 9.9 percent surge in health spending during the first quarter of 2014.</p> \n<p>Now, we actually have that data. They show that from the first quarter of 2013 to the first quarter of 2014, health care spending <span>only </span><span>increased by 2.9 percent. That's before taking out inflation; in real terms, spending growth was basically zero. </span></p> \n<p><span>Comparing the first quarter of 2014 to the preceding three months — which was the focus of all the anxiety, because of the coverage expansion — it looks like real spending actually <i>declined</i>.</span></p> \n<p><b>AM: We don't talk about ""decline"" in health spending very often.</b></p> \n<p>PO: It's shocking! This survey is the basis for the estimates, but there are other elements, so we'll see what happens with the revisions. I am absolutely sure that the 9.9 percent annualized growth that was reported with preliminary estimates will be revised down significantly.</p> \n<p><q class=""center"" aria-hidden=""true"">""if you had told me that we would insure millions of people and spending would be flat — or down — I would have been shocked.""</q></p> \n<p>That's very reassuring, and it's surprising, frankly, given the significant expansion in coverage. If you told me that we would insure millions of people and total spending would be flat — or down — in real terms, I would have been shocked.</p> \n<p><b>AM: If you had to speculate, what would you say is driving the slowdown?</b></p> \n<p><q class=""right"" aria-hidden=""true"">""YOU CAN CONSTRAIN OR REDUCE SPENDING WHILE WRENCHING INEFFICIENCY OUT OF THE SYSTEM.""</q></p> \n<p>PO: I believe three things are driving the deceleration. One is that consumers are playing a bigger role in choosing their own health care and they face higher cost-sharing in the commercial space. That's not relevant to Medicare. Another factor relevant to the commercial space is the economic slowdown. That's also not relevant to Medicare; there's no evidence that Medicare is significantly affected by the state of the business cycle.</p> \n<p>So that leaves us asking, what's affecting the slowdown in Medicare? One factor is that the systems are being digitized, so hospital executives have a much better sense of what's going on within the hospital and can target waste. The second thing is that the payment system is changing, and it's expected to continue to change.</p> \n<p>The vignette I like to use is that lots of hospitals across the country have succeeded in reducing their readmissions. <span>One example here is Mount Sinai in New York, where I'm on the board. They started a program to screen people at high risk of readmission; they assign social workers to those people. The intervention works very well: emergency room visits and readmissions are down 50 percent for this high-risk population.</span></p> \n<p>Why is Mount Sinai doing this? Right now, it's losing a ton of money on that program — it's <i>bleeding</i> money. Effectively, it's losing revenue on those lost readmissions.</p> \n<p>But it's doing this because it expects the payment system to be different within three to five years. In particular, it expects the system to be much more value-based, with a fixed payment per patient. In that situation, incentives get flipped on their head; you really want to reduce readmissions.</p> \n<p><span>There are things being done today in anticipation of what the payment system will look like tomorrow.</span></p> \n<p><b>AM: How much of a role do you think the Affordable Care Act is playing, if any? </b></p> \n<p>PO: I would say the ACA is a small part of this. If you survey hospital executives, most of them they expect the majority of their revenue to be value-based within five years. Part of that is driven by the ACA, part is driven by private insurers, and part is driven by employers pressuring private insurers to change their payment practices.</p> \n<p><q class=""right"" aria-hidden=""true"">""if expectations are not realized, a lot of this progress may get reversed.""</q></p> \n<p>I'm not going to try to hazard a guess about <i>exactly</i> what share is due to health reform. I would just say that <a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/how-doctors-are-paid/what-are-bundled-payments"">bundled payment</a>, <a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/how-doctors-are-paid/what-are-accountable-care-organizations"">ACOs</a>, and other reforms are directionally consistent with this expectation of value-based payment. The ACA has contributed to a general perception that this is the direction the system's moving.</p> \n<p>And therein lies the risk: if those expectations are not realized, a lot of this progress may get reversed.</p> \n<p><b>AM: There are economists who aren't comfortable pointing to the Affordable Care Act when trying to explain the slowdown, because health spending growth is slowing in other nations, too. What's your take on that? </b></p> \n<p>PO: In lots of other countries there have been fiscal policy changes that, in addition to the economic downturn, have constrained health care spending.</p> \n<p>I don't find other countries' experience to be that insightful for the deceleration in the United States, except in the commercial space. In the commercial sector, many of the things affecting spending, like the economic slowdown, are relevant to the rest of the world.</p> \n<p>In the rest of the world you also have some policy changes. Depending over what time period you go, the movement in pharmaceutical spending toward generics is not only a U.S. phenomenon; that would be affecting other nations as well.</p> \n<p>We can look at trends in Medicare and the commercial sector, but the factors that drive those sectors are different. The reason I like to focus on what's been happening to Medicare — where cost trends have looked phenomenally good — is that there's no evidence across states the state of the economy impacts Medicare spending. I<span>t's a purer indicator of underlying trends than comparisons to other countries or the commercial part of the market.</span></p> \n<p><b>AM: What's the big-picture bottom line for the United States, if this is the new normal for health spending? </b></p> \n<p>PO: I think it is the most under-appreciated, under-covered phenomenon in the last five years, because it <span>will be transformational for the federal, state, local governments if these trends continue. More than a trillion dollars in deficit reduction, according to CBO.</span></p> \n<p><q class=""center"" aria-hidden=""true"">""it is the most under-appreciated, under-covered phenomenon of the last five years.""</q></p> \n<p>I like to say, as a former director of the CBO, that I can assure you the agency doesn't like to update its numbers very rapidly in response to new information. <span>Depending on how you do the calculation, </span><span>we're talking about a markdown of 900 billion to $1.2 trillion in the ten-year deficit numbers, which shows what a disproportionate effect it could have on our long-term fiscal outlook. </span></p>"
Healthcare.gov's terrible rollout didn't scare away insurers,http://www.vox.com/2014/6/13/5807132/healthcare-govs-terrible-rollout-didnt-scare-away-insurers,"Even with a rocky start, more health plans want to sell on the new marketplaces.","<p><span>It looks like Obamacare shoppers will have more choices when they start looking for coverage in 2015.</span></p> \n<p>States are just now beginning to publish information on which insurers plan to sell on their health exchanges next year. In the seven states that have so far made that information public, all but one have an increase in the total number of insurers who want to participate in the new marketplace.</p> \n<p>Dan Diamond at the Advisory Board<a href=""http://www.advisory.com/daily-briefing/blog/2014/06/insurers-jumping-in-year-2""> pulled together </a>many of these insurers' filings, and they show a strong trend of insurers getting more bullish on Obamacare in year two.</p> \n<p><img alt=""Exchange_competition"" class=""photo"" src=""http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/assets/4611515/exchange_competition.png""> This trend isn't a total surprise. Many insurers — especially the large, national companies — strategically took a cautious approach to the health insurance exchanges in 2014. ""</p> \n<p>They didn't have much of an idea what they were getting into. Insurers didn't know how much their competitors would charge, for example, or what type of consumers would sign up. There were also worries (later proved completely founded) that the shopping experience would be messy in year one.</p> \n<p>Insurers appear more enthusiastic to go into year two. ""We're having some real competition out there,"" says Bob Crittenden, senior health policy advisor to Washington Gov. Jay Inslee. ""It looks like that part is going exceedingly well.""</p> \n<p>It's not just new entrants into the exchanges that's increasing competition. In Washington, for example, there are two plans that only sold in small parts of the state that now want to sell everywhere. Both United Health Care and Moda, a local plan, are increasing the geographic area of where they plan to sell coverage.</p> \n<p>The only state that hasn't reported an increase in carriers for 2015 is Oregon. There, all 12 carriers who sold in 2014 plan to sell again in 2015, but no new insurers have proposed rates. It's possible that this has to do with Oregon's incredibly challenged Obamacare rollout — or it could reflect the fact that Oregon had one of the most competitive Obamacare markets to begin with.</p> \n<p>More nationally though, the trend seems to be clear: More insurers are getting into the Obamacare game in year two.</p>"
Maybe we don't all need annual physicals,http://www.vox.com/2014/6/16/5807608/maybe-we-dont-all-need-annual-physicals,"""Almost nothing in the complete annual physical examination is based on evidence. Why, then, do we continue to examine healthy patients?""","<p>The annual exam is one of the most common and encouraged procedures in modern medicine. Whether it actually helps people get any healthier, however, isn't completely clear. Earlier this month, Michael Rothberg wrote <a href=""http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=1877214"">an article </a>for the <i>Journal of the American Medical Association </i>questioning the traditional exam and its role in the medical system. Much of the article centered on his father's experience a decade ago, when an annual check-up triggered a number of follow-up tests that cost $50,000 and ended up doing more harm than good.</p> \n<p>""Almost nothing in the complete annual physical examination is based on evidence,"" Rothberg, who directs the Cleveland Clinic Medicine Institute Center for Value-Based Care Research, wrote. ""Why, then, do we continue to examine healthy patients?""</p> \n<p>Rothberg says that this JAMA piece generated more feedback from doctors than all the other articles he's previously published combined. We spoke about the role of the annual physical, whether it plays a valuable role in the medical system, and what could be done to improve the regular encounter with a physician. What follows is a transcript of our discussion, lightly edited for clarity and length.</p> \n<p><b>Sarah Kliff: How you think about the annual physical? Whats its role?</b></p> \n<p>Michael Rothberg: What I was trying to get at in this article had to do with the dangers of looking for problems when patients don't have any complaints. I definitely didn't want people to come away thinking you should never examine a patient or that patients shouldn't go to the doctor. The point I was trying to make is that our ability to pick up disease through a physical exam when patients don't have any complaints is a misconception that we've fostered for the last fifty years.</p> \n<p><b>SK: What do you think about the body of evidence we have on annual physicals, and whether they improve health outcomes?</b></p> \n<div class=""align-right""></div> \n<p><q class=""right"" aria-hidden=""true"">'you're very unlikely to have any serious diseases that haven't shown symptoms'</q></p> \n<p>MR: There are wellness exams for Medicare patients who are generally 65 and older, which don't actually include much of a physical exam. Then there's probably a corollary for younger patients as well. There are a few different components to it, and one would be that piece of looking for diseases that may not be apparent to the patient. One of the easiest tests is checking blood pressure, because we know undiagnosed hypertension is an important problem. That's very easy to detect, as is obesity.  For women, it's also important to get screened regularly for cervical cancer.</p> \n<p>In terms of evidence though, I don't know we have evidence one way or another about whether you need to go to a physical exam to do this. Let's say you're 35-years-old and you have a scale in your home, and you can check your blood pressure at the grocery store.  I'm not sure you need an annual visit to the physician. You're very unlikely to have any serious diseases that haven't shown symptoms.  For older patients, there are additional benefits that make annual visit worthwhile, like reviewing medications, doing appropriate screening tests, getting vaccinations, having your vision tested, and discussing preferences for end of life care.  These are all covered by Medicare.</p> \n<div style=""text-align:center"">\n<img src=""http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/assets/4621985/physicals.png"" class=""photo"" alt=""Physicals""> <br id=""1402926322929""> \n<p> </p> \n</div> \n<p>There is also the argument that you should develop a therapeutic relationship with your provider, so that when you do get sick, you'll have somebody who knows you. This is important if you have a chronic disease, but it doesn't seem like its a great argument for young patients. What are the chances that when you do become sick, that you'll still have the same insurance and you'll be able to get an appointment with that same doctor? It sounds like it makes sense, but I don't know if that's often how it plays out.</p> \n<p><b>SK: One of the things you wrote about in your JAMA article is that often, among your colleagues, you get the reaction of ""well, what's the harm?"" And one of the things that was interesting about your piece, is you went through a situation where there really was a harm from one of these types of appointments.</b></p> \n<p>MR: It goes back to this idea of trying to catch disease early and potentially save lives. We want to be able to say, ""I saved somebody's life because I recognized something they didn't recognize.""</p> \n<p>But in our search as doctors to discover these things, we encounter a lot of other things that we don't know the meaning of. That was the case in my father's situation. His doctor thought he discovered an aortic aneurysm through the physical exam. That's something that you really do have to capture early, before it ruptures. So if you find it early, that's really great.</p> \n<p>Then there was an ultrasound, that showed there wasn't an aortic aneurysm but he saw something in the pancreas. So then we thought, well maybe we luckily discovered pancreatic cancer. The doctor then recommended a CT scan, which showed he didn't have pancreatic cancer but it looked like he might have liver cancer. So we had a biopsy for that. My father was in reasonably good health and the biopsy almost killed him.</p> \n<p>This all started with a routine physical, and you can't say there was any benefit to him with anything that happened.</p> \n<p><b>SK: Does this happen a lot in medicine? If you imagine a situation where one of these medical conditions actually proved to be real, then this story would look very different. How should doctors decide when these tests are a good idea, versus something like a wild goose chase?</b></p> \n<p>MR: I think it all comes down to what is the probability, pre-test, that you would actually have the thing we're testing for before we go looking for it. One thing people don't understand, is they think we have a better ability to understand what's going on in scan images than we actually do. That's where a huge disconnect is. There's this belief that we can see into the body and know what's going on.</p> \n<p><q class=""center"" aria-hidden=""true"">people 'think we have a better ability to understand what's going on in scan images than we actually do.'</q></p> \n<p>There are companies out there that offer full body CT scans.  And they find things.  They find thyroid nodules and adrenal masses.  They find abnormal areas of the liver or the spleen.  They find lung nodules and ovarian cysts.  The problem is what do you do next?  You can't make the diagnosis based on the image.  Usually you have to get tissue and that means either surgery or at the very least putting a needle into the thing and taking a sample.  Even after you have the biopsy you don't always know.  The more we look the more anxious we become and the more aggressive about finding an answer.</p> \n<p>On the other hand, we have some tests that we know work.  Screening for cervical cancer with Pap smears has almost eliminated cervical cancer in women who go for screening.  Colon cancer screening is also very effective, but we have a hard time getting patients to go for it.  And of course, if you have a concerning symptom, it needs to be addressed.</p> \n<p><b>SK: We seem to have a mentality in situations like these of ""better safe than sorry,"" that it's okay to do these extra tests and do annual exams that might not necessarily show much benefit, rather than risk missing something.</b></p> \n<p>MR: We have this with a lot of different kinds of cancer. Thyroid cancer fits this category. We detect it by finding thyroid nodules and we're now really good at finding those nodules. When we biopsy, we now detect cancer 5-10 percent of the time. We're diagnosing a lot of people with thyroid cancer who wouldn't have been diagnosed before.  But despite the fact that we are treating a lot more people with thyroid cancer, the number of people dying from thyroid cancer hasn't really budged.  That implies that the extra cases we are finding didn't benefit from treatment.</p> \n<p>My sister went to a doctor for an exam when she was around 40. Her doctor did a very thorough physical exam and found a lump in her thyroid. He sent her for an ultrasound that showed several thyroid nodules. They decided not to biopsy, but put her on thyroid medication to try and keep the nodules from growing, and she had an ultrasound every six months. She did this for a number of years, and it cost thousands and thousands of dollars. Finally, she started asking about the potential harms of the medication. And it turns out it could cause osteoporosis. She asked me why she was taking it, and I told her I really didn't know. So she decided to stop, and 15 years later there hasn't been a problem.</p> \n<p><b>SK: What do you think the proper role of the annual physical should be for people who don't have medical complaints? Is there value at turning up at the doctor on a regular basis?</b></p> \n<p><q class=""right"" aria-hidden=""true"">'for people who are truly healthy...those people are probably good to go without these exams until age 50'</q></p> \n<p>MR: For people who are truly healthy, who understand what it is to have a healthy lifestyle, those people are probably good to go without these exams until age 50. They do need to have an annual blood pressure check, and there are some vaccines that you need to get regularly, like tetanus. I don't think its a bad idea to check in with the medical system, but it's really the physician's responsibility to limit contact to things we know are based in evidence.</p> \n<p>There are so many things they can determine through a visit that doesn't really happen with the physical exam itself. I think its good for people to have a doctor, because sometimes you're really just looking for an expert to give advice. It may not change our outcome, but having someone to reassure you can be a big help.</p> \n<p><b>SK: What's the reaction to this piece been like so far?</b></p> \n<p>MR: I got more responses to this than everything else I've ever written put together. Most of the emails were positive and brief, saying you've said exactly what I've been thinking for a long time. There were some people who wanted to go even further. A few people were upset about the fact my father had gone for a biopsy, and said he shouldn't have done that. But overall, it was a really positive reaction.</p>"

Like the rest of the West Coast, Obamacare moved forward easily in a state where Democrats controlled the legislature and governorship. </span></p> \n<div style=""text-align:center""></div> \n<p><q class=""center"" aria-hidden=""true"">washington is, in many ways, a best case scenario for obamacare</q></p> \n<p>Setting up the website wasn't easy, even with the political will in place. The first time Washington got to hook its system up to the federal database was at 4 a.m. the morning of October 1 — just hours before Washingtonians would start shopping for coverage.</p> \n<p>""The last set of guidance we got was on August 31 and we had to go live by October 1,"" Washington Health Plan Finder executive director Richard Onizuka says. ""There were several places where we'd build something and say, hopefully it will be okay. We often didn't have the requirements.""</p> \n<p>The Washington exchange did work in that early morning test on October 1. But as more people began to log onto the website, it melted down. By mid-morning, officials decided to take the site offline to fix the problem. Within a few days, the site was functioning well for most consumers, while Healthcare.gov still remained frustratingly broken.</p> \n<div class=""align-left""></div> \n<p><q class=""left"" aria-hidden=""true"">about 90 to 95 percent of applications in washington get through</q></p> \n<p>Washington managed to build a website that not only worked better than the federal marketplace, but also had more complex functions. It is among a handful of states, for example, that collect the insurance premium from the consumer and pass it on to the insurance company. That means Washington can track who has actually paid for their coverage, which Healthcare.gov cannot measure.</p> \n<p>More than 164,000 Washingtonians bought private coverage coverage during open enrollment in 2014. That works out to about one-third of those eligible to purchase coverage this year deciding to enroll.</p> \n<p>""The front-end is working pretty well,"" Onizuka says. ""About 90 to 95 percent of applications get through.""</p> \n<p>The back-end of the site — where insurers find out who signed up for their products, check for payment and send out member ID cards — is a slightly different story.</p> \n<h3>'I don't think anyone imagined it would be as hard as it was'</h3> \n<p><span>Eight months after open enrollment began, insurers and community health centers still report significant problems figuring out who has coverage and getting those new insurance plans to work.</span></p> \n<p><span>""I don't think anyone imagined it would be as hard as it was to implement this website,"" says Eileen Cody, who chairs the health care and wellness committee at the Washington Legislature.

Kitti Cramer, Premera's vice president of government affairs and public relations, says about 10,000 of those members are stuck in limbo, not sure whether the plan they actually have coverage through the plan they selected.</span></p> \n<p>""We're in June and still have members who don't know if they have coverage going back to January,"" Cramer says. ""Those type of calls continue today, mostly from people who are stuck in the accounting system.""</p> \n<p>Health plans have their own technical problems. Community health centers report that the portals built by insurers who cover patients in the Medicaid program are clunky; it can take up to four hours, for example, just to log into the site so they can see what doctors are in their patients' networks.</p> \n<p>Cody, the legislator whose committee oversees health care implementation, says she's frustrated. It's not that she doesn't think Obamacare is a good idea — instead, she thinks its such a good idea, she wishes the state could make it work even better.</p> \n<p>""People are still having problems,"" Cody says.

It's largely talk about trying to iron out the problems that consumers are still having, and trying to convince Washingtonians that the plans they purchased this year are a good enough deal to re-enroll in 2015.</p> \n<p>""There have been a lot of bumps,"" Crittenden says. ""That's what drives me a little crazy, that we're still building the plane when its in the air. We'll be doing that for a long time, since this is a big IT project.

Five ways the American health care system is literally the worst,http://www.vox.com/2014/6/16/5812898/five-ways-the-american-health-care-system-is-literally-the-worst,"The United States comes in dead last in a new, international ranking of health care systems from a top health care think tank.","<p><span>The United States comes in dead last in a new, international ranking of health care systems from a top health-care non-profit.</span></p> \n<p>This doesn't mean that we're the worst in the world; there are plenty of less-developed countries that have worse systems than America's. But when the United States is compared against peer countries like France and Canada it does not come out well. It comes out the very worst.</p> \n<p><a href=""http://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/fund-reports/2014/jun/mirror-mirror"" style=""line-height: 1.5;"">A new Commonwealth Fund report</a> looks at how the United States stacks up against other countries on things like access to doctors and quality of care. It pulls from three separate surveys conducted over the past three years: a 2011 survey of sicker patients, a 2012 survey of doctors and a 2013 survey of adults over 18. It also uses health outcome data from the OECD and World Health Organization. This means it captures the experience of the medical system from the people who use it a lot, those who use it a little and the doctors treating them.</p> \n<h3><span>America ranks worst overall</span></h3> \n<p>The American health care system came in last both in the overall rankings, which pull together data on 11 specific measures of success for a health care system. This includes metrics like how easily residents can access health care, if that medical care is affordable and if its effective.</p> \n<p>There was no measure where the United States came in first place — our best ranking was coming in third in the effectiveness of our medicine (more on what this means later).</p> \n<p><img alt=""Commonwealth_rankings"" class=""photo"" src=""http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/assets/4619835/commonwealth_rankings.png"">In addition to coming in last overall, there were four specific measures where the United States came in last: cost-related problems, efficiency, equity and health outcomes.</p> \n<h3><span><b>America ranks worst for cost-related problems</b></span></h3> \n<p><span><b></b>Americans have the most trouble affording medical services; a higher percentage of Americans go without needed care because of cost than people surveyed in any other nation. </span></p> \n<p><span>Thirty-seven percent of Americans in this survey, for example, said they skipped some type of recommended care because of the price.</span></p> \n<p><img alt=""Commonwealth1"" class=""photo"" src=""http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/assets/4619899/commonwealth1.png""></p> \n<p>Americans were almost most likely to report out-of-pocket expenses above $1,000 and to have serious problems paying their medical bills.</p> \n<p>The challenges that Americans have paying their medical bills likely stem from two unique characteristics of the health care system. First, American health care is expensive: the United States spends way more per person on health care than other industrialized nations. We have higher prices for <a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/health-prices/america-is-getting-gouged-on-health-care-prices"">drugs</a> and<a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/health-prices/if-you-want-a-ct-scan-that-costs-802-less-go-to-canada""> imaging scans </a>than other countries. Our spending,  as you can see in the Commonwealth Fund charts below, is an outlier.</p> \n<p><img alt=""Health_spending"" class=""photo"" src=""http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/assets/4621953/health_spending.png""></p> \n<p>The other part of the explanation: the United States is the only country in this study without universal coverage. During the Commonwealth Fund conducted this survey, the uninsured rate hovered around <a href=""http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/hlthins/data/incpovhlth/2012/highlights.html"">15 percent.</a> That works out to about 48 million Americans who didn't have a source of coverage to help pay their medical bills.</p> \n<h3>America ranks worst on an efficient health care system</h3> \n<p>Most countries use some form of rate-setting: the government sets specific prices for medical services that each hospital and doctor can charge. This tends to make billing simpler: hospitals know there's exactly one price for every knee replacement, CT scan and eye exam, regardless of which insurer foots the bill.</p> \n<p>That doesn't happen in the United States. Here, we have thousands of health insurance companies who negotiate individually with hospitals and doctors. Every knee replacement in the United States has a different price depending on what deal the insurer has set up with the provider.</p> \n<p><span>This means we end up spending more than other country on the business of getting bills paid. The United States, for example, devotes 7.1 percent of total health care spending on administrative costs.  That's more than twice as much as the United Kingdom and three times as much as Australia.</span></p> \n<p>This matters for the patient experience: More American patients report spending lots of time on paperwork related to medical bills than any other country in the survey. Doctors also reported a higher percentage of time spent dealing with administrative issues.</p> \n<p><img alt=""Efficiency"" class=""photo"" src=""http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/assets/4619939/efficiency.png""></p> \n<p>There's a bit of a pattern to the numbers above. The countries where more people report spending lots of time dealing with medical bills — like the United States, France and the Netherlands — are all multi-payer systems, where there are multiple insurers contracting with hospitals and doctors. The countries with the lowest rates of billing issues, like the United Kingdom and New Zealand, have a national health service, where the country owns all the doctors and hospitals. That seems to reduce the amount of complicated medical bills that turn up in patients' mailboxes.</p> \n<p><b style=""font-family: Balto, sans-serif; font-size: 1.5em; line-height: 1.125em;"">America ranks worst on equity in health care</b></p> \n<p><b></b><span> </span><span>The Institute of Medicine defines equity as ""providing care that does not vary in quality because of personal characteristics"" like income or location. The United States does not do a very good job of this. </span></p> \n<p><span>There are big gaps in how Americans with different incomes use the health-care system, with lower-earning Americans being more likely to skip recommended care. Like other measures, this reflects the high costs and insurance gaps of the American system. </span><span></span></p> \n<p><img alt=""Equity"" class=""photo"" src=""http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/assets/4620011/equity.png""></p> \n<p>""Americans with below-average incomes were much more likely than their counterparts to report not visiting a physician when sick; not getting a recommended test, treatment, or follow-up care; or not filling a prescription or skipping doses when needed because of costs,"" the Commonwealth Fund report finds. ""On each of these indicators, one-third or more of lower-income adults in the U.S. said they went without needed care because of cost in the past year.""</p> \n<p>The Affordable Care Act is likely to reduce, but not fully eliminate these gaps. There has already been <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/6/5/5782320/the-uninsured-rate-has-plummeted-since-obamacare-kicked-in"">a noticeable decline</a> in the uninsured rate since the law's insurance expansion began. But there are also <a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/obamacare/is-obamacare-available-in-all-states"">24 states </a>that have not yet committed to expanding Medicaid, the program meant to cover low-income Americans. Without that coverage, there will likely be millions of Americans who are still unable to afford their medical care.</p> \n<p><b style=""font-family: Balto, sans-serif; font-size: 1.5em; line-height: 1.125em;"">America ranks worst on healthy lives</b></p> \n<p><span><b></b>The whole goal of a health care system is to help people get healthier. The United States does spend a lot more money on health care than any other country in this survey. That could make sense if all that additional spending was leading to a better quality of life for Americans, if we lived longer, for example, or had healthier lives.</span></p> \n<p>Unfortunately, the United States comes in dead last when ranked on healthy lives. This metric includes three basic indicators (the only ones available for cross-country comparisons). They are deaths that could have been prevented with care (we have more of those), infant mortality and life expectancy.</p> \n<p>A healthy 60-year-old man in the United States can expect to live 17.5 more years, which is less than a healthy 60-year-old man in Australia (who has 18.7 additional years of life expectancy) or Switzerland (19 additional years).</p> \n<p>Our infant mortality rate is higher than any of the other countries measured, too.</p> \n<p><img alt=""Infant_mortality"" class=""photo"" src=""http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/assets/4620059/infant_mortality.png""></p> \n<p>We're paying more for our health care but, at least on these three basic metrics, not getting better outcomes from our system.</p> \n<h3>One glimmer of good news: America ranks third on effective care</h3> \n<p>Not every part of the American health care system got a last-place ranking. The United States' best showing was in providing effective care, which is largely a measure of how well a health care system does following guidelines for appropriate care.</p> \n<p>American patients are the most likely to receive reminders about preventive care they need than any other country except the Netherlands. And American doctors are the most likely to talk to their patients about exercise and physical activity.</p> \n<p><img alt=""Effective_care"" class=""photo"" src=""http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/assets/4620131/effective_care.png"">The more effective care delivered in America doesn't seem to impact the outcomes measured in this particular survey, which are limited to life expectancy, infant mortality and preventable deaths. It's possible they might turn up in other metrics.</p> \n<p>And, its also possible the United States' ranking could change in future surveys. Numerous surveys show that the Affordable Care Act is driving down the uninsured rate, which could reduce the cost-barriers and inequality that shows up here. In upcoming surveys, America might not come in very last.</p>"

Singapore delivers better health care at lower costs than the U.S. Here's how.,http://www.vox.com/2014/6/17/5815468/singapore-delivers-better-health-care-at-lower-costs-than-the-u-s,Singapore's health care system is widely admired by experts. This video explains how it works.,"<p>Singapore is often held up as a shining example of what a health care system could be: it has much lower spending than the United States — about $2,000 per person in 2009 compared to the U.S.'s $7,000 — and better outcomes. In a frequently-cited World Health Organization study, Singapore ranked sixth among international health systems. The U.S. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization_ranking_of_health_systems_in_2000"">ranked 37th</a>.</p> \n<p>What makes Singapore's system tick? Aaron Carroll, director of the Center for Health Policy and Professionalism Research at Indiana University School of Medicine and blogger at <a href=""http://theincidentaleconomist.com/wordpress/"">The Incidental Economist</a>, lays it out in his latest episode of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCabaQPYxxKepWUsEVQMT4Kw"">Healthcare Triage</a>.</p> \n<p><iframe frameborder=""0"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/WtuXrrEZsAg"" height=""315"" width=""560""></iframe></p> \n<p>Singapore relies on some principles embraced by conservative health policy scholars — notably, savings accounts for paying out medical expenses. These are a popular health reform tactic with the GOP; the belief is that these accounts, paired with high deductibles, will make consumers more cost-conscious and smarter about how they spend money on medical care.<span> Health savings accounts have been embedded in </span><a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/medicaid-expansion-explained/which-states-are-changing-medicaid"">Medicaid expansions</a><span> in certain conservative-led states. </span></p> \n<p>But that's not the whole story. Unlike in the United States, Singapore mandates that people deposit money in their health savings account: from <a href=""https://www.moh.gov.sg/content/moh_web/home/costs_and_financing/schemes_subsidies/medisave.html"">7 to 9.5 percent</a> of income, depending on age. (Other mandatory and optional savings accounts consume additional income.)</p> \n<p>Singapore's system is also <a href=""http://theincidentaleconomist.com/wordpress/about-singapore-ctd-part-2/"">heavily regulated</a> by the public sector. Though only one-third of the country's health spending is public, the government takes a strong role to keep prices low.</p> \n<p>None of this is to say that Singapore's system is something that the United States could easily emulate — and it's wise to be wary of people who suggest otherwise, regardless of ideology.</p> \n<p>""<span>The most frustrating part about Singapore is that it's easily misused by those who want to see their own health care systems change,"" Carroll says. ""More conservative types will point to the Medisave accounts and the stress on individual contributions, but ignore the heavy government involvement and regulation. More liberal types will point to the public's ability to hold down costs and achieve quality, but ignore the class system or the system's reliance on individual decision-making."" </span></p>"

Twenty-somethings report better health and lower medical expenses under Obamacare,http://www.vox.com/2014/6/17/5817420/twenty-somethings-report-better-health-and-lower-medical-expenses,"Twenty-somethings are a healthy bunch, and they're feeling healthier under Obamacare.","<p><span>Young adults who gained coverage through Obamacare were more likely to report being in excellent health, according to a new </span><a href=""https://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=1881299"">research letter</a><span> in the Journal of the American Medical Association published Tuesday. </span></p> \n<p><span></span><span>But this didn't necessarily reflect the newly-insured — the under 26-year-olds who have been eligible to stay on their parents' plans since 2010 — going to the doctor more.

Many medical experts prior to the 1990s argued transgender status was an  untreatable mental health issue. But most medical experts today, including the <a href=""http://www.cnn.com/2012/12/02/health/new-mental-health-diagnoses/"">American Psychiatric Association</a>,  agree hormone therapy and sex-reassignment  surgery can treat gender dysphoria, when someone has significant discontent with the gender he or she was assigned at birth.</p> \n<p>""These trans bans have been frozen in time,"" says Joshua Block, an attorney at the ACLU LGBT Project. ""Across the board, it's a matter of getting agencies, including the Department of Defense, to view regulations concerning trans health care the same way they would view any other health-care regulation.""</p> \n<h3>The US military doesn't allow transgender soldiers to serve openly<br>\n</h3> \n<p>The repeal of Don't Ask, Don't Tell ended the ban on openly gay and lesbian soldiers. It did not, however, end discrimination against transgender soldiers, who are not currently allowed to serve openly in the US military.</p> \n<center> \n<p><img src=""http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/assets/4440459/transgender_soldiers_map.png"" class=""photo"" alt=""Transgender_soldiers_map""></p> \n</center> \n<p>As <a href=""http://www.palmcenter.org/files/Transgender%20Military%20Service%20Report.pdf"">a recent report</a> from the Palm Center explained, the ban allows commanders to dismiss transgender individuals from the military without a medical review, regardless of the soldier's ability to serve. As a result, transgender soldiers are forced to hide their true identities if they want to remain in the military.</p> \n<p>Given the ban, the institution won't cover transition-related care for transgender soldiers — even after other federal agencies have updated their policies.</p> \n<h3>The VA doesn't cover or perform sex-reassignment surgeries</h3> \n<center> \n<p><img alt=""492562971"" class=""photo"" src=""http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/assets/4632245/492562971.jpg""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Karen Bleier / AFP via Getty Images</p> \n</center> \n<p>The US Department of Veterans Affairs will, depending on a veteran's qualifications in the VA system, cover and perform <a href=""http://www.va.gov/vhapublications/ViewPublication.asp?pub_ID=2863"">some transgender care services</a>, with the major exception of sex-reassignment surgeries.</p> \n<p>The VA, for instance, will cover hormone therapy, mental health care, preoperative evaluation, and medically necessary post-operative and long-term care following sex-reassignment surgery.

Like other major employers, the military offers health coverage to its employees' — in this case, soldiers' — families. So the restriction on sex-reassignment surgery means a soldier's transgender spouse, sons, or daughters wouldn't be able to get care that much of the medical community considers legitimate and necessary.</p> \n<p>At the same time, TRICARE covers other controversial procedures if they're deemed medically necessary. Its health plans, for example, <a href=""http://www.tricare.mil/CoveredServices/SeeWhatsCovered/Abortions.aspx"">will cover abortions</a> if the pregnancy puts the life of the mother at risk or is the result of an act of rape or incest.</p> \n<p>There's not much movement yet, however, to change the transgender restrictions.

The marketplace is so well-liked that Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell now supports keeping Kynect around while calling for Obamacare's repeal (a proposal that, policy-wise, <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/5/29/5761140/mitch-mcconnell-repeal-obamacare-except-maybe-keep-everything-it-does"">would be nearly impossible to pull off</a>).</p> \n<p>Beshear visited Washington, D.C Tuesday to address Enroll America's conference on what worked during open enrollment. We spoke in his office about what worked in Kentucky, why he doesn't think other states will set up their own Obamacare exchanges and how long it will take other Southern governors to expand Medicaid. What follows is a transcript of our discussion, lightly edited for clarity and content.</p> \n<p><b style=""line-height: 1.5;"">Sarah Kliff: What was October 1 like for you guys in Kentucky? I know here in DC we had a government shutdown starting and a health care website that didn't work.</b></p> \n<p>Gov. Steve Beshear: There had been an extreme amount of effort put in for months. All of our folks had been planning for the rollout of the Affordable Care Act, planning the website, organizing connectors, doing educational outreach. There were thousands of people involved all during the spring and summer working on different aspects of that.</p> \n<p><q class=""center"" aria-hidden=""true"">'when october 1 rolled around we crossed our fingers, said a little prayer and hoped for the best.'</q></p> \n<p>One of the key decisions we made looking back on it was we didn't require people to register and sign-in before they could browse our website. You could go on and plug your numbers in and see what kind of subsidy you're going to get. The federal website was set up where everyone had to sign in first, and that just created a bottleneck.</p> \n<p>All that work went in and then, quite honestly, at midnight when October 1 rolled around, we crossed our fingers, said a little prayer and hoped for the best. Fortunately, it worked. All that hard work paid off and it was, by noon, an avalanche of people. For the first couple of weeks, it was just amazing.</p> \n<p><b>SK: Did you see Kentucky becoming a national success story and model? I know going into open enrollment, you had Maryland and California talking about how they were doing the best work. Is this the role you expected Kentucky to play in the Obamacare roll out?</b></p> \n<p>SB: That idea wasn't even on our radar screen at the time. We were working hard to make sure that everything worked, but we had no idea that we would be one of the few whose website would actually work when we started. All at once, we were a national model because we were working with ease.</p> \n<p>Obviously, the federal government website had such problems and when you look back on it, hindsight is 20/20, I'm sure when they started they're planning they never thought in their wildest dreams that they would have 34 or 35 states to run. I'm sure their idea going in was there will be a few that will just take the federal exchange, but most will do their exchange. They don't want the federal government to do this, they want to do it for themselves - that's the way Kentucky thought. They ended up having to deal with 35 sets of insurance laws. It got very complicated very fast.</p> \n<p><b>SK: Do you expect more states will run their own exchanges in the future, or this open enrollment really just underscored how difficult it is to launch these marketplaces?</b></p> \n<p><q class=""right"" aria-hidden=""true"">'My guess is you won't see a lot of states opting into' building exchanges</q></p> \n<p>SB: The experience so far would seem to indicate that now that the federal exchange is up and running...and with the problems some states have had that tried to do local exchanges and the vendors who didn't work, my guess is you'll see states mostly allowing the federal government to do it. Some of the states that are rebooting are going to have spend considerably more money to get it done. My guess is you won't see a lot of states opting into that.</p> \n<p>What I do think you'll see in the next two to four years is states opting into Medicaid expansions.</p> \n<p><b>SK: How do you see that issue playing out in the South? I know Sen. Vitter said yesterday he was open to the idea in Louisiana, which seemed like quite a shift for the state.</b></p> \n<p>SB: Before I made the decision to expand Medicaid, I wanted an answer to the question of whether we could afford to do so. It's easy to determine its the right thing to do, if you can do it without bankrupting the state. I brought PriceWaterhouseCooper in and they did that study for us that indicated that not only can you afford it, but you really can't afford not to. This is a positive economic impact on your state for the next five to ten years.</p> \n<p>I think what you're going to see in a lot of these states where its been a political football that sooner or later most of these states are going to go ahead and opt into this. We get folks from Tennessee and some of the surrounding states that haven't done this, and are in Kentucky, and they see what's happening. They see their family or friends who live in Kentucky all at once have affordable health care, or qualify for Medicaid, and they can't get it. I think that sentiment will start growing and most these states will be forced to move on and get into expanded Medicaid.</p> \n<p><b>SK: When you look at somewhere like Texas, where Gov. Perry has taken a very strong stance against this, do you think there's also a two to four year timeline for the state expanding? </b></p> \n<p><q class=""left"" aria-hidden=""true"">'i do think, you'll see in the next two to four years states opting into Medicaid expansions.'</q></p> \n<p>SB: Who knows. I would never predict anything about Texas but I think for a good number of states that have yet to do it I think you will see it happen. As the political firestorm that we've had for the last six years, as we move hopefully a little bit beyond that in the next three or four years, I think it will be more palatable for some of the Republican governors to go ahead and do what they really should do and find a way to expand Medicaid. They may talk about it in a different way, may try to put different terms on it, but at the end they're denying a significant portion of their population affordable health coverage.</p> \n<p><b>SK: Was the Medicaid expansion a difficult thing to do as an executive action? Would you have preferred to do it with the support of the legislature?</b></p> \n<p>SB: No. Once I got the report from PriceWaterhouseCooper that demonstrated we could afford to go in that direction I was proud to make the decision. I was proud to have the executive branch write that regulation to expand Medicaid, because its the right thing to do. Once I found out I could afford it, it was an easy decision.</p> \n<p><b>SK: On Kynect, I know Sen. McConnell has made some comments about the idea that we should repeal Obamacare, but definitely keep Kynect. Can you talk a little bit about, if Obamacare is repealed, what happens to Kynect?</b></p> \n<p>SB: If Obamacare is repealed, there's not going to be any Kynect. First of all, if you repeal Obamacare, your folks with pre-existing conditions won't be able to get coverage. Kids won't be able to stay on their parents' policies until they're 26. Women will go back to having to pay more for the same insurance. There's all kinds of things the Affordable Care Act has done to change the landscape that will disappear and that's part of what Kynect is based on, all of those assumptions.</p> \n<p><q class=""center"" aria-hidden=""true"">repealing obamacare would be 'a total DISMANTLEMENT of kynect'</q></p> \n<p>The second thing is expanded Medicaid is gone. If the federal government is not going to pay for expanded Medicaid, certainly the state can't pay for it. Third, all the premium subsidies will go away. So there won't be a lot of people who can afford the qualified health plans.</p> \n<p>It'll be a total dismantlement of Kynect. And, the real consequence is the 421,000 Kentuckians buying affordable health insurance won't have it. I'll submit to you that's why Sen. McConnell is tap-dancing on this issue and trying to play both sides of it.</p> \n<p><b>SK: Could you keep running any sort of marketplace, or would there be any point without the Affordable Care Act?</b></p> \n<p>SB: There wouldn't be any point. You already had a marketplace for individual health insurance companies to come into the state and market their policies and really the reason for that marketplace disappears when you don't have the subsidies that come along with it, and there are no requirements for essential benefits. You would just be right back where we were before the Affordable Care Act passed.</p> \n<p><b>SK: Do you think there's a point where Obamacare and Kynect become more equally-popular in your state, or will there always be this disconnect where Kynect is better liked?</b></p> \n<p>SB: I think down the road it will all even out. This whole Affordable Care Act issue has been very partisan issue since the president proposed it. This will be his legacy. He will go down in history as the president who brought affordable health care to most Americans. That's a great legacy to have. It'll be the first major change since Medicare in the 1960s. And I would submit to you that 20 years from now, people will be looking at it like Medicare. It will be part of the fabric of our society and it will not be a hot button for anybody. If I had to guess, I'd think the president doesn't mind it being called Obamacare because he's going to be known for it and get the credit for it in the long term.</p>"
"Obamacare's sticker shock is real, but it's not as bad as advertised",http://www.vox.com/2014/6/18/5818988/obamacares-sticker-shock-is-real-but-its-not-as-bad-as-advertised,"Yes, Obamacare caused insurance prices to rise. No, it's not as bad as you think.","<p>What did the Affordable Care Act really do to the cost of health insurance? The question is harder to answer than it sounds.</p> \n<p>A <a href=""http://www.nber.org/papers/w20223"">new study</a> published this week in the National Bureau of Economic Research is arguably the best effort to date. The study, conducted by one of the top-regarded health economists,  suggests that the law did create some modest ""sticker shock"" for those buying their own coverage.</p> \n<p>But that's also before taking subsidies into account, and it's mostly because insurers anticipated that their enrollees would be sicker — and thus, more expensive — after Obamacare.</p> \n<h3>Obamacare upended the individual insurance market</h3> \n<p>The populations that bought health insurance before Obamacare — and those that purchased health insurance afterwards — are incredibly different. So are the insurance plans themselves.</p> \n<p>Before the ACA, health plans had tons of discretion on what they could offer as health insurance — and who they would let purchase their products. In most states, insurers charged sick enrollees higher premiums than healthy people — or worse, insurers could deny them health coverage altogether.</p> \n<p>Obamacare changed the individual market in at least two major ways. First, it required insurers to accept all customers and not charge them different rates based on their health status.</p> \n<p>Second, it also required insurers to cover a suite of ""essential health benefits,"" which includes ten broad categories like hospital visits and preventive care. The essential health benefits include some medical services, like maternity care, that some individual market plans often left off because it drove up premium rates.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""right"">early attempts to estimate ""sticker shock"" were messy. </q></p> \n<p>Letting sick people into the market and increasing the number of benefits that insurers have to cover are both changes that could drive up prices for those who were already buying insurance prior to Obamacare.</p> \n<p>What the new paper from University of Pennsylvania's Mark Pauly attempts to do is figure out how much, exactly, Obamacare changed prices for existing consumers — and what specifically drove those changes.</p> \n<p><a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/theapothecary/2013/05/30/rate-shock-in-california-obamacare-to-increase-individual-insurance-premiums-by-64-146/"" style=""line-height: 1.5;"">Early attempts</a> to estimate Obamacare's ""sticker shock"" were messy.  They often looked at some of the cheapest plans that were available prior to health reform; those cheap plans were often less comprehensive that today's exchange plans — they could cover far fewer benefits, so comparing them didn't make much sense.</p> \n<p>More comprehensive care is not without value. ""Any analysis of the change in premiums should at least recognize that more comprehensive coverage pays for more medical costs,"" Pauly — a conservative — writes.</p> \n<h3>Total insurance costs probably went up by 14 to 28 percent on average, before subsidies.</h3> \n<p>There is a national survey conducted each year that collects information about how much people spend annually on health care, counting both monthly premiums and out-of-pocket expenses (like the deductible and co-payments required at doctor's visits). The authors used that — along with information like age and sex — to figure out how health reform changed the cost of insurance. The authors focused on California and the states who opted to use Healthcare.gov, instead of setting up their own exchange.</p> \n<p><q class=""center"" aria-hidden=""true"">""this is not as large as estimates from opponents of the aca, but is likely to represent a moderate increase on average."" </q></p> \n<p>Overall, they found that total insurance costs — including premiums and any out-of-pocket spending — went up between 14 and 28 percent as a result of the Affordable Care Act. Before subsidies, this translates to an average monthly increase of $58 to $118, depending on the type of plan (bronze or silver).</p> \n<p>According to the authors, this change ""is not as large as many of the <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/special-report/2014/obamacare_map/index.html#"">estimates from opponents of the ACA</a>, but is very likely to represent a moderate increase on average if former buyers choose the lowest premium options in exchanges.""</p> \n<h3>Why did the cost of insurance go up?</h3> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""right"">THE CHANGE IN WHO'S ENROLLING IN INSURANCE — NOT THE RICHNESS OF THOSE BENEFITS — is DRIVING THE RISE IN PRICES.</q></p> \n<p>On balance, the authors suggest that the hike is attributable to insurers expecting an influx of sicker enrollees. Health reform makes insurance easier to obtain for sick people. The new insurance rules means that cost gets spread around across the sick and the healthy, so when enrollees get sicker overall, prices go up for everyone.</p> \n<p><span>The other factor that might have driven up prices — the essential benefits package — doesn't seem to have played a major role. This new paper finds that the generosity of the insurance benefits offered before Obamacare was roughly similar, on average, to the medium-level plans on today's exchanges. And that suggests the change in who's enrolling in insurance — not the richness of those insurance benefits — is driving the rise in prices.</span></p> \n<h3>The federal subsidies matter a lot</h3> \n<p>This particular paper paper doesn't consider the impact of subsidies, though — and, according to newly-released HHS data, about 87 percent of individuals shopping on Healthcare.gov are receiving these subsidies. Among subsidized singles, the average monthly premium is just <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/6/18/5818386/heres-how-much-people-are-paying-for-obamacare"">$82</a>.</p> \n<p><img alt=""Average_monthly_premium"" class=""photo"" src=""http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/assets/4632059/average_monthly_premium.png""> <br id=""1403106819601""></p> \n<p>The climb in prices is smaller than previously anticipated by Obamacare's detractors — smaller, even, than findings in a report <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/special-report/2013/what-will-obamacare-cost-you-map.html"">released Wednesday</a> by the conservative Manhattan Institute, which alleges an average rate increase of 49 percent. <span>Narrower analyses, and stories trotted out in the media, are likely to paint different pictures. But they won't be representative of the big picture, as Pauly's study aspires to be. </span></p> \n<p>Subsidies should blunt the price increase for a majority of enrollees. However, the minority of Healthcare.gov shoppers who don't receive subsidies — and those who purchase insurance outside state exchanges, where subsidies can't be applied — are more vulnerable to the changes.</p>"

If someone had been watching over the Phoenix VA facility all along, there's a good chance the nefarious scheme could have been prevented or stopped.</p> \n<p>Part of the problem, of course, also lies in the perverse incentive created by the VA's wait time goals. Once local VA hospitals realized they couldn't hit the 14-day wait time goal set by federal rules due to rising patient demand and a doctor shortage, many of them resorted to cheating on scheduling records to continue getting their pay bonuses. If the pay bonuses never created an unrealistic goal, the record falsification wouldn't have been incentivized.</p> \n<p>One of Gibson's <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/6/6/5785912/va-takes-first-steps-to-address-scandal"">first actions</a> after he replaced former VA Secretary Eric Shinseki was to repeal the 14-day wait time goal. The idea, as emphasized in <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/6/9/5793794/full-va-audit-highlights-perverse-incentives"">the VA's own audit</a>, is to do away with the perverse incentive created by the scheduling goal.</p> \n<p>Given that both these fixes just required a new VA leader to make regulatory changes, it's questionable that it took a scandal to actually address such serious problems.

"Halbig: Obamacare's big, new legal challenge, explained",http://www.vox.com/2014/7/22/5821600/obamacare-halbig-subsidies-illegal-most-states,This little-known lawsuit is Obamacare's biggest threat.,"<p>Halbig v. Burwell is arguably the Affordable Care Act's greatest existential threat since the Supreme Court case decided in 2012. But the administration just got a bit of good news: the decision issued by the DC Circuit  in July might be overturned this fall.</p> \n<p>In the Halbig case, the DC Circuit ruled that Obamacare's subsidies were illegal in 36 states. And without subsidies, health reform could fall apart. That makes this court case a bigger deal than GOP efforts to repeal Obamacare. There have been over 40 repeal votes since the law was passed, but they've always been toothless: even if repeal made it through Congress, President Obama promised to veto any legislation that dismantled his signature legislation.</p> \n<h3>What is the case?</h3> \n<p>Three employers and four taxpayers (the plaintiffs) are suing the federal government over Obamacare.</p> \n<p>The suit alleges that subsidies should <i>only </i>be available in states that set up their own insurance exchanges, based on the text of the Affordable Care Act. The government can still appeal, but if it ultimately loses the case at the Supreme Court, it's possible that federal subsidies will no longer be available to help make insurance affordable in over thirty states.</p> \n<p>Due to what <a href=""http://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20140614/MAGAZINE/306149796&amp;utm_source=AltURL&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=am?AllowView=VXQ0UnpwZTVEUFdhL1I3TkErT1lBajNja0U4VURPZFpFQjBKQWc9PQ==&amp;mh"">appears to many outside observers</a> to have been poorly-crafted legislative language, Congress wrote a sentence that <span>arguably </span><span>provides subsidies exclusively to state-based exchanges and not to federally-facilitated ones, even while subjectively </span><i style=""line-height: 1.5;"">intending</i><span> to provide subsidies in both cases.

Sebelius. Sylvia Burwell recently succeeded Kathleen Sebelius as </span><span>Secretary of Health and Human Services, </span><span>so the case has been renamed Halbig v. Burwell.</span></p> \n<h3>Why is this case such a big deal?</h3> \n<p>In Obamacare's first year, 36 states defaulted to Healthcare.gov, the federally-coordinated exchange. An estimated <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/6/18/5818386/heres-how-much-people-are-paying-for-obamacare"">87 percent</a> of individuals who enrolled through the website are receiving subsidies — the precise subsidies that this court case calls into question.</p> \n<p class=""caption""><img src=""http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/assets/4677009/state_health_insurance_exchange_decisions.png"" class=""photo"" alt=""State_health_insurance_exchange_decisions"">(Note: Though initially intending to set up state exchanges, Idaho and New Mexico defaulted to Healthcare.gov bringing the total number of federally-facilitated and partnership marketplaces to 36, not 34.)</p> \n<p><span>The success of the Affordable Care Act hinges crucially on the subsidies. The primary purpose of the law was to extend affordable health coverage to millions of Americans; the two main ways the law </span><a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/obamacare/what-does-obamacare-do"">achieves this</a><span> is through the Medicaid expansion and through subsidized coverage on the insurance exchanges.</span></p> \n<p><span>Without subsidies, private insurance become unaffordable for many people who have already enrolled.</span><span> </span>The judicial process is still playing out, but according to <a href=""http://www.rwjf.org/content/dam/farm/reports/issue_briefs/2014/rwjf414644"">recent analysis</a> from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, this decision could affect over 7.3 million people expected to receive federal subsidies in 2016.</p> \n<p>If the plaintiffs prevail and subsidies are withdrawn, healthy people would drop their coverage, and only the people who are very sick — and therefore very expensive to insure — would keep their plans.</p> \n<p>This sets up the classic insurance ""death spiral"". By putting coverage out of financial reach for so many people, it would undermine the entire purpose of the Affordable Care Act.</p> \n<h3>Why is the DC Circuit's decision to hear the case ""en banc"" so important?</h3> \n<p style=""font-size: 15.5555562973022px;"">On July 22, the US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit issued a ruling against the federal government that threatens health insurance subsidies in over 30 states. The government entered a request to have the case taken ""en banc,"" meaning a 13-judge panel will rehear the case. This panel could overturn the decision issued by the three judges initially drawn to hear the case.</p> \n<p style=""font-size: 15.5555562973022px;"">The larger panel is populated primarily with judges  appointed by Democrats: there are eight of them, compared to five appointed by Republicans. The three-judge panel that originally heard Halbig tipped conservative, with two Republican-appointed judges.</p> \n<p style=""font-size: 15.5555562973022px;"">Liberal and conservative judges approach the law from different perspective, which can yield different outcomes. This is evident from the ruling in King v. Burwell, a case proceeding on the same issue in the US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.

Fourteen states and DC established ""state-based"" exchanges, which give them more flexibility and authority in controlling their Obamacare markets.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""right"">the plaintiffs argue that subsidies are only available on state-based exchanges</q></p> \n<p>In the event that a state chose not to establish its own exchange, the Affordable Care Act dictates that the federal government would step in and create a ""federally-facilitated"" exchange. There's also a middle ground for partnership exchanges, where states and feds share authority. <span>Healthcare.gov is the face of </span><span>federally-facilitated and partnership exchanges.</span></p> \n<p>These different types of exchanges were set up by different parts of the health law. <span>But the part of the Affordable Care Act that authorizes the subsidies specifies that those subsidies are available to people </span><span>""enrolled in through an Exchange established by the State under 1311"" — the section that sets up <i>state-based</i> exchanges.</span></p> \n<p>Because it's written that way, the plaintiffs argue that subsidies are <i style=""line-height: 1.5;"">only</i><span> available</span><i style=""line-height: 1.5;""> </i><span>on</span><i style=""line-height: 1.5;""> </i><span>state-based exchanges, not on the Healthcare.gov exchanges used by the majority of states.</span></p> \n<h3>Why would the law prohibit states from getting subsidies unless they set up their own exchange?</h3> \n<p>To be clear, the administration is arguing that the law doesn't do this at all.</p> \n<p>But the plaintiffs claim that the subsidies — in addition to making insurance more affordable for millions of Americans — were supposed to act as a carrot, encouraging states to set up their own exchanges. If a state set up its own exchange, its citizens would receive subsidies. If the state didn't, its citizens wouldn't.</p> \n<h3><span>What's the government's defense?</span></h3> \n<p>The government's primary defense hinges on a single word.</p> \n<p>Word choice carries a lot of weight in legal interpretation. The part of the Affordable Care Act that creates federally-facilitated exchanges says that when a state doesn't set up its own marketplace, the federal government ""shall establish and  operate such exchange"". According to the administration, the word ""such"" implies that federal exchanges effectively step into the shoes of state exchanges.</p> \n<p>Furthermore, the government argues, if it <i>isn't </i>obvious that the law intends federally-facilitated exchanges be functionally equivalent to state exchanges, then the law is at least ambiguous on the point.</p> \n<p>You can't examine the part of the statute that sets up federally-facilitated exchanges in isolation; you have to look at it in the broader context of the reform law. Since affordable coverage is a core tenet of the law, to say that people in state and federal exchanges aren't equally entitled to tax credits would set the law at <a href=""http://balkin.blogspot.com/2012/11/a-rejoinder-to-michael-cannon-re.html"">war with itself</a>. That could be enough to call it ambiguous on its face.<span> </span></p> \n<p>When a law is ambiguous, the courts defer to the interpretation of the agency responsible for implementation. Obviously implementation has moved forward under the assumption that residents of every state are entitled to subsidies, regardless of what kind of exchange the state uses.</p> \n<h3><span>What do we actually know about what Congress intended?</span></h3> \n<p>The early bills that eventually became the Affordable Care Act were <a href=""http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=122476051"">conflicted</a> about whether exchanges should be coordinated at the state or federal level — the House bill called for a national marketplace, the Senate bill for state exchanges. But few legal scholars or health reform spectators lend credence to the claim that Congress intended to tie subsidies exclusively to state exchanges in the final legislation.</p> \n<p>""No sentient being following the health care debate could argue, in good faith, that Obamacare’s architects intended for the federal government to set up exchanges without subsidies,"" <a href=""http://www.newrepublic.com/blog/plank/110322/obamacare-oklahoma-lawsuit-federal-exchange-subsidies-cannon"">wrote</a> Jonathan Cohn in 2012. ""It would completely subvert the law's intent.""</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""center"">""no sentient being could argue, in good faith, that Obamacare's architects intended for the federal government to set up exchanges without subsidies""</q></p> \n<p>Cohn, who closely tracked the health reform debate for over a year before the Affordable Care Act was passed, echoed his point earlier this month.</p> \n<p>""Not once in the 16 months I reported on the formal congressional debate did any of the law's architects suggest they were thinking along these lines, he <a href=""http://www.newrepublic.com/article/118697/facts-about-new-lawsuits-against-obamacare-they-rewrite-history"">writes</a>. ""It wouldn’t make sense in the context of the law, which depends upon those subsidies to accomplish its primary goal. It's why assessments of Obamacare’s impact, including those from the Congressional Budget Office, assumed that residents of all states would have access to the tax credits.""</p> \n<p>Compare this to the Medicaid expansion: as the Affordable Care Act was originally written, states needed to expand the program or forfeit all federal Medicaid funding. This incensed conservative states. It incensed them so much that they brought a lawsuit against the federal government, claiming that expansion requirements were coercive — a lawsuit they won.</p> \n<p>None of the states made noises suggesting that the law coerced them into building their own exchanges. ""<span>There was not a breath during the legislative debate suggesting that Congress meant to deprive citizens in states with federally-facilitated exchanges of tax credits,"" said Nicholas Bagley, a law professor at the University of Michigan. </span></p> \n<h3>What's next for the case?</h3> \n<p>Subsidies aren't going anywhere — yet.</p> \n<p>The initial Halbig decision comes from three judges on the DC Circuit. The government asked the entire DC Circuit — 13 judges in total — to review the decision ""en banc"" — a request that was granted. The court skews to the left (there are eight Democratic appointees and only five Republican appointees) which bodes in the administration's favor. The en banc arguments are scheduled for December 17.</p> \n<p>And the Supreme Court may or may not decide to hear the case in the future.</p> \n<p>Plaintiffs in King v. Burwell, the case where the Fourth Circuit upheld subsidies, have appealed to the high court, but there's a good chance that the  justices will wait until the en banc rehearing plays out with Halbig before deciding whether or not to take up King.</p> \n<p>When a ""circuit split"" exists — where two federal appeals courts disagree about the same legal challenge — there's a pressing reason for Supreme Court review, which makes it more likely. But when the court decisions don't contradict each other, the Supreme Court is less likely to get involved, unless they decide that there are ""<a href=""http://theincidentaleconomist.com/wordpress/will-the-supreme-court-grant-king-v-burwell/"">profound</a>"" consequences at stake.</p> \n<p>Whether or not the Supremes will take up the subsidies challenge remains to be seen.</p>"

A quick run-down:</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""right"">each survey happened at a different time with different people asked different questions</q></p> \n<p>The <a href=""http://healthcare.mckinsey.com/sites/default/files/McKinsey%20Reform%20Center_Individual%20Market%20Post%20OEP%20Trends.pdf"">McKinsey report</a>, conducted during the second week of April, used a non-random sample of people who buy insurance on the individual market and elected to be part of an online survey. It found that a much-smaller 24 percent of exchange enrollees were uninsuredwhen they signed up.</p> \n<p>To measure who had coverage, McKinsey asked people to identify the insurance they had ""most of the year"" in 2013. This would mean that an Obamacare enrollee who, for example, lost their employer coverage in August and bought an exchange plan in December would be counted as someone who did have previous coverage.</p> \n<p>The<a href=""http://www.rand.org/blog/2014/04/survey-estimates-net-gain-of-9-3-million-american-adults.html""> RAND estimate </a>relies on the research firm's ongoing American Life Panel, a set group of people who it regularly asks different research questions. Since November, RAND has asked this group about its health insurance status. It found that, when it reached out to them mostly in early March, that 36 percent of those who had exchange coverage were, in earlier surveys, uninsured.</p> \n<p>RAND collected most of its enrollment data before the big sign-up surge in late March and early April. Researchers note in their report ""some may have made new insurance choices <span>since participating in our survey."" </span></p> \n<p>Health and Human Services has<a href=""http://aspe.hhs.gov/health/reports/2014/MarketPlaceEnrollment/Apr2014/ib_2014Apr_enrollment.pdf""> estimated </a>87 percent of certain Obamacare enrollees lacked coverage when they signed up. This figure comes from a question on Healthcare.gov, that the federal government required any shopper applying for subsidies to answer. Since the vast majority of shoppers did apply for subsidy, 5.18 million people answered this question — and only 13 percent indicated they had insurance at the time they were filling out the application. This figure misses anyone who bought coverage on a state exchange, and those who did not apply for subsidies.</p> \n<p>Last, there's <a href=""http://kff.org/private-insurance/report/survey-of-non-group-health-insurance-enrollees"">the new Kaiser Family Foundation report</a>. It uses a random sample of 742 people who bought a plan on an Obamacare exchange (either Healthcare.gov or one of the state-run marketplaces). It asked survey respondents this question: ""Before you began coverage under your current health insurance plan, were you covered by a different plan you <span>purchased yourself, were you covered by an employer, by COBRA, did you have Medicaid or other public coverage, or were you </span><span>uninsured?""</span></p> \n<h3>Which number is right?</h3> \n<p>No survey has gone out and measured all 8 million Obamacare enrollees, asking each and everyone whether they had health insurance coverage when they bought a plan on the marketplace.</p> \n<p>The new Kaiser Family Foundation survey is the most up-to-date, randomized study that specifically asks people to identify what coverage source they had prior to signing up on the exchange.</p> \n<p><q class=""center"" aria-hidden=""true"">the new kaiser study is the most up-to-date, randomized study of who bought coverage</q></p> \n<p>This separates it from RAND (whose survey data misses the end of open enrollment), McKinsey (which asks a slightly different question) and the Obama administration estimate (it leaves out anyone buying through a state exchange).</p> \n<p>Will the Kaiser survey be the last word? Probably not: given all the variation in estimates, this is an area that political pundits will keep debating and health researchers will keep researching. Measuring health insurance status is tricky; depending on how pollsters phrase questions, it can change whether people say they have coverage. But the Kaiser numbers are, at this point, a pretty decent gauge of who exactly signed up for coverage, and what their situation was beforehand.</p> \n<h3>Further reading</h3> \n<p> \n</p>\n<ul> \n<li><span><a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/6/12/5785864/8-million-how-obamacare-met-its-enrollment-goal"">Eight million</a>: How Obamacare met its enrollment goal</span></li> \n<li><span>How<a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/6/8/5789350/how-connecticut-built-a-healthcare-gov-that-actually-works""> Connecticut</a> built a healthcare.gov that actually worked</span></li> \n<li><span>The uninsured rate has<a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/6/5/5782320/the-uninsured-rate-has-plummeted-since-obamacare-kicked-in""> plummeted </a>since 2013</span></li> \n<li>\n<span>One in five Americans is now on </span><a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/6/4/5780024/one-in-five-americans-are-now-on-medicaid"">Medicaid</a>\n</li> \n</ul> \n"

The ruling allows some for-profit corporations to provide insurance that doesn't cover birth control, essentially opting out of Obamacare's mandate.</p> \n<p>In the short-term, political efforts will surely focus on <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/6/30/5857634/alito-gave-obama-some-advice-on-guaranteeing-contraceptive-coverage/in/5621013"">bridging the coverage gap</a> created by the decision. <span>But in the long term, advocates for access to contraception should turn to something else: making birth control available over the counter. </span></p> \n<h3>1. Birth control is safe.</h3> \n<p class=""caption""><img src=""http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/assets/4655303/57083359.jpg"" class=""photo"" alt=""57083359"">(Tim Boyle/Getty Images News)</p> \n<p><span>""Oral contraceptives have been out for many, many years in this country.

But pregnancy itself comes with blood clot risk that's twice as high as the risk associated with contraceptives.</span></p> \n<p>Health risks are higher among certain women — those who are obese or who smoke, for example. Doctors and pharmacists believe that women are capable of self-screening for risk factors, and <a href=""http://www.acog.org/Resources_And_Publications/Committee_Opinions/Committee_on_Gynecologic_Practice/Over_the_Counter_Access_to_Oral_Contraceptives"">they have data</a> to back them up.</p> \n<h3>2.

That's a solid strategy for improving access, but it may not be enough: multiple factors influence whether a woman has access to contraception, and affordability is only one of them.</p> \n<p>If a woman is unable to schedule a doctor's appointment - she can't get the time off of work, or find a babysitter, or she doesn't have access to a car or other transportation - that's a barrier to birth control, because a prescription is required to get the pill. Making insurance more generous can't fix that.</p> \n<p>One of the primary problems with oral contraceptives is the ""drop-out"" rate. Women receive birth control and start taking it, but the need to fill a prescription every month (or every several months) and to get the prescription renewed after a year leads to women abandoning the pill — and may have more unintended pregnancies as a result.</p> \n<p>Allowing women to buy birth control at the pharmacy without a prescription would broaden access. Drugstores typically keep longer hours than clinics and doctor offices, and they're often more conveniently located, too.</p> \n<h3>3.

But last week, Rep. Cory Gardner, a GOP Congressman running for Senate in Colorado, also <a href=""http://www.denverpost.com/opinion/ci_25995739/women-should-be-able-buy-pill-without-prescription"">penned a column </a>in support of making birth control accessible over the counter.</p> \n<p>""Fewer unneeded doctors' appointments mean fewer missed workdays and child-care expenses, more productivity and more time with family,"" Gardner writes. ""With over 50,000 pharmacies in America and no appointment required, the increase in convenience and access would aid every adult woman who uses oral contraceptives, whether it's the first time they get them or when they run out and need a refill far from home.""</p> \n<p>Among Republicans, over-the-counter birth control is seen as a palatable alternative to requiring employers and insurers to include contraceptives in their benefits — something that would stand in for the contraceptive mandate. But the existence of the contraceptive mandate doesn't change the merit of over-the-counter birth control policy.</p> \n<h3>5.

Healthier enrollees should keep rate hikes small</h3> \n<p><span>The people who enroll in health insurance in future years are </span><a href=""http://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/attachments/45396-QFR-SBC.pdf"">expected</a><span> to be healthier than the people enrolled today. The penalty for not carrying insurance is modest this year: $95 or 1 percent of income for an individual, whichever's higher. That gets scaled up over the next few years, compelling more people to purchase insurance.</span></p> \n<p><span></span>The people who declined to sign up for insurance — and pay the penalty instead — are probably healthy; had they been uninsured and sick, they would have taken advantage of new coverage options under Obamacare. As these healthier people enroll in coverage, the average health of the insured population gets better, and insurance gets cheaper.</p> \n<h3>2. More insurer competition should stabilize prices</h3> \n<p><span>Some insurers decided to sit out the first year of health reform, but more </span><span>are joining the Obamacare game in 2015. That competition between insurers should also hold premiums down: </span><span>according to </span><a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/5/20/5734534/the-best-evidence-yet-obamacare-competition-lowers-premiums"">research</a><span> by economists Leemore Dafny, Jonathan Gruber and Christopher Oby, if all major insurers participated in the state exchanges, rates could fall as much as 11.1 percent. </span></p> \n<h3>3. The slowdown in health spending growth is good news for insurance premiums</h3> \n<p>The cost of medical services outpaces the cost of everything else, so the price of health insurance climbs year after year.</p> \n<p>But we've had some good news about health care inflation. <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/6/15/5807046/orszag-its-time-for-some-optimism-about-health-care-spending"">According to Peter Orszag</a>, former director of the Congressional Budget Office and Office of Budget and Management, the growth of health care prices has slowed tremendously, which means that insurance premiums — while we still expect them to rise — may not go up as fast as they used to.</p> \n<h3>4. But doctors could demand higher payments next year</h3> \n<p>The Congressional Budget Office <a href=""http://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/attachments/45396-QFR-SBC.pdf"">hypothesized</a> that strain on ""narrow networks"" could cause premiums <span>on the state exchanges </span><span>to go up. </span><span>Right now, insurers have been able to contain the cost of premiums by creating small networks of doctors for their enrollees to visit. Doctor visits are only covered when enrollees visit a doctor within one of those networks </span><span>— this means less choice, but lower prices</span><span>. </span></p> \n<p><span>As enrollment increases, though, health care providers will be more in demand. This means they'll be able to negotiate higher reimbursements for their services. Higher payments to providers require higher payments for health insurance.</span></p> \n<h3>5. Local conditions will vary</h3> \n<p>Insurance premiums are set at the local level, and insurers operate differently across different states. That means there there<span> will be enormous state variation in how premiums change. </span><span>In 2010, for example, </span><a href=""http://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/issue-briefs/2014/jun/health-insurance-premiums"" style=""line-height: 1.5; background-color: #ffffff;"">average rate increases</a><span> varied from 3 percent in Idaho to 21.8 percent in Nebraska, a difference of more than seven-fold. </span></p> \n<p><span></span><span>We're still waiting to hear about premiums from a majority of states, so we don't have the whole picture yet. </span><span>But, so far, it looks like next year's premiums are totally in line with expectations.</span></p>"
These 7 major cities are losing out on a big part of Obamacare,http://www.vox.com/2014/6/19/5824404/these-7-major-cities-are-losing-out-on-a-big-part-of-obamacare,Major cities could decrease their uninsured rates by a lot more if their states expanded Medicaid.,"<p>If Georgia expanded Medicaid, Atlanta's uninsured rate would fall by more than 56 percent under Obamacare.</p> \n<p>But Georgia isn't expanding Medicaid.

Seven cities that aren't in Medicaid expansion states, meanwhile, are decreasing the number of uninsured by just 30 percent.</p> \n<center> \n<p><img src=""http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/assets/4640195/medicaid_expansion_map.jpg"" class=""photo"" alt=""Medicaid_expansion_map""></p> \n</center> \n<p>The cities analyzed: Los Angeles, Chicago, Phoenix, Columbus, Detroit, Seattle, and Denver on the expansion side, and Houston, Philadelphia, Indianapolis, Charlotte, Memphis, Atlanta, and Miami on the non-expansion side.</p> \n<p>The Urban Institute estimates that if Medicaid were to expand in the seven non-expansion cities, the number of uninsured would instead fall by an average of 52 percent. In other words, the number of uninsured could decrease by an additional 22 percentage points if these cities' states accepted the <a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/obamacare"">Obamacare</a>-funded Medicaid expansion.</p> \n<p>Whether that will happen in more conservative states, particularly in <a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/south-obamacare-medicaid/the-south-needs-obamacare-the-most"">the South</a>, is very much an open question.

There's a bipartisan plan to fix part of Obamacare. Really.,http://www.vox.com/2014/6/20/5825230/theres-a-bipartisan-plan-to-fix-part-of-obamacare-really,Four senators have a strategy to stop Obamacare from punishing hospitals that serve the poor.,"<p dir=""ltr""><span>A bipartisan group of legislators is working together on Obamacare — not trying to repeal it, but trying to make the law work a little bit better.</span></p> \n<p dir=""ltr"">On Thursday, four Senators — two Republicans and two Democrats — introduced legislation that would tweak an Obamacare program that is meant to improve patients' medical care, but, according to recent research, might actually be making things <i>worse </i>for low-income patients.</p> \n<p dir=""ltr"">It's hard to know now whether this change will get any traction or, <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/5/21/5738438/what-schoolhouse-rock-left-out"">like the majority of bills right now</a>, get trapped in the political process. Still, its a notable moment for the health care law, with Senators from both political parties making an apparently good faith effort to fix something in the law that doesn't seem to be working quite right.</p> \n<h3><span>The problem: Obamacare punishes hospitals that serve the poor</span></h3> \n<p dir=""ltr""><span>The reform law tries to reduce avoidable hospitalizations, situations where patients turn up at the hospital a second time because something went wrong in their first trip. Under Obamacare, the government now penalizes hospitals when patients are readmitted within a month of discharge. </span></p> \n<p dir=""ltr""><span>In theory, reducing readmissions is a great thing — avoidable hospitalizations are bad for patients and bad for health spending. </span><span>But the story is a little different for safety-net hospitals, which are often located in urban centers and serve poor and vulnerable populations.</span></p> \n<p dir=""ltr"">""We know that 16 to 20 percent of Medicare patients are likely to end up back in the hospital after 30 days,"" said Ashish Jha, a professor of health policy at Harvard who has done extensive research on the topic. ""Why do some people come back and others don't? One of the other things we've known for some time is that poorer patients - people who live in communities with poorer health infrastructures and less social support — those people are more likely to end up back in the hospital.""</p> \n<p dir=""ltr"">Medicare does have some ways of adjusting penalties to take into account the sickness (or health) of a hospitals' patients. But there are still things happening outside the hospital — a lack of primary care providers, for example, or difficulty following discharge instructions — that can send lower-income patients back for a second visit.</p> \n<p dir=""ltr""><span>As a result, safety net hospitals are about </span><a href=""http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=1558273"">twice as likely</a><span> to get slammed with big readmissions fines compared to other providers. </span><span>Medicare is asking safety-net hospitals to work much harder — then penalizes them when don't perform as well as everyone else. </span></p> \n<h3>The solution: Level the playing field across hospitals</h3> \n<p dir=""ltr"">On Thursday, Senators Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), Roger Wicker (R-MS), Mark Kirk (R-IL) and Bill Nelson (D-FL) introduced the Hospital Readmission Accuracy and Accountability Act, which would require Medicare to account for socioeconomic status of patients when calculating penalties.</p> \n<p>Perhaps the most surprising thing here is the fact that a bipartisan crew of politicians came together to act: on Obamacare. <span>""The readmissions policy has been flawed from the beginning,"" said Senator Kirk in a press release. </span></p> \n<p dir=""ltr"">The new legislation itself won't make Obamacare any more expensive. It's been endorsed by the American Medical Association, the American Hospital Association, and a bevy of other provider groups.</p> \n<p dir=""ltr"">Medicare might need to refine the way they handle this over time, but Jha cautions against letting the perfect be the enemy of the good. ""The models we have for socioeconomic status adjustment are better than having no model at all,"" he said. ""We should do this — and continue working on new and better ways of doing it.""</p>"
States don't know how they'll pay for year two of Obamacare,http://www.vox.com/2014/6/22/5827356/states-dont-know-how-theyll-pay-for-year-two-of-obamacare,"More than a dozen states decided to build new health insurance marketplaces under Obamacare. Now, they need to figure out how to pay the costs of running those massive websites.","<p><span>More than a dozen states decided to build new health insurance marketplaces under Obamacare. </span><span>Now, they need to figure out how to pay the costs of running those massive websites.</span></p> \n<p>The Affordable Care Act provided federal grant funding for states to get their new web portals up and running.  The Obama administration doled out <a href=""http://kff.org/health-reform/state-indicator/total-exchange-grants/"">$4.6 billion</a> in grants to states launching their own marketplaces.</p> \n<p><q class=""right"" aria-hidden=""true"">'there won't be any big pot of federal money'</q></p> \n<p>But Obamacare also requires state exchanges to become self-sustaining by the start of 2015. That means every state exchange that will operate next year now needs to figure out how to pay their bills. Every marketplace needs to be able to pay staff (which sometimes number in the hundreds), maintain office space and continue running outreach campaigns to increase the insurance rate.</p> \n<p>""There won't be any big pot of federal money,"" says Elizabeth Carpenter, a director at health research firm Avalere. ""When you think about being able to run an exchange without the federal backstop, it will take awhile to forecast and figure out what money is needed.""</p> \n<p><span>There were 17 state-based exchanges in 2014, and at least 15 of them plan to continue operating in 2015 (Oregon has announced it will transition to Healthcare.gov, while Massachusetts is currently debating that option).</span></p> \n<div style=""text-align:center"">\n<p><img src=""http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/assets/4645173/state_health_insurance_exchange_decisions_medium.png"" class=""photo"" alt=""State_health_insurance_exchange_decisions_medium""></p> \n</div>\n<p>State officials say that, right now, its really hard to know exactly how much money they will need. They only have one year of experience running their insurance marketplace — and aren't sure it represents what a normal, non-launch year would look like.</p> \n<p>""We still don't understand what normal volume is,"" says Richard Onizuka, executive director of the Washington Health Benefits Exchange. ""That comes into play when we're projecting our budget for sustainability.""</p> \n<p>So far, there seem to be about four ways that states have settled on to get their insurance exchange bills paid.</p> \n<h3><span>Charge insurers a fee </span></h3> \n<p>Most state exchanges plan to rely, in least in part, on charging health insurers a fee for selling coverage. So far, the fees set for 2015 range from 1 percent of the monthly premium in the District of Columbia and Vermont to 3.5 percent in Minnesota. Some states also charged fees in 2014, in order to begin generating revenue further in advance, while others are implementing them for the first time.</p> \n<div style=""text-align:center""> \n<p><img alt=""Insurer_fees"" class=""photo"" src=""http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/assets/4645461/insurer_fees.png""></p> \n</div> \n<p>Figuring out the right level for the fee is a difficult task that involves a lot of predictions about what Obamacare will look like in 2015.</p> \n<p>""It's not just anticipating how many people will enroll but also how much premiums are going to be,"" Avalere's Carpenter says. ""The question of long-term sustainability is certainly going to take some time to figure out.""</p> \n<h3>Keep on using grant funding</h3> \n<p><img alt=""Uncle_sam"" class=""photo"" src=""http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/assets/4650767/uncle_sam.png""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">More grants from the federal government? ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ (Detroit Free Press/Getty News Images)</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""right"">the feds have spent $4.6 billion in exchange grants</q></p> \n<p>States can't get new grants from the federal government to run their exchanges after 2015. But that doesn't stop them from using what's leftover from the grants they received in 2014. With more than $4 billion sent out to state, Carpenter says there's still a lot of federal money lying around that states plan to use to make their exchanges run in 2015.</p> \n<p><span>Rhode Island is the most extreme example of this: the state has received $105 million so far to build its insurance exchange. Officials Rhode Island Health Benefits Exchange believe they'll have enough federal grant money to pay for fiscal year 2015 without charging any fees or collecting any state funds.</span></p> \n<h3>Get money from the state</h3> \n<p>Some states are turning to their legislature to help foot the bill for the new insurance exchange. New York State of Health, for example, will rely completely on appropriations from the state to finance its web portal.</p> \n<p><img src=""http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/assets/4650799/2678453389_072413453d_o.jpg"" class=""photo"" alt=""2678453389_072413453d_o""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Large piles of money always helpful when building a health exchange (Nick Ares/Flickr)</p> \n<p>Washington is taking a hybrid approach: the state expects to generate some of its budget by taxing health insurers but is also expecting <a href=""http://bigstory.ap.org/article/budget-model-uncertain-state-health-exchanges"">$40 million</a> in appropriations from the legislature. The state exchange had initially asked for a higher level of appropriations, which it did not receive.</p> \n<p>""Sustainability is going to be a big challenge for all state-based exchanges,"" Onizuka says. ""We will show our first budget in 2015. This year we spent $153 million. It's a big transition [going to a smaller budget].""</p> \n<h3>Get creative</h3> \n<p>There is at least one state thinking quite outside the box when it comes to paying for their exchange. Connecticut is exploring opening a side business — and using the revenue to reduce the fee that it currently plans to charge insurers.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""center"">one way to pay for an exchange: start a side hustle</q></p> \n<p>Connecticut had one of the more successful Obamacare launches, and is now looking to consult with and sell software to states trying to get their own state-based exchanges off the ground. At least one state, Maryland, has already expressed interest in purchasing services from Connecticut.</p> \n<p>""Right now we have an assessment of 1.35 percent on all licensed health insurers in the individual and small group markets,"" AccessHealthCT chief executive Kevin Counihan says. ""Part of the point of having this revenue is to reach a point where that assessment can be reduced.""</p>"

He is commissioning a report about what else Virginia can do to serve low-income residents who would have qualified for Medicaid, but aren't going to get it.</p> \n<p>While signing off on the overall budget, McAuliffe also line-item vetoed two provisions that relate to the Medicaid program. One was a veto of the Medicaid Innovation and Reform Commission, a government body meant to review ""reform proposals.""</p> \n<p>McAuliffe described the proposal in a statement as ""a sham to pretend that the legislature is serious about Medicaid reform and expansion."" The governor also vetoed language that restricts Virginia spending on a Medicaid expansion, which he described as ""unnecessary given its intent to restrict an appropriation that does not exist anywhere in the budget.""</p>"

TSNA levels have increased since 1964.</p> \n<p>Cigarette companies also introduced ventilation holes in cigarette filters so that cigarettes would look healthier on paper. The ventilation holes cause machines to report lower levels of tar and nicotine when testing cigarettes. However, it's been <a href=""http://tobaccocontrol.bmj.com/content/11/suppl_1/i40.full"">documented</a> that these ventilation holes actually change how people smoke cigarettes. Smokers inhale more frequently and more deeply, drawing cancer-causing chemicals farther into the lungs.</p> \n<p>The ill effects of these design changes are compacted by efforts to make cigarettes more attractive and more addictive.</p> \n<p>Tobacco companies have introduced flavorings to make the taste of cigarettes more appealing, while also introducing chemicals that reduce discomfort and irritation in the lungs.

Health spending actually fell while Obamacare insured Americans,http://www.vox.com/2014/6/25/5841716/health-spending-actually-fell-while-obamacare-insured-americans,A new report finds that health care spending went down during the first quarter of 2014.,"<p>The economy shrunk in the first quarter of 2014 and it might be all health care's fault. Believe it or not, that's a good thing.</p> \n<p>According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, the overall GDP shrank by 2.9 percent. This has led some commentators to call it the ""<a href=""http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2014/06/25/economy-first-quarter/11332011/"">worst quarter</a>"" in five years.</p> \n<p><q class=""right"" aria-hidden=""true"">the largest decline in health care services spending since 1982.</q></p> \n<p>But that fall was largely driven by dip in health care spending.

According to the <a href=""https://twitter.com/Altarum_CSHS/status/481876680047607808"">Altarum Institute</a>, this marks the largest decline in health care services spending since the first quarter of 1982.</p> \n<p>""Overall, the health care news is phenomenally good."" said Peter Orszag, former director of the Congressional Budget Office and Office of Management and Budget. ""The supposed acceleration in health spending has been shown to be false.""</p> \n<p>This revision is precisely what we would expect, based on the Census's Quarterly Services Survey released on <a href=""http://www.census.gov/services/"">June 11</a>. This survey — which collects industry <a href=""https://bhs.econ.census.gov/bhs/qss/about.html"">information</a> like hospital revenue, inpatient days and discharges — provided the data that the BEA used to revise its numbers.</p> \n<p><q class=""center"" aria-hidden=""true"">""Overall, the news is phenomenally good."" </q></p> \n<p>As Orszag <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/6/15/5807046/orszag-its-time-for-some-optimism-about-health-care-spending"">explained</a>, BEA's initial estimates were mostly a guess — an educated guess, but a guess nonetheless. ""It was this puzzle: we had big increase in the early GDP numbers, but no evidence from other sources to match. That generated media hoopla, even though the number was basically made up.""</p> \n<p>Now that the data are in, they show that health spending actually <i>declined </i>in the first three months of 2014 relative to the end of 2013. That means the slowdown in health spending is continuing, though <span>it's hard to pin down</span><span> exactly</span><span> what's driving it. Economists agree that the recession was causing part of the slowdown, but that effect should be winding down. Hospitals and other providers appear to be cutting waste and making the health care system more efficient. Obamacare is probably playing some role, but it's challenging to say how big that role is.</span></p> \n<p>Charles Roehrig, director of the Altarum Institute's Center for Sustainable Health Spending, cautions against reading too much into the numbers. Data can be noisy from one quarter to the next; it's important to put today's news in a fuller context.<span> Given the March surge in Obamacare enrollment, it's possible that we could see a bump in spending during the second quarter. Additionally, BEA's numbers reported out today only account for health care services; other elements of health spending may have behaved differently. </span></p> \n<p>But it's hard not to be <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/6/15/5807046/orszag-its-time-for-some-optimism-about-health-care-spending"">optimistic</a>.</p> \n<p>""It certainly has been good news up through the end of 2013,"" Roehrig said.

The Obama administration chose the worst months of the year to sell health insurance,http://www.vox.com/2014/6/25/5843058/the-obama-administration-chose-the-worst-months-of-the-year-to-sell,A new study suggests that the holidays are a terrible time for insurance enrollment.,"<p>The holiday season may be the very worst time to encourage people to enroll in health insurance — and that's exactly what Obamacare does.</p> \n<p>The health law sets up ""open enrollment periods"" for the insurance exchanges, a few months each year when people can enroll in coverage. Insurers can't keep enrollment open year-round, because people would wait until they got sick or injured to enroll, which would drive up the cost of insurance.</p> \n<p>Obamacare's first open enrollment period lasted from October 1, 2013 through the end of March 2014; this gave people plenty of time to learn about new insurance options and enroll in coverage, despite the technical issues that plagued Healthcare.gov's rollout.</p> \n<p>Open enrollment for 2015 will last from November through February. <span>The Obama administration probably picked late fall for open enrollment because that is when Medicare and most employers permit insurance enrollment changes. </span><span>But between Thanksgiving and Christmas, late fall is also incredibly stressful, both financially and emotionally.</span><span> </span></p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""right"">late fall is stressful, both financially and emotionally. </q></p> \n<p>According to a <a href=""http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/early/2014/06/20/hlthaff.2014.0007"">new study</a> in Health Affairs, people's capacity for decision-making is stretched especially thin during the lead up to the holiday season. And when people are stressed, behavioral economists have found that decision-making is done with a sort of tunnel vision: people focus only on their most pressing short-term problems, sidelining long-term issues.</p> \n<p>""The holiday season between Thanksgiving and New Year's — with pressures for buying presents, travel, and the onset of winter home-heating bills — strains many family budgets,"" the authors write. ""Research on people's reactions to scarcity of time and money suggests that the holiday season may be the worst time of the year to require complex health insurance enrollment decisions.""</p> \n<p>The authors suggest that fewer people will buy health insurance if open enrollment is restricted to the holiday season — and the people who <i>do </i>enroll might be sicker, on average. <span>""The implications are especially worrisome with respect to younger low-income people who have not had health insurance and might lack experience choosing among plans. If they cannot make a choice among the health plan options and remain un- insured, the goals of the ACA may be in jeopardy.""</span></p> \n<h3>Should open enrollment be in the spring instead?</h3> \n<p>The study authors have a different idea: move open enrollment to  tax filing season. Tax returns (and the Earned Income Tax Credit) leave people feeling more financially secure; <a href=""http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=251092"">prior research</a> has shown that this leads to more spending on durable goods and services like furniture, appliances, and cars.</p> \n<p>During this time, people are more willing and able to cope with complex financial decisions — like choosing an insurance plan. Additionally, the tax filing season is when people will have the best sense of their income for the upcoming year, which is important for calculating subsidies.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""center"">the authors recommend having open enrollment start in february, end in april. </q></p> \n<p>There's also generally more interest in health insurance around this time. The authors collected a decade's worth of Google search data, and found that interest in insurance drops off precipitously during the holiday season (shaded in green, below), likely due to those financial and emotional stressors. By contrast, interest is middling but stable during the tax season (shaded in red).</p> \n<p> </p> \n<p class=""caption""><img src=""http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/assets/4671879/swartzgraves.png"" class=""photo"" alt=""Swartzgraves"">Source: Health Affairs</p> \n<p>The Obama administration has broad authority to define the open enrollment period.

A judge with the State Court of Appeals wrote that the restriction ""exceeded the scope of [the state's] regulatory authority.""</p> \n<p>The ban on sugary drinks larger than 16-ounces was meant to stem the massive, and rising, consumption of sugar in American diets.

Fast food chains challenged the requirement as a First Amendment violation, but ultimately lost their battle in court.</p> \n<p>Other policies have fallen victim to politics: In 2008, Bloomberg proposed a congestion pricing scheme that would charge an $8 fee to cars entering and leaving Manhattan during business hours.

New York often served as the experiment for the rest of the country to watch, like it did with calorie labels, and not having that initial test is likely a big setback for other cities or states interested in exploring this kind of policy.</p> \n<p>At the same time, the New York ruling was a bit idiosyncratic: it applied specifically to the powers that the New York City's Board of Health did (or in this case, did not) have to take this kind of action. Legally speaking, at least, it doesn't do anything to impede other cities that want to take on a similar effort elsewhere.</p> \n<p>So far though, the only legislative reaction to the Bloomberg ban wasn't another, similar law elsewhere.

You might be addicted to sugar. Here's how.,http://www.vox.com/2014/6/30/5855404/you-might-be-addicted-to-sugar-heres-how,There's a reason it's so addicting.,"<p>If you crave sugar, you're not alone. That craving is a natural response to how the sweetener interacts with the brain.</p> \n<p>This video, from neuroscientist and addiction expert Nicole Avena at TED, walks through what happens in the brain when someone is chowing down on a chocolate cake or some other sugary treat:</p> \n<center> \n<p><iframe src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/lEXBxijQREo"" frameborder=""0"" height=""315"" width=""560""></iframe> <br id=""1404141644406""></p> \n</center> \n<p>As Avena explains, sugar can overload the brain reward's system and lead to strong cravings and loss of control. Sugar can, in other words, become an addiction.</p> \n<p>Unlike other foods, sugar's effects on the brain also don't appear to level  off after a certain amount of consumption. That means sugar doesn't become boring, in the same way  broccoli can if you eat a lot of it.</p> \n<p>Through its consistently rewarding effect, sugar does, Avena explains, ""behave a little bit like a drug."" She emphasizes that the effect isn't as strong as, say, nicotine or heroin, but it is similar.</p> \n<p>Sugar's effects on the brain are why some policymakers and advocates want stricter regulations on the substance. Robert Lustig, a medical expert at the University of California, San Francisco, even <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/6/2/5771008/the-case-for-treating-sugar-like-a-drug"">argues</a> that sugar should be treated like a drug when it comes to regulations and taxes.</p> \n<h3>Further reading</h3> \n<ul> \n<li><a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/6/2/5771008/the-case-for-treating-sugar-like-a-drug"">The case for treating sugar like a drug</a></li> \n<li><a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/6/24/5838360/the-worlds-insane-sugar-consumption-in-one-video/in/5551015"">The world's insane sugar consumption, in one video</a></li> \n<li><a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/6/26/5845478/the-bloomberg-large-soda-ban-is-officially-dead/in/5551015"">The Bloomberg large soda ban is officially dead</a></li> \n</ul>"

By picking a retired corporate executive instead of continuing the tradition of tapping a former military general, the White House is signaling that it wants someone who can seriously change the management structure across the VA's health-care system.</p> \n<p>McDonald does, however, have some ties to the military. He graduated near the top of his class from the U.S. Military Academy at West Point and served in the military for five years.</p> \n<p>Later on, McDonald took an entry-level job at Procter &amp; Gamble. He eventually worked up the company, which is known for products like Tide detergent and Charmin toilet paper.</p> \n<p>McDonald abruptly retired from Procter &amp; Gamble, <a href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/pg-ceo-bob-mcdonald-retires-2013-5"">Business Insider reported</a>, after analysts and investors complained about reductions in profit forecasts.

"4 medical tests that are awkward, embarrassing, andÂ unnecessary",http://www.vox.com/2014/7/7/5862446/four-medical-tests-that-are-awkward-embarrassing-and-unnecessary,It's time to put down the speculum.,"<p>Medical exams can be important, life-saving events. There are numerous screenings that the federal government recommends<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/adultrec.htm""> happen on a regular basis</a>, ranging from tests for sexually transmitted diseases to ones detecting certain cancers.</p> \n<p>This is not, however, true of every medical test that modern medicine has at its disposal. There are some exams that healthy people simply should not get, tests that research doesn't show to make us any healthier and tests that often involve a decent amount of discomfort. These are four of those tests that doctors and federal recommendations say otherwise healthy patients should not get — and that you probably don't want to get anyway.</p> \n<h3>1) Regular pelvic exams</h3> \n<center> \n<p><img src=""http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/assets/4719194/183971895.jpg"" class=""photo"" alt=""183971895""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Put down the speculum and nobody gets hurt (BSIP)</p> \n</center> \n<p>Changing into a paper-thin hospital gown, hoisting feet up into stirrups and being probed vaginally with a speculum is, to say the least, an unpleasant experience. And it's something that lots women go through every year with a pelvic exam during an annual well-woman visit to the gynecologist.</p> \n<p>The American College of Physicians, which represents the country's internists, issued <a href=""http://annals.org/article.aspx?articleid=1884537"">new guidelines</a> on July 1 that specifically recommend against annual pelvic exams for healthy women who are not pregnant.</p> \n<p>Their rationale: research shows that the annual pelvic exam isn't very good at detecting ovarian cancer, which is supposed to be the whole point of the test. Between three studies that screened 5,633 women with pelvic exams, they found exactly four cases of ovarian cancer.</p> \n<p>Even when cancer is detected, it's not clear the pelvic exam produces better health outcomes: separate research showed no reductions in deaths from ovarian cancer (or any cancer, for that matter) in women who received the annual pelvic screenings.</p> \n<p>That's little benefit with some downside. ""Screening pelvic examination leads to harms including fear, anxiety, embarrassment, pain and discomfort,"" the ACP's recommendations say. ""In addition, false-positive screening results can lead to unnecessary"" medical care. Their recommendation: pelvic exams should only be used for women who are experiencing certain symptoms or are pregnant.</p> \n<h3>2) Annual pap smears</h3> \n<p><img src=""http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/assets/4719210/98503802.jpg"" class=""photo"" alt=""98503802""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Annual pap smears are unnecessary. Public pap smears, which Kathy Griffin appears to have pioneered in 2010, are certainly unnecessary. (Angela Weiss / Getty Images)</p> \n<p>This is another procedure that the government says should be kicked out of the typical gynecologist visit. Healthy women don't need an annual Pap smear, which is the test for cervical cancer. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force instead recommends that women between 21 and 64 receive the screening once every three years, which their research shows to offer the same health care benefit as annual screenings.</p> \n<p>The story here is similar to pelvic exams: research does suggest that regular Pap smears do help lower the rate of death from cervical cancer, although they only need to happen every three years to get that benefit. Too many tests come with their own downsides.</p> \n<p>""Screening....more often than every 3 years confers little additional benefit, with large increases in harms, including additional procedures and assessment and treatment of transient lesions,"" the UPSTF <a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf11/cervcancer/cervcancerrs.htm#clinical"">writes </a>in its treatment guidelines.</p> \n<h3>3) A cardiac stress test</h3> \n<center> \n<p><img src=""http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/assets/4719234/179800690.jpg"" class=""photo"" alt=""179800690""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Just another regular day of unnecessary shirtless biking while attached to electrodes (BSIP)</p> \n</center> \n<p>The cardiac stress test is awkward in its own special way: this is the one where doctors hook you up to some wires, and have you do some treadmill — running or stationary biking — to look at blood flow during and after exercise. This happens with surprising frequency to people who don't have any heart disease symptoms. About 45 percent of cardiac stress tests are administered as a ""screening"" procedure. That shouldn't be happening.</p> \n<p>The American Academy of Cardiologists — the doctors who know heart health the best — specifically recommend against cardiac stress tests for healthy patients because they don't actually improve health outcomes. ""This practice may, in fact, lead to unnecessary invasive procedures and excess radiation exposure without any proven impact on patients' outcomes,"" <a href=""http://This%20practice%20may,%20in%20fact,%20lead%20to%20unnecessary%20invasive%20procedures%20and%20excess%20radiation%20exposure%20without%20any%20proven%20impact%20on%20patients%E2%80%99%20outcomes.%20"">the group writes in recent guidelines.</a></p> \n<h3>4) Colonoscopies before age 50 — or more than every five years</h3> \n<center> \n<p><img src=""http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/assets/4719266/165445186.jpg"" class=""photo"" alt=""165445186""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">That colonoscope goes exactly where you think it does (Tannis Toohey / Toronto Star)</p> \n</center> \n<p>A colonoscopy lets a doctor look at the inside of patient's colon, mostly to check for cancer or pre-cancerous growth (known as polyps). Prior to a colonoscopy, patients are generally required to empty out the contents of their colon. That <a href=""http://www.health.harvard.edu/fhg/updates/preparing-for-a-colonoscopy.shtml"">often means </a>no solid food on the day prior to the exam — or drinking a full gallon of an electrolyte solution. And that all happens before a tube between four and six feet is inserted into the rectum.</p> \n<p>If this all sounds unpleasant, rest assured: this test is not recommended for any healthy people under 50. And even for those over 50, the test is not supposed to happen more than every five to ten years. That's largely because colon cancer is a disease that develops very slowly. If the test doesn't find cancer the first time and you don't have any symptoms or risk factors, ""your chance of developing it is very low for the next ten years,"" <a href=""http://www.choosingwisely.org/doctor-patient-lists/colonoscopy/"">guidelines from the American Gastroenterologists Association say</a>.</p> \n<p>And, as with any medical procedure, the colonoscopy has risks. While typically a safe procedure, it can occasionally cause bleeding or tears in the colon. It's also an expensive test, typically costing upwards of $1,000.</p>"

But persistent data problems on the back end could pose problems for insurers, enrollees, and the government agencies trying to implement Obamacare.</p> \n<p>Between October and December 2013, states using Healthcare.gov experienced over 2.9 million inconsistencies between applications and information in the federal ""data hub"" that applications are supposed to be verified against,<a href=""http://oig.hhs.gov/oei/reports/oei-01-14-00180.asp""> a new federal report found</a>. State insurance exchanges are also still grappling with substantial technical challenges.</p> \n<p>It's not clear how many enrollees are affected, because each applicant can have multiple inconsistencies. These inconsistencies also aren't evidence of fraud — one marketplace reported glitches where applications identified infants and young children as being incarcerated when, obviously, they are not.</p> \n<p>The vast majority of inconsistencies were associated with citizenship status, income, and whether the applicant had access to affordable insurance through their employer (which would make him ineligible for subsidies).</p> \n<p class=""caption""><img alt=""Screen_shot_2014-07-02_at_12.35.01_pm"" class=""photo"" src=""http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/assets/4701606/Screen_Shot_2014-07-02_at_12.35.01_PM.png"">Source: Office of Inspector General, Department of Health and Human Services</p> \n<p>Legally-residing immigrants can receive subsidies to purchase insurance on the state exchanges, but undocumented residents cannot.

Obamacare doesn't cover contraception for men,http://www.vox.com/2014/7/3/5868477/obamacare-should-cover-vasectomies-too,"There's a safe, effective, and cheap form of birth control that health reform overlooked.","<p><span>Obamacare </span><a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/7/3/5865697/hobby-lobby-doesnt-destroy-obamacares-reproductive-health-gains"">made great strides</a><span> in improving women's access to reproductive services, but it doesn't do much to facilitate the same for men. In part, that's a logistical problem, given that men simply have </span><a href=""http://www.plannedparenthood.org/health-info/men/birth-control-men"">fewer options</a><span> when it comes to to birth control. </span></p> \n<p><span>But there's one procedure the health law overlooks completely: vasectomies.</span></p> \n<p>Under Obamacare, insurance plans have to cover women's tubal ligation without a co-pay. This is <a href=""https://www.healthcare.gov/what-are-my-birth-control-benefits/"">in addition</a> to the standard birth control pills, IUDs, and emergency contraceptives that have been the primary focus of discourse provoked by the Hobby Lobby decision. <a href=""http://www.webmd.com/sex/birth-control/tubal-ligation-and-tubal-implants"">Tubal ligation</a> — better known as ""having your tubes tied"" — is a permanent form of sterilization where a woman's fallopian tubes are blocked, tied, or cut, interrupting eggs traveling from the ovaries to the uterus.</p> \n<p>Vasectomies are basically the less expensive and less invasive male equivalent.</p> \n<p>Vasectomies, which <a href=""http://www.plannedparenthood.org/health-info/birth-control/vasectomy"">block or close</a> the tubes that carry sperm, are actually safer than tubal ligation. The difference in risk isn't huge, but it's real. Women need to be put under general anesthesia to have their tubes tied, which always carries a chance of serious complications. Vasectomies, by contrast, only require local numbing.</p> \n<p>They're also <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/ref/health/healthguide/esn-vasectomy-ess.html"">substantially less expensive</a> than a woman having her tubes tied. The price of a vasectomy ranges between <a href=""http://www.plannedparenthood.org/health-info/birth-control/vasectomy"">$350 to $1,000</a>; female sterilization can cost up to <a href=""http://www.plannedparenthood.org/health-info/birth-control/vasectomy"">six times</a> as much.<b> </b>According to economists, vasectomies are actually one of the <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19041435"">cheapest</a> contraceptive methods, second only to nonhormonal IUDs.</p> \n<p>Vasectomies are considered permanent because not all reversals are successful, so it's not for all men. But for some — those who don't want children, or who are confident that they're done having kids — a vasectomy serves as a guarantee against unplanned pregnancies. As a bonus, vasectomies could spare partners the daily hassle of taking birth control pills, which have hormones that can cause unpleasant side effects.</p> \n<p>Insurers may already cover vasectomies, but high co-pays or deductibles could present a cost barrier. In a world where tubal ligation is covered without a co-pay and vasectomies aren't, a couple might opt for the riskier, more expensive procedure.</p> \n<p>Giving women more control over their reproductive health is certainly important, especially since reversible forms of contraception (like the pill) are <i>only</i> available to women. Taking the opportunity to also give men more control over their reproductive capacity wouldn't diminish that — and it's not clear why Obamacare doesn't take that opportunity.</p>"
"The Supreme Court sided against birth control again, and Sotomayor is not happy about it",http://www.vox.com/2014/7/7/5873611/the-supreme-courts-other-contraceptives-ruling-explained,A new ruling has the Supreme Court's female justices even madder than they were about Hobby Lobby.,"<p>The H<span>obby Lobby decision wasn't the Supreme Court's last word on birth control.</span></p> \n<p>Late Thursday, six justices signed onto an injunction that allows Wheaton College, a religious university, more flexibility to not comply with <a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/obamacare-and-contraceptives/what-is-birth-control"">Obamacare's contraceptive mandate</a>. It led to a scathing dissent from the court's three female members.</p> \n<p>""Those who are bound by our decisions usually believe they can take us at our word,"" Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote, in a dissent joined by Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Elena Kagan. ""Not today.""</p> \n<p><span>Sotomayor went on to argue that the injunction would risk stripping ""hundreds of Wheaton's employees and students of their legal entitlement to contraceptive coverage.""</span></p> \n<p>The Wheaton College case centers on a Christian liberal arts college in Illinois. It is part of another wave of lawsuits against Obamacare's contraceptives mandate that the recent Hobby Lobby decision did not resolve.</p> \n<p><span>These lawsuits challenge the flexibilities that the Obama administration has already offered religious non-profits, arguing that the existing accommodations don't do enough to protect religious liberty. </span></p> \n<h3><span>What is the Wheaton College case about?</span></h3> \n<p><span>Back in February 2012, some religiously-affiliated non-profits (particularly universities and hospitals) successfully pushed the Obama administration to offer an ""</span><a style=""line-height: 1.5; background-color: #ffffff;"" href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/02/01/the-white-houses-contraceptives-compromise/"">accommodation</a><span>"" that would allow them to opt-out of the contraceptives mandate. </span></p> \n<p>The idea behind the compromise: non-profits wouldn't pay for contraceptives themselves but instead have their health insurance plan foot the bill for birth control.</p> \n<p>In order to apply for this compromise, non-profits are supposed to use a very specific form to certify their opposition to providing their employees with contraception. The form, for the especially curious, is Employee Benefits Security Administration form 700 (EBSA 700).</p> \n<p><span> After that form is filed, insurers are supposed to pay for the contraception themselves without passing the cost on to the religious organizations. Insurers recoup their losses through reduced fees paid to the government.</span></p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""center"">some organizations claim the form makes them complicit in the use of birth control, even though they're not paying for it.</q></p> \n<p>Wheaton College, and dozens of other non-profits, object to having to file this form on grounds of religious freedom. <span>Wheaton objects to the same birth control methods that were at issue in</span><span> </span><span>Hobby Lobby</span><span>, IUDs and emergency contraception (like Plan B). Other nonprofits object to the full spectrum of contraceptives. </span></p> \n<p>The organizations claim that the accommodation violates their religious beliefs, because submitting the EBSA 700 to insurers/third-party administrators (TPAs) makes them complicit in the use of the birth control, even though they're not paying for it. There are <a href=""http://www.becketfund.org/hhsinformationcentral/"">51 active court cases</a> challenging the accommodation on these grounds.</p> \n<h3>What did the Supreme Court decide about Wheaton College?</h3> \n<p><span>The Court issued an injunction, ruling that Wheaton College does not need to file the EBSA 700 against its objections while their court case is being resolved. </span></p> \n<p><b></b>The injunction itself does not necessarily foreshadow that Wheaton College will be successful in their lawsuit;<b> </b>the six justices who signed on in favor are clear in their opinion that this is not a decision in favor of Wheaton's arguments.</p> \n<p><span>But it does halt Wheaton College's obligation to submit the accommodation form until the courts resolve whether the accommodation does, in fact, infringe upon religious freedom. Similar injunctions have been granted to other religious nonprofits by lower courts.</span></p> \n<p>The Supreme Court indicated that Wheaton's employees should still have access to contraceptives without co-pays in the interim. According to the opinion, Wheaton can submit a letter to the federal government documenting its objection to completing the EBSA 700, and the <i>government</i> can then coordinate with the institution's third-party administrator to assure coverage.</p> \n<p><q class=""center"" aria-hidden=""true"">sotomayor is troubled by the authority the court used to justify the injunction. </q></p> \n<h3>Why was Sotomayor's dissent so scathing?</h3> \n<p>Justice Sotomayor raises at least four objections to the injunction in her dissent.</p> \n<ol> \n<li>Sotomayor contends that the Wheaton injunction contradicts the decision issued in the Hobby Lobby case. The opinions written by Justices Alito and Kennedy — who both ruled in favor of Hobby Lobby — used the existence of the accommodation to justify their conclusion. In her dissent, Sotomayor worries that this apparent flip-flop will undermine public confidence in the Supreme Court.<br><br>There is <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2014/07/06/more-on-what-the-wheaton-college-injunction-does-and-does-not-mean-for-contraception-coverage/"">disagreement</a> about whether the Wheaton injunction actually counters the Hobby Lobby ruling. The Hobby Lobby decision notes that the present accommodation imposes less on religious organizations than the actual contraceptive mandate, but it's possible that the government could arrange something that imposes even less still. </li> \n<li><span>The dissent argues that the injunction unravels months of government work required to craft the accommodation through usual regulatory processes, which will generate unnecessary costs and layers of bureaucracy.<br><br>The Supreme Court, Sotomayor writes, has ""no reason to think that the administrative scheme [Wheaton] foists on the government today is workable or effective on a national scale.""</span></li> \n<li><span>Sotomayor is troubled by the authority the Court used to justify the injunction. In her dissent, she writes that these types of injunctions are only appropriate when ""it is necessary...in aid of our jurisdiction and the legal rights at the issue are indisputably clear.""<br><span><br>Sotomayor argues that the Wheaton injunction easily fails both of those requirements. The case is being decided by the District Court, not the Supreme Court, so this is not ""in aid of their jurisdiction."" Furthermore, lower courts have come to different conclusions about the legality of the accommodation, so the legal rights in question cannot be called ""indisputably clear.""</span></span></li> \n<li><span>Last, Sotomayor also makes the case that this decision could be a risk for those who use Wheaton's health plan, as their insurer only has a legal obligation to provide contraception when they receive the particular form that the injunction allows them not to file. </span></li> \n</ol> \n<h3>Why didn't the Hobby Lobby decision settle this issue?</h3> \n<p><span>In Hobby Lobby, the Supreme Court </span><a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/obamacare-and-contraceptives/what-is-obamacare"" style=""line-height: 1.5;"">ruled</a><span> that certain for-profit companies may refuse to cover forms of birth control that it finds morally objectionable. </span></p> \n<p><span>That decision didn't have any immediate legal implications for nonprofits, who had the accommodation that the Obama administration offered in February 2012. The non-profits are challenging the accommodation itself as unworkable. </span></p> \n<h3>What problems could this introduce?</h3> \n<p><span>Here's the trouble with the recommendation in the injunction: the government may not have all of the information about the insurer or third-party administrator that it needs to coordinate birth control coverage. </span></p> \n<p><span>T</span><span>his information may not be readily available without that form — and it's not clear whether the government could compel disclosure from the objecting organization.</span></p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""center"">the government may not have all the information it needs to coordinate birth control coverage.</q></p> \n<p>This isn't a problem for Wheaton College itself, because the government can glean the necessary information from the lawsuit itself. Wheaton has already submitted a letter to the government certifying its objection. But if this new opt-out to the accommodation gets scaled up, it could create problems.</p> \n<p>""Presumably once the government receives a certification from a nonprofit objecting to contraceptive coverage, it will need to contact the organization to ask who the organization uses for its insurer or TPA is, and then separately contact the insurer or TPA,"" <a href=""http://healthaffairs.org/blog/2014/07/04/implementing-health-reform-a-follow-up-supreme-court-contraceptives-decision-at-odds-with-hobby-lobby/"">writes Timothy Jost</a>, a law professor at Washington and Lee University. ""Whether the nonprofit is legally required to respond to the government inquiry is not clear.""</p> \n<p>And as long as the legal workability of the accommodation is uncertain, it's hard to see it as a firm solution for extending contraceptive coverage to employees at for-profit corporations like Hobby Lobby; extending the accommodation could trigger more lawsuits, resulting in more injunctions.</p> \n<p>Moreover, the accommodation was the result of months of cooperative governmental effort, a process that considered more public comments than <a href=""http://www.californiahealthline.org/road-to-reform/2013/birth-control-mandate-the-most-controversial-regulation-ever"">any regulation on record</a>.</p> \n<h3>What's next?</h3> \n<p>The Supreme Court's injunction is specific to the Wheaton case, which is currently pending appeal. However, the injunction does establish a precedent that lower courts may observe when other religious nonprofits lodge similar objections to the contraceptive mandate accommodation.</p> \n<p>Wheaton College v. Burwell is currently pending in front of a federal court of appeals. While the court cannot — and would not — presume to define the college's beliefs, it does have the authority to determine whether those beliefs are ""substantially"" burdened by the accommodation.</p> \n<p><span>If Wheaton does win its case, the federal government may need to devise a </span><i style=""line-height: 1.5;"">new</i><span> accommodation requiring less action from the religious organization, while accounting for the problems outlined above. </span></p>"
The giant problem American health care ignores,http://www.vox.com/2014/7/7/5877227/the-giant-problem-american-health-care-ignores,The United States spends more and gets less in health care. Here's why.,"<p>Lots has been written about how high health care costs in the US are, and how mediocre outcomes are relative to those high costs. <a style=""line-height: 1.5; background-color: #ffffff;"" href=""http://www.amazon.com/The-American-Health-Care-Paradox/dp/1610392094"">The American Health Care Paradox: Why Spending More Is Getting Us Less</a> offers a new way of looking at the issue.</p> \n<p>Health reform efforts have emphasized health insurance and medicine, sidelining social service programs like nutritional support and housing assistance — programs that can be influential for keeping people healthy and <i>producing </i>health, instead of just reacting when people fall ill, like the health care system often does.</p> \n<p>Ignoring the social side of health is a problem, and it's a problem that's been plaguing the United States for decades.</p> \n<p><span></span><span>Elizabeth Bradley, a professor at Yale University, and Lauren Taylor, a Presidential Scholar at Harvard Divinity School, examined this at length in their book. </span><span>I spoke with the authors about the issues they see in the current system, what lessons we might draw from other nations, and what policymakers should think about next. </span></p> \n<p><span>What follows is a transcript of our conversation, edited for clarity and length.</span></p> \n<p><b>Adrianna McIntyre: Can you start by summarizing the core message in your book — what is the ""paradox"" in American health care, and how do you start to unravel it? </b></p> \n<p>Lauren Taylor: The paradox that we outline is one that a lot of readers will be familiar with: that the United States has very high health-care costs, and in many cases middling — and sometimes lousy — health outcomes when you look at certain metrics. These are metrics — like infant mortality and life expectancy — where, when you look across developed nations, we're really at or near the bottom.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""right"">""maybe 'health spending' isn't telling us the whole story.""</q></p> \n<p>People cited this paradox before our book, and tried to explain it in any number of different ways. That included rationales like, ""Well, U.S. health outcomes are bad because too few people have insurance"" or ""because prices are just high.""</p> \n<p>What our book tries to do is offer another reason that hasn't been talked about much in health policy: maybe ""health spending"" isn't telling us the whole story. Maybe we need to look at a broader summary of what resources nation puts in to support population health.</p> \n<p>To do this, we included social services spending in our study, which captures things like housing, food assistance, and job training. The ratio of health to social-service spending was more predictive of several outcomes than health spending alone. This led us to suggest that social-service spending — and, more broadly, attention to the social determinants of health — could be a missing piece in the health reform discourse.</p> \n<p><img src=""http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/assets/4544659/healthcareparadox.png"" class=""photo"" alt=""Healthcareparadox""></p> \n<p><b>AM: This all started with a New York Times editorial that you two co-authored, and the preface of your book talks about the title of that editorial. Can you explain why </b><a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/09/opinion/to-fix-health-care-help-the-poor.html?_r=0"">To Fix Health Care, Help the Poor</a><b> is overly simplistic? </b></p> \n<p>Elizabeth Bradley: As the writer, you don't select the title; the editor does. While we were delighted that the New York Times wanted to cover this, the title made us step back a bit.</p> \n<p>That title laid this whole problem at the feet of ""the poor."" In some ways, I think that narrowly portrayed our work as implying that this is all about people who are low-income. It suggested that if we could get those people — people who are homeless, drug users, the unemployed — if we could fix that piece, we would be done.</p> \n<p>Although that is clearly important, our point is broader than that. The root of the problem we're talking about applies to the middle-class, the upper-middle class, to everybody.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""center"">""the issue plays itself out in all levels of our society.""</q></p> \n<p>Think about shoulder pain or back pain. It's very common in the American public to think ""What kind of MRI do I need? What kind of specialist should I go to?"" as opposed to thinking ""Hm, maybe the briefcase I've been carrying around is too heavy. Maybe I'm not sleeping well. Maybe I haven't hit the gym for the last three weeks.""</p> \n<p>The issue of not appreciating the non-medical side of health plays itself out in <i>all</i> levels of our society. It's just that when you're middle-class or upper-middle class, you can afford to pay out-of-pocket to resolve these problems. When you're in a lower income bracket, that sometimes falls to the state.</p> \n<p>To address the problem of over-medicalization of health we need to actually get to the way people relate to their own health, no matter how wealthy they are.</p> \n<p><b>AM: You interviewed dozens of professionals who work in both health care and social services sectors for this book, and you say that the message you heard from them was quite consistent: the disconnect between health care and social services frustrated them. Was this surprising? </b></p> \n<p>LT:<span> We asked these providers about their experiences at the front lines: what kind of interactions they had with each other, how their work crossed the boundary between the two sectors, and what challenges exist in working across that boundary. How does the current system support them in that cross-boundary work, or how does it impede them in that sort of thinking?</span></p> \n<p>Having done qualitative work before, we're used to really having to dig to pull out these emergent themes that fit the data set. But here, it was just so clear. People said on both sides ,""Yes, we're treating the same populations, and it's incredibly frustrating to feel like I don't have contact with people who work in the other sector.""</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""right"">""my caution is that we've been here before.""</q></p> \n<p>EB: It was clear as a bell that we were capturing something that was already ingrained in the experience of front-line providers. There's sort of a moment in time with the ACA, among other things, that may put us on a platform to really shift in how we think about health care and our investment in health.</p> \n<p>My caution is that we've been here before. There have been times — in the late '60s, the early '70s, the '90s — where the country put together plans and legislation to try to make providers think about the social determinants of health. And each time, through complicated cultural, economic, and social pressures, we have veered back into our comfort zone of medicalization.</p> \n<p>I'm eager to watch what's happening right now, but if history is predictive, it's possible we'll go right back down that road.</p> \n<p><b>AM: What are some of the most important lessons we can take away from other nations on how to bridge this gap between health care and social services?</b></p> \n<p>EB: I would pick out three lessons. The first is that a lot of our current situation is related to root cultural values underlying the history that has brought us to this place.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""right"">""culture and values are Pieces of this puzzle.""</q></p> \n<p>Looking elsewhere, we thought the ideas in Scandinavia were very interesting. But can we really staple those into the United States? Maybe not, because it's not just the strategy they're using today; that strategy is sitting on a historical bedrock of greater collectivism. Culture and underlying values are pieces of this puzzle.</p> \n<p>The second lesson is perhaps less depressing. There are interesting tactics that have been used in other countries that I think we can do something with. For example, one that I think is most important is joint budgeting and joint planning for both health services and housing, education, employment support, and other social services. This is something we saw again and again in Scandinavia, and it makes sense. It forces people to say, ""Here's all of the money we have to spend, here are all of the services we could get. How can we maximize the impact on health?""</p> \n<p>We don't do that in the United States. We <i>could</i>, but we don't.</p> \n<p>The last lesson is maybe the most hopeful. While Scandinavian nations are often seen by the United States as very socialized, the truth is that they run on localism. All of this joint budgeting and planning happens at a local, county level. That gives great hope to the United States that there can be great experimentation at the local level.</p> \n<p>There's a huge amount of potential for the private sector to be quite innovative with this, and I'm really excited to see what they do. I do have some pause because the money and the previous responsibility has always been with the health care sector; it seems natural for them to take a leadership role. What's the balancing force that will ensure that that leadership doesn't tip us back into the medicalization problem? That will be our challenge.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""center"">""in scandinavia, it's very clear who should lead. here, we're not really sure.""</q></p> \n<p>LT: In Scandinavia, there's a sense of accountability for population health at the local level. I think that's part of the concern here. In Scandinavia, the local government really takes the lead and they're the arbiter of different interests. They make sure the process is moving forward, and that the planning and the budgeting is responsive to public needs.</p> \n<p>Who's going to play that role in the United States? Someone needs to hold the reins. In Scandinavia, it's very clear who should lead. Here, we're not really sure who plays that role.</p> \n<p><b>AM: I know you don't presume to have all of the answers for solving our health care system's problems, but what should we look to do in the short term? What are some immediate next steps that we can point policymakers toward? </b></p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""right"">""the fear I have is that 'culture of health' will become a piece of jargon.""<br></q></p> \n<p>LT: The excitement around the ""culture of health"" concept and shared accountability is fantastic. We're so pleased to see it, and to see so many big names and big funders coming on board. The fear that I have in that is that ""culture of health"" will become a piece of jargon and the health economists will roll their eyes and dismiss it as ""fluffy"" or pie-in-the-sky.</p> \n<p>I think the research agenda should move quickly to identify a few things: who will lead, how will accountability be measured, and what are the metrics of shared accountability or integration across structural boundaries that we want to be testing in a rigorous empirical way.</p> \n<p>EB: We also really need to change the dialogue for ""everyman"" on the street. We need to promote an actual understanding of what <i>creates</i> health and how dangerous it can be — and how expensive it can be — to not pursue the most effective things to promote health. To have that more in the fabric of everyday life in America, that's what's needed.</p> \n<p><b>AM: Something you explore in your book that I haven't seen much elsewhere is trying to understand why our welfare system looks so much different than that of other nations. I thought you put forward a really interesting theory about how the USdoesn't have a history of feudalism that many other nations share.</b></p> \n<p>LT: This hypothesis came from some of the interviews we did in Scandinavia, where we asked people why they thought their nations had such confidence and trust in government. We would joke with them about Reagan and how he said the nine most frightening words in the English language are ""I'm from the government and I'm here to help."" They would just kind of giggle and say ""We have none of that attitude here.""</p> \n<p>When we pressed some people on why they think that is, this emerged. For them, the state has just been around for so long and has always been seen as a provider.</p> \n<p>The government grew out of a feudalist system where the feudal lords really had an interest in caring for people we might call ""serfs."" The underprivileged were seen as an integrated part of the economy. There was an interest on the part of those who <i>had </i>means to care for those who didn't.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""center"">""THERE WAS AN INTEREST ON THE PART OF THOSE WHO HAD MEANS TO CARE FOR THOSE WHO DIDN'T.""</q></p> \n<p>There's  another interesting hypothesis that is somewhat connected to this: they don't have a very vibrant church community in Scandinavia. There was never this organic religious community to spawn a nonprofit system where responsibility for the underserved could be outsourced.

But the issue  Hobby Lobby raised—that certain contraceptives are abortifacients, or ""abortive pills"" as Mitt Romney <a href=""http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2012/02/romney-calls-morning-after-pills-abortive-says-right-to-worship-god-is-necessity/"">once called them</a>—is one scientists have grappled with in the course of years of research.</p> \n<p>Based on the most recent evidence, their general conclusion is this: while one of the four forms of birth control at issue—the copper IUD<i>—may</i> disrupt the implantation of a fertilized egg when it's used as an emergency contraceptive, the others can't.</p> \n<p><q class=""center"" aria-hidden=""true"">While one of the four at-issue forms of birth control may disrupt THe implantation of a fertilized egg, the others can't</q></p> \n<p>In the view of some religious groups, which see life as beginning at conception, disrupting implantation—when a fertilized egg embeds itself in   the uterine wall—could be considered abortion. But that's not how the international medical establishment sees things. Here's why.</p> \n<h3>How emergency contraceptives work</h3> \n<p>The groups that brought the case against the birth control mandate opposed the mandatory coverage of two ""morning after pills"" Plan B and Ella, as well as the intrauterine devices ParaGard and Mirena.</p> \n<p>There's a definitive body of research showing that the morning-after pill doesn't stop  fertilized eggs from implanting on   the uterine wall, <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/06/health/research/morning-after-pills-dont-block-implantation-science-suggests.html?pagewanted=all"">despite what their labels</a> say. That's because they work pre-fertilization, which is <span>why they need to be taken soon after unprotected sex</span>. Plan B and Ella act hormonally, by<span> </span><a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23114735"" style=""line-height: 1.5; background-color: #ffffff;"">preventing or slowing down ovulation</a><span> or by changing the amount and consistency of cervical mucus to create an environment where sperm will not survive. When taken too late</span><span>, after ovulation or fertilization, <a href=""http://humupd.oxfordjournals.org/content/10/4/341.full"">these medicines</a> don't work.</span> (It's important to note that Mirena also acts hormonally, but unlike the other two ""morning-after pills,"" it's an IUD used for regular and not emergency contraception.)</p> \n<p>That leaves the ParaGard, a copper device and the only IUD approved by the FDA for emergency contraception as well as regular birth control. It works differently than the latter three contraceptives. And that's why researchers haven't been able to rule out the possibility that it prevents a fertilized egg from implanting on the uterine wall.</p> \n<p>Unlike the morning-after pill, ParaGard is hormone-free: it works locally and can have an effect <i>after</i> fertilization has occurred. When it's used for regular birth control, it mainly prevents sperm from fertilizing an egg by creating a toxic environment in the uterus where these gametes can't survive. But when the T-shaped, copper device is inserted  into a woman's uterus in emergencies, fertilization may have already  occurred. <a href=""http://www.medicine.uiowa.edu/dept_primary_apr.aspx?appointment=Pharmacology&amp;id=ascolim"">Dr. Mario Ascoli</a>,   a professor of pharmacology at the University of Iowa, explained that  since copper is toxic to sperm and eggs, it could be  toxic to a  fertilized egg already present when the IUD was inserted. ""In   some people, it may actually <a href=""http://www.paragard.com/Pdf/ParaGard_full_brochure.pdf"">have an effect on</a> implantation—but only   when it's used for emergency contraception.""</p> \n<p>This is why it's considered the most effective form of emergency contraception, and why groups like Hobby Lobby don't want to cover it. Still, according to <a href=""http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010782407000819"">recent studies</a> on the copper IUD, stopping pregnancy by preventing implantation is a  very uncommon method of action.</p> \n<p><q class=""center"" aria-hidden=""true"">""In some people, [copper iud's] could have an effect on implantation""</q></p> \n<p><span>Scientists and religious groups have different definitions of pregnancy</span></p> \n<p>This science didn't stop the folks behind Hobby Lobby from making their case. But that's because the debate is not really about science; it's about the fundamental question of when pregnancy begins and when society should intervene to protect human life.</p> \n<p>According to federal regulations, pregnancy starts later, after implantation when the embryo has already found a home in the lining of a woman's uterus. This view is supported by the American Medical Association, the American Congress of Obstetricians and the National Institutes of Health, among other science-based groups. Based on this definition, medicines like ParaGard, Ella, and Plan B were approved as <i>contraceptives</i> and not <i>abortifacients</i>. (The only drug approved to induce abortion is RU-486.)</p> \n<p>For others, including some religious conservatives, pregnancy starts early on with conception: when the sperm fertilizes an egg. So that pre-implantation ball of cells, which has about a 20 percent chance of survival, is a nascent life. Anything that curbs its potential for growth, under this view, is considered the termination of a  pregnancy.<span> </span></p> \n<p><span>So if you believe that pregnancy begins when egg and sperm swap genetic material—which, again, is not how the scientific establishment views this—an emergency contraceptive that possibly prevents implantation could be considered a pregnancy ended. It also means that research hasn't completely ruled out the possibility that ParaGard, the copper IUD, could cause that ending. <br></span></p>"

The samples were taken during flu season, which may have prompted people to use more hand sanitizer. It was also cold outside, when many folks wear gloves. This means the hospital surfaces may be even dirtier than the researchers found. On the other hand, since influenza was in full swing, there may have been more hospital traffic than usual, which would also bias the research.</p> \n<p dir=""ltr""><q class=""left"" aria-hidden=""true"">the kinds of bacteria the researchers found are unlikely to make people sick</q>But there's some good news: the kinds of bacteria the researchers found had ""low pathogenicity,"" meaning they are unlikely to make people sick.</p> \n<p>That doesn't mean they're not possible vectors of disease, however. ""Patients remain at potential risk of cross-contamination because of the frequent use of these buttons by diverse individuals,"" the study authors wrote. ""In addition, a visitor is more likely to come into contact with an elevator button or a toilet than with inanimate hospital equipment and may transmit organisms if interacting with inpatients.""</p> \n<p>So the researchers offered a few solutions: place alcohol-based hand sanitizers outside elevators, enlarge elevator buttons so that people can use their elbows to push them, or make the elevator experience touchless.</p> \n<p>Interestingly, while they found elevator buttons were dirtier than toilets, they were actually cleaner than <a href=""http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/502200"">hospital computer-keyboards</a> and <a href=""http://www.clinicalradiologyonline.net/article/S0009-9260%2807%2900029-3/abstract"">ultrasound transducers</a>.

It shows that the government is expected to spend about $50 billion less paying for the Medicare program this year than it had expected to just four years ago.</span></p> \n<p><img src=""http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/assets/4729156/BsG2zuGCQAAzT5G.jpg"" class=""photo"" alt=""Bsg2zugcqaazt5g""> What this chart shows is how much the Congressional Budget Office expects we'll need to pay for each and every Medicare beneficiary. And over the past four years, the forecasting agency has consistently downgraded the price of covering one senior's health care costs.</p> \n<p>Saving $1,000 per patient adds up quickly in a program that covers about 50 million people. More precisely, it adds up to about $50 billion in savings this year. The reduction in expected costs grows to $2,369 in 2019. With an expected 60 million seniors enrolled in Medicare that year, it would work out to more than <a href=""http://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/NationalHealthExpendData/downloads/NhEprojections2009to2019.pdf"">$120 billion</a> shaved off the total cost of the program.</p> \n<p>""The numbers are impressive, and the consecutive year-to-year reductions in projected Medicare spending are unprecedented,"" Kaiser Family Foundation's Tricia Neuman and Juliette Cubanski, who drew up the above chart, write. ""The unexpected $1,000 per beneficiary reduction in spending this year may ease short-term budgetary pressures on Medicare and could provide an opportunity for thoughtful consideration of ways to bolster the program for an aging population.""</p> \n<p>As to what is driving the lower than expected spending, that's not completely clear. But Neuman and Cubanski have a few guesses.</p> \n<h3>Unnecessary readmissions are dropping</h3> \n<p>Unnecessary readmissions — when someone turns up at the hospital a second time because something went wrong on the first visit — are bad for patients and for budgets.</p> \n<p>The good news on unnecessary readmissions is they're becoming less frequent among Medicare patients, a drop that started at just about the same time as CBO began revising downward the cost of covering a Medicare patient.</p> \n<div style=""text-align:center""> \n<p><img src=""http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/assets/4416961/readmission_rates.png"" class=""photo"" alt=""Readmission_rates""></p> \n</div> \n<p>When there are fewer trips to the hospital, insurance coverage becomes, unsurprisingly, less expensive — and that could be part of the explanation for the downward changes.</p> \n<h3>Obamacare changed the way doctors get paid</h3> \n<p>The health care law included lots of <a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/how-doctors-are-paid/how-are-us-doctors-paid-today"">changes</a> to the way that doctors get paid within the Medicare program, all aimed at getting doctors to provide better care at lower costs. That's true, for example, with <a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/how-doctors-are-paid/what-is-the-readmission-penalty"">readmissions</a>: Obamacare now penalizes hospitals when their patient shows up for a second visit that didn't need to happen, if everything had gone right the first time.</p> \n<p>There are dozens of changes like this that could be playing a role in explaining why Medicare may cost significantly less than initially expected. This theory, as Neuman and Cubanksi acknowledge, is still somewhat speculative. Some of these programs didn't start until 2012, which makes it difficult to attribute the revised estimates in 2010 and 2011 to health reform.</p> \n<h3>The sequester cut Medicare doctor payments</h3> \n<p>The Budget Control Act of 2011 included a 2 percent cut to Medicare doctor payments. This was significantly less than the across-the-board spending reductions of 8.6 percent that other federal agencies saw, but it might have played a role in the downward revision between 2010 and 2011.</p> \n<p>Again though, its not a full explanation: CBO knew about the sequester in every forecast after 2011. So the agency thinks something else is going on that would drive down Medicare costs even further than the BCA can explain.</p> \n<p>Without any clear explanation of why expected Medicare cost growth has slowed so much, Neuman and Cubanksi dub it a bit of a ""mystery"" — one that has incredibly good implications for the budget.</p> \n<p>""Whatever the causes may be, the slowdown in spending is good news for Medicare, the federal budget and for beneficiaries-at least for now, and as long as it does not adversely affect access to or quality of care,"" they write. ""Lower costs lead directly to lower Medicare premiums and cost sharing.""</p>"

Many enrolled in plans with <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2014/01/13/obamacares-narrow-networks-are-going-to-make-people-furious-but-they-might-control-costs/"">narrow networks,</a> which limit which doctors and hospitals patients can see, restrictions that can frustrate subscribers.

In this Commonwealth Fund survey, conducted between April and June of this year, that number had fallen to 15 percent. That works out to about 9.5 million adults gaining coverage (that figure does not include children).</p> \n<p>The biggest gains in coverage were among young adults, whose uninsured rate fell by 28 percent.

On the X-axis is per-capita ad dollars spent on anti-Obamacare ads.</p> \n<p>There's generally a positive relationship between more anti-Obamacare ad dollars and a better enrollment ratio. ""After controlling for other state characteristics such as low per capita income population and average insurance premiums, I observe a positive association between the anti-ACA spending and ACA enrollment,"" Yaraghi writes.</p> \n<p>Anti-Obamacare ads certainly aren't the only reason people signed up for health insurance.

One that Yaraghi suggests is that the attacks could have raised awareness about the health care law, letting people know that ""a governmentally subsidized service"" was new and available. It's also possible that they made the future of Obamacare seem more uncertain, which could encourage people to sign up quickly.</p> \n<p>""People who believe that subsidized health insurance may soon disappear,"" Yaraghi writes, ""Could have a greater willingness to take advantage of this one time opportunity.""</p> \n<p>And that means that the Koch brothers, who spent an estimated <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/fact-checker/wp/2014/04/04/billions-spent-on-attacking-obamacare/"">$30 million </a>on ads opposing Obamacare, might have actually had a hand in getting people signed up for insurance coverage.</p>"

People are are higher risk if they have a family history of these conditions, if they smoke, or if they have high blood pressure, high cholesterol or diabetes.</p> \n<p>When prescribed by a doctor to reduce these risks, aspirin is available without a copay to adults aged <a href=""https://member.carefirst.com/carefirst-resources/pdf/affordable-care-act-preferred-preventive-drug-list.pdf"">45 and older</a> (younger people are not considered at high risk).</p> \n<h3>4) Smoking cessation</h3> \n<p>Obamacare requires that insurers cover treatments  that help people quit smoking, like nicotine patches and chewing gum. This aims to reduce future expenses related to lung cancer and other diseases associated with tobacco use.</p> \n<p>Getting over-the-counter treatments without a co-pay might be more complicated than just showing your insurance card at the register. You may, for example, need to request an <a href=""http://hr.umich.edu/uhrnews/?p=1224"">authorization letter</a> from your insurer that you can present at the pharmacy.</p> \n<h3>5) HIV testing</h3> \n<p>Everyone ages 15 to 65 is eligible for free HIV testing. If a patient is outside of that age range but might at <a href=""http://healthfinder.gov/HealthTopics/Category/health-conditions-and-diseases/hiv-and-other-stds/get-tested-for-hiv"">high risk</a> of HIV transmission, testing is free for you, too.</p> \n<p>The law also requires insurers to cover syphilis testing without co-payh for high-risk individuals. Other STD testing <a href=""https://www.healthcare.gov/what-are-my-preventive-care-benefits/#part=1"">isn't covered</a> as a free preventive service, but counseling to prevent STDs is.</p> \n<h3>6) Alcohol counseling</h3> \n<p>Excessive drinking causes <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/6/27/5846480/excessive-drinking-causes-1-in-10-deaths-among-working-age-adults"">1 in 10 deaths</a> among working-age adults. Obamacare requires insurer to cover screening for alcohol misuse, and counseling from a physician where it's needed.</p> \n<p>""Counseling for five, 10, 15 minutes can result in a substantial reduction in problem-drinking,"" Thomas Frieden, director for the Centers for Disease Control, <a href=""http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/01/07/us-usa-health-alcohol-idUSBREA0612320140107"">said in January</a>.</p> \n<h3>7) Obesity counseling</h3> \n<p>Health reform similarly requires insurers to cover screening and counseling for obesity. Counseling might involve weight loss and nutritional recommendations. Physicians might recommend more intensive interventions for patients who are very overweight; it's up to the insurer whether the patient is responsible for out-of-pocket costs related to those services.</p> \n<h3>Some caveats</h3> \n<p><span>Obamacare doesn't mean you can walk into any pharmacy and demand a free flu shot, or Nicorette.</span></p> \n<p>To take advantage the preventive care covered without co-pay, you'll need to visit health care providers in your insurer's network — the doctors your insurance plan has contracted with. The new Obamacare rules only apply to in-network care.</p> \n<p>If you have the same insurance plan you had on or before March 23, 2010, your plan may be considered ""<a href=""https://www.healthcare.gov/what-if-i-have-a-grandfathered-health-plan/"">grandfathered</a>"" and might not be subject to the same rules as insurance plans created after the Affordable Care Act was passed.

This change effected a few million people.</p> \n<p>Delays to the employer mandate are arguably the largest deviation from an Affordable Care Act deadline. There, the White House decided in <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/07/02/white-house-delays-employer-mandate-requirement-until-2015/"">July 2013 </a>that it would not enforce the requirement that all large businesses provide insurance to their employees in 2014.

Legislation is often a broader blueprint with a particular policy goal in mind — in the case of the Affordable Care Act, for example, expanding access to insurance.

""In an individual case we might say, its not worth the hassle for enforcement.

There's a possible future where the delay could, in fact, be illegal — but, with no plaintiff able to claim standing, it is left in place.</p> \n<p>""There's a principle of our constitutional system that goes back to the Marbury v. Madison decision that says there are some illegal, and even constitutional violations, that are not justiciable,"" says Jon Siegel, an expert on administrative law at George Washington University's School of Law. It's not enough to say you think the president did something illegal. There has to be someone who was actually harmed by that illegal action.""</p>"
Fighting 'churn': The less-noticed way that Obamacare reduces the uninsured rate,http://www.vox.com/2014/7/13/5891109/obamacare-reduce-churn-health-insurance,People become uninsured all the time.

But that misses a big part of the story. In addition to making insurance more affordable and accessible to those who didn't have coverage before, Obamacare should reduce the number of people who </span><i style=""line-height: 1.5;"">become uninsured</i><span> in the first place, after losing a job and benefits, for example.</span></p> \n<p>Insurance status changes like this all of the time, a phenomenon known by health wonks as ""churn"". Between 2004 and 2005, for example, the insurance rate stayed roughly the same.</p> \n<p>But that also masks a change in health insurance status for lots and lots of people. About 10 million people became uninsured from 2004 to 2005, John A. Graves, a professor of health policy at Vanderbilt University, <a href=""https://twitter.com/johngraves9/status/445581132575174658"">found</a><span>.

""Some of that will still happen, but I think it will be minimized.""</p> \n<p>This is a more subtle effect of Obamacare, and it'll take longer to suss out the full extent of the law's effect.</p> \n<p>""It's too early to know how successful the ACA is going to be at reducing churn, because it depends a lot on people's behavior,"" Levitt said. ""But there's the potential to change the culture of health insurance. It's possible that once we get people into the insurance system, they'll be less likely to leave when their circumstances change.""</p>"

Glenn Cohen: There are different definitions, but essentially ""big data"" in health care refers to the idea — particularly with the shift to electronic health records — that we have millions and millions of patient records that are now in the process of being digitized, as well as tons of information from genetic samples, tissue samples, and the like. Increasingly, we're able to combine these records for analysis.</p> \n<p>It's now possible to aggregate data from millions and millions of patient experiences, and to use that information to reform our health care system and make individualized patient decisions and do research.</p> \n<p>One way big data is emerging is predictive analytics, which uses an algorithms to analyze data and generate suggestions for the future health of a particular patient — to decide whether a specific patient should be admitted to the intensive care unit or not, for example.</p> \n<p><b>AM: In the paper, you say that big data in health care seems to exist in this kind of gray area between ""quality improvement,"" which doesn't require explicit consent to use people's data, and ""human subjects research,"" which does. That </b><b style=""line-height: 1.5;"">gray area has gotten a lot of attention recently, with the controversy over <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/6/30/5856938/the-facebook-study-wasnt-just-creepy-it-was-bad-research"">Facebook's emotions study</a>. Are there parallels we can draw here?</b></p> \n<p>IGC: I was actually asked about Facebook at the Health Affairs briefing. I'm paraphrasing here, but the question was something like, ""Cohen, aren't you being a little silly to be talking about all of these kinds of entities — HIPAA, the health privacy law — when corporations like Walmart and Facebook know an awful lot about us, and they're not governed by any of these laws?""</p> \n<p>What I said to the gentleman who asked is that this is an argument for asymmetry. You have A and B — health care systems and Facebook — who look very similar in the way the know information about us, and one is heavily regulated and one is not.</p> \n<p>The way you can resolve that kind of argument is in either direction: it either means we should treat health care practitioners of the world more like Facebook — let them set their own terms of use, no regulation of what's done — or, we could treat the Facebooks of the world more like health care and apply a whole set of rules about de-identification of data and consent and the like.</p> \n<p>The other possibility is that there are significant differences between the two, such that different regulatory regimes are appropriate. I think I fall somewhere in that middle.</p> \n<p><q class=""center"" aria-hidden=""true"">""In health care, the person you share data with is supposed to have your best interests at heart. Facebook is not the same.""<br></q></p> \n<p>I think the relationship you have with a doctor is a special relationship. You are sharing health information with the view that this person is looking out for your best interests. They're paid, but we have a whole bunch of regulations in place to make sure that health care professionals don't act out of their own interests instead of the interests of their patients. It seems to me that Facebook is not the same kind of relationship, and we've never pretended otherwise.</p> \n<p>I do think there is a crucial difference in that part of what we're trying to do in health care is make sure people trust their doctors. Protections exist in health care — but not for Facebook — in part because we've established this particular kind of relationship where the person you're sharing your information with is only supposed to have your best interests at heart.</p> \n<p>If you believe that about Facebook, I think you have bigger problems.</p> \n<p><b>AM: So, how do we navigate the consent issue for collection and use of personal data in health care — and, eventually, the predictive analytics models that could help doctors make treatment decisions?</b></p> \n<p><b></b><span>IGC: The way I think about this is a little bit like a see-saw, where you have consent on the one side and privacy and de-identification on the other side. The more we invade your privacy, the more we need robust consent mechanisms. I think of privacy as your right to stop people from knowing things about you that you don't want them to know — things that can be tied directly to your identity as an individual.</span></p> \n<p>The federal system of privacy regulation adopts a similar philosophy: It demarcates 18 identifiers that have to be stripped from health information about a patient before you can transfer data between covered entities. After stripping those identifiers, consent is not necessarily required to use that data for some kinds of research.</p> \n<p>To me, nothing is ever truly de-identified. We've had studies that have taken random genetic samples, and with very little additional information — like just the zip code — they've been able to <a href=""http://www.sciencemag.org/content/339/6117/321.abstract"">reverse-engineer</a> the identities of research subjects.</p> \n<p><q class=""center"" aria-hidden=""true"">""Nothing is ever truly de-identified — but 'big data' could make de-identification easier.""</q></p> \n<p>That said, it requires a lot of expertise and a lot of money, and we don't think that people will routinely do this. But we think the development of these ""big data"" datasets and algorithms could actually make de-identification easier.</p> \n<p>Our ability to de-identify data exists on a continuum. But the closer you get to an acceptable level of de-identification — where someone would have to do a lot to re-identify you — the more ethical it seems to me that this proceed without individual consent.</p> \n<p>Even then, we suggest that even then, it maybe be paired with other kinds of assurances, like auditing by third-party institutions that we trust, protections like the ones that exist when people have their identities stolen, legal remedies if there is a data breach, and also the kind of naming-and-shaming techniques that have been used against Target and other institutions in the wake of data breaches.</p> \n<p><q class=""right"" aria-hidden=""true"">""THE COSTS OF REAL, MEANINGFUL CONSENT ARE too GREAT.""</q></p> \n<p>The bottom line is, if I were to require your explicit consent each and every time I recorded something into your electronic health record, to share it with the database and the algorithms, essentially this technology would not work, because the costs of doing real, meaningful consent are too great.</p> \n<p>What we think instead would be more reasonable is that when you enter a practice, there should be notification and an informational session — interactive and ongoing, where it's not just signing a piece of paper, but you are made to understand what it really means to have this information shared in the database, and maybe an opportunity to opt out.</p> \n<p><b style=""font-weight: bold;"">AM: One problem your paper talks about is that these predictive analytics might make patients that are already marginalized by the health care system — people who are disadvantaged </b><b>because of illness, lack of access to health care, or poverty— </b><b style=""font-weight: bold; font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.5;"">worse off.</b></p> \n<p>IGC: In order to do ""big data"" properly, you want huge networks of electronic health records to get the data from, and you want to make sure you have a diverse population that reflects the diversity of the United States. We want to get everyone involved in contributing their data.</p> \n<p><q class=""right"" aria-hidden=""true"">""Those who contribute ought to be able to benefit."" </q></p> \n<p>But most of the predictive analytics engines that are being developed are being developed by for-profit corporations. Ultimately, those corporations are hoping to sell what they do with these algorithms to individual hospitals or hospital systems.</p> \n<p>One of our concerns is that resource-constrained hospitals — and patients who go to resource-constrained hospitals — their data may go toward building the system, but they may not enjoy the benefits of the system because their particular hospital can't afford or chooses not to buy these kinds of technology.</p> \n<p>A lot of onus is going to fall on state, local, and federal government to subsidize the acquisition of these kinds of models if they show themselves to be effective in resource-poor settings. But we also think that the developers of these model may have an ethical obligation to adopt graduated licensing, similar to what some pharmaceutical companies have done to improve the availability of drugs in the developing world.</p> \n<p>We think that basically those who contribute to the development of the model ought to be able to benefit from the use of that model. We have a fear that may not happen without these kinds of interventions.</p> \n<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>AM: Are there ways that the data could be used more actively to the detriment of high-need patients? </b></p> \n<p>IGC: This kind of big data has the potential to allow insurers or medical providers to develop strategies to avoid high-cost patients. The idea is that, given enough data, I can spot you without using the old-fashioned categories that run into problems, like race, socioeconomic status, age and the like — law prohibits using that information on anti-discrimination laws. But in the future, I might be able to spot you through sophisticated data-mining.</p> \n<p><q class=""center"" aria-hidden=""true"">""there could be people who want to use the data for purposes that widen health disparities, not solve them.""</q></p> \n<p>My take on this is that before the Affordable Care Act, I would have been much more worried about this. After the Affordable Care Act, we have beefed up anti-discrimination rules for insurers and we also have other laws like the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA), which prohibits certain forms of discrimination based on genetic data. So, I think this is a real concern, but recent legislative efforts have made me more comfortable with the notion.</p> \n<p>But it's definitely true that with this system, somebody who wants to use the system will be able to know a lot more about you and the likely future of your health state than they could know now. I imagine even with these legal protections, there could be some entities or people who want to use the data for purposes that will widen health disparities, not solve them.</p>"

He made the case there was no way that the Obama administration could fix the Helathcare.gov mess legally.</p> \n<p>""It can only be fixed by breaking the law-the 'settled law' Democrats seem so fond of these days,"" he writes there. ""Someone has to decide which rules and regulations to ignore and which to enforce, which to enact and which to delay, who is to be exempted and who is to be railroaded.""</p> \n<p>Frezza's warning was among a chorus of the<a href=""http://www.arnoldkling.com/blog/when-will-the-aca-exchanges-be-working/""> first wave of failure predictions</a>: that Healthcare.gov wouldn't be fixed any time soon — if ever.</p> \n<p>Healthcare.gov was definitely a disaster during its first two months; only six people managed to sign up on its first day. But it was essentially fixed by the end of November, when most people were able to use the website to purchase health insurance coverage. <a href=""http://time.com/10228/obamas-trauma-team/"">As recounted in Steve Brill's Time magazine cover</a>, the story behind Healthcare.gov's turn around was a bunch of tech geeks getting into a room and figuring out how to make a website work. It wasn't about throwing rules overboard.</p> \n<h3>2) Even if the website works, nobody wants to buy Obamacare</h3> \n<h3><img style=""font-family: 'Alright Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 15.555556297302246px; line-height: 1.5;"" alt=""2555313"" class=""photo"" src=""http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/assets/4755668/2555313.jpg""></h3> \n<p class=""caption"">(William Thomas Cain / Getty Images News)</p> \n<p><span>Rush Limbaugh predicted on his </span><a style=""line-height: 1.5; background-color: #ffffff;"" href=""http://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2013/10/24/america_isn_t_signing_up_for_obamacare"">October 24</a><span> that Americans would never sign up for the insurance expansion, regardless of whether Healthcare.gov got fixed. He pointed to states like New  York that had functional websites yet, in the first month of open enrollment, few sign-ups.</span></p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""right"">Limbaugh predicted, even if Healthcare.gov worked, shoppers wouldn't buy.</q></p> \n<p><span>""There are states out there that are not having any troubles whatsoever on their websites for people to get health insurance,"" Limbaugh says in the same show. ""The thing remarkable about those states is nobody's signing up.  New York state, nobody has gone to that website to sign up.""</span></p> \n<p>About 8 million people signed up for private insurance coverage. This likely had to do with the fact the law has lots of strong incentives to purchase insurance, from government subsidies to a mandate that most Americans need to carry coverage.</p> \n<p>It was hard to sign up for Obamacare. But what too many insured pundits forgot is it's much worse to be uninsured, or underinsured. And that's true, too, for the people who saw their plans canceled by Obamacare and then needed to decide whether to sign up for a new one.</p> \n<h3><span>3) Obamacare definitely won't meet its enrollment goal</span></h3> \n<p><span>""At this pace, the Obama administration will never be able to meet their enrollment goals,"" Sen. Orrin Hatch's office declared in </span><span>(R-Utah) a November 13 press release. </span><span>The senator described the 106,000 enrollees as ""a far cry from the hundreds of thousands of Americans the Administration said would sign-up for ObamaCare by the end of the month.</span></p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""left"">people who couldn't buy in october seemed to come back in march</q></p> \n<p>The disparity between the Obama administration's projected sign-ups — and the actual people enrolling in coverage — persisted through the end of 2013, as did predictions that the 7 million enrollees goal was unattainable. As my then-colleague at the Washington Post (and now colleague here at Vox) Ezra Klein <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/11/26/obamacare-wont-get-7-million-enrollees-in-2014-and-thats-okay/"">wrote</a> in November, ""Obamacare won't get 7 million enrollees in 2014 — and that's okay.""</p> \n<p>Those predictions ultimately missed the surge in sign-ups that would happen in late March. When it came down to March 31 the deadline to purchase insurance coverage, lots of shoppers rushed to buy coverage.</p> \n<p><img src=""http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/assets/4760052/enrollment.png"" class=""photo"" alt=""Enrollment""></p> \n<p>It wasn't that Obamacare missed its sign-up targets.

Nobody new would actually gain private insurance.</p> \n<p>""What you have basically done is a churn where you've knocked people off their old insurance and then gotten them on the exchanges,"" the National Review's Rich Lowry argued on Meet the Press. ""There's not much upside to that.""</p> \n<p><span>Much of this prediction was fueled by an early report from the consulting firm McKinsey, which showed only one in ten Obamacare enrollees were newly insured.</span></p> \n<p>Subsequent data, from McKinsey and other groups suggests that a larger chunk of exchange enrollees were gaining new insurance coverage.</p> \n<p><img alt=""Exchange_enrollees"" class=""photo"" src=""http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/assets/4635145/exchange_enrollees.png""></p> \n<p>The estimates range between different surveys for reasons explained <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/6/19/5821662/survey-57-percent-of-obamacare-enrollees-were-previously-uninsured"">here</a>. There is definitely a sizable population of exchange enrollees lacked insurance coverage prior to signing up through Healthcare.gov or a state exchange.</p> \n<h3>5) Obamacare would cause a net-loss of insurance</h3> \n<p>House Speaker John Boehner argued in March that it was possible fewer people had health insurance after the health law's insurance expansion than prior to it.</p> \n<p><span>He said there that the most recently available data would indicate ""indicate to me a net loss of people with health insurance. And I actually do believe that to be the case.""'</span></p> \n<p>The math behind his statement: Obamacare had, at that point, 4.2 million enrollees in the the exchanges. An estimated 6 million people had received cancellation notices from the plans they used to — ergo, there were more people receiving cancellation notices than signing up for Obamacare.</p> \n<p>What that misses, however, are the people who were purchasing insurance outside of the marketplace. Shoppers who didn't qualify for subsidies could access the exact same insurance plans with fewer technical glitches by going to an insurance broker.</p> \n<p>It also completely ignores Medicaid, which has expanded by 6.7 million enrollees since September. All available data very strongly suggests that Obamacare has led to a significant net decrease in the number of Americans who lack insurance coverage.</p> \n<p><img alt=""Insured"" class=""photo"" src=""http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/assets/4738240/insured.png""></p> \n<h3>6) Premiums will skyrocket</h3> \n<p>About this time last year, there were lots of predictions that some people who buy their own health insurance would see their rates <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/special-report/2014/obamacare_map/index.html#"">more than double</a> under Obamacare. Then these predictions showed up again for 2015 rates, with headlines like ""<a href=""http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/201136-obamacare-premiums-are-about-to-skyrocket"">O-Care Premiums to Skyrocket</a>.""</p> \n<p>What actually happened with health insurance premiums was much more modest. Prices on the exchange for this year actually came in <a href=""http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/07/18/us-usa-healthcare-costs-idUSBRE96H0UM20130718"">18 percent </a>lower than budget forecasters had initially expected.</p> \n<p>Prices for people who were already buying insurance did go up this year, by an estimated <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/6/18/5818988/obamacares-sticker-shock-is-real-but-its-not-as-bad-as-advertised"">14 to 28 percent</a>. That figure doesn't include any subsidies that some low and middle-income shoppers are getting to help offset the costs.</p> \n<p>As for 2015, consulting firm Avalere Health has found insurers to submit ""modest"" rate increases that range significantly by state.</p> \n<p><img src=""http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/assets/4759916/premiums.png"" class=""photo"" alt=""Premiums""></p> \n<p>Insurance premiums will go up in most places in 2015, just like they did before Obamacare.

One is the uninsured rate, which seems to have fallen since the health care law's insurance expansion started.</p> \n<p>Another is access to health care — an insurance card isn't much fun if it can't help get an appointment with a doctor. On this front, preliminary data also seems to suggest Obamacare is working: a recent Commonwealth Fund survey <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/7/10/5887105/for-millions-who-signed-up-obamacare-is-working?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_campaign=mattyglesias&amp;utm_content=thursday"">shows</a> that most enrollees say they can get an appointment within two weeks.    <img src=""http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/assets/4734886/commonwealth5.png"" class=""photo"" alt=""Commonwealth5""></p> \n<p>Last, the health care law also aimed to control health spending growth. This is one area where there's just not a lot of data yet. We know that Obamacare has coincided with a period of real slow health cost growth, although whether it <i>caused </i>that slow growth is really hard to tell at this point.</p> \n<p>But where there is data, it tends to suggest that Obamacare is doing what it was meant to do  — and not realizing the disastrous Obamacare predictions.</p>"

It's unclear, for instance, why bisexual Americans in particular seem to have worse access to health care than the rest of the population.</p> \n<p>Some of the findings for physical fitness among gay and bisexual men could have roots in what is actually a problem in the community: the prominence of body image issues and body shaming. <a href=""http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/04/070413160923.htm"">A 2007 study</a> found 15 percent of gay or bisexual men suffered from an eating disorder at some point, compared to 5 percent of straight men. As psychotherapist Matthew Dempsey explained in <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53K4p3lkYyE"">a video</a>, gay and bisexual men may focus so much on their body image to mask deeper feelings of inadequacy and even shame about their sexual orientation.</p> \n<p>Many of the questions raised by the survey simply don't have answers yet. The report states that, with this data, researchers at least have a starting point on which to base future investigations.</p>"

""In that context, it doesn't look like such a bad deal.""</span></p> \n<p>Economists argue that there's a tension in setting the price for a breakthrough drug like Sovaldi. We want to encourage more pharmaceutical companies to pursue similarly big developments — a cure for Alzheimer's, for example, or diabetes — but also want patients to have access to those treatments. When push comes to shove though, many prefer that we err on the side of higher prices as a way to encourage other big, blockbuster drugs in the future.</p> \n<h3><span>Sovaldi is a breakthrough medical treatment</span></h3> \n<p><img src=""http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/assets/4765854/487287747.jpg"" class=""photo"" alt=""487287747""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">French activists protest the price of Gilead's new Hepatitis C treatment (Sylvain Golden / AFP)</p> \n<p>Hepatitis C can be a a completely manageable condition for some patients – and debilitating for others.

Sovaldi is a cure: in </span><a href=""http://seekingalpha.com/article/2007521-the-hep-c-race-is-heating-up-abbvie-vs-gilead"">97 percent </a><span>of cases, it eliminates the Hepatitis C virus altogether. That could prevent the need for liver transplants in more severe cases, which can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars.</span></p> \n<p><span>The same things that make Sovaldi so important to patients — and groups advocating for access — are what make the drug expensive. Its a breakthrough treatment that's highly valuable. </span></p> \n<h3><span>The economic case for expensive, life-saving drugs</span></h3> \n<p><span>Consumer groups have argued that the importance of this drug is a reason to charge less. But health economists make the opposite case: this is the type of innovation that should net pharmaceutical companies a large pay day, because its so much more meaningful than the drugs that make tiny, incremental advances.</span></p> \n<p>""Pharmaceutical companies get criticized for lots of things like that,"" Craig Garthwaite, a health economist at Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management, says. ""This is an actual innovation, and that is something that they should get a reward for.""</p> \n<p><span> <img src=""http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/assets/4765910/450497420.jpg"" class=""photo"" alt=""450497420""></span></p> \n<p class=""caption"">One very expensive bottle of pills (MCT)</p> \n<p><span>As an economist, Garthwaite worries about what would happen if the price of Sovaldi fell dramatically. The drug would likely become more available to patients — although that looks to be an event in progress already, with some of Gilead's competitors expected to release similar Hepatitis C treatments within the next week.</span></p> \n<p>The incentive for companies to create really blockbuster, breakthrough treatments would be smaller. Pharmaceutical companies are not, to nobody's surprise, benevolent non-profits. They're in the drug-making business to for the big paydays that come with a medication like Sovaldi.</p> \n<p>""It becomes a policy question, of what we're willing to trade for less innovation,"" he says. ""We have to be very careful because the benefits to innovation are huge. And this is really the hardest question we have in health economics is this efficiency dilemma.""</p> \n<p><span>The hard question to answer here is how much a pharmaceutical company — Gilead or otherwise — needs to net in reward to keep pursuing big, innovative drugs. Would a $40,000 price tag be enough? What about $60,000? The company is, after all, selling the drug for just </span><a href=""http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-04-10/emerging-markets-pay-1-of-u-s-price-for-gilead-sovaldi.html"">$900</a> some<span> developing countries like Egypt. Why can't Americans have the same deal?</span></p> \n<p><span>The health economists I spoke acknowledged this was a difficult problem, but generally preferred to err on the side of slightly overpaying, largely out of worry about the effect of undercutting innovation. The higher prices that the United States pays, their argument goes, is what makes it desirable to keep developing really blockbuster drugs — particularly those that patients won't have to take forever.</span></p> \n<p><q class=""left"" aria-hidden=""true"">what type of profits does pharma need to keep pursuing big, innovative drugs?</q></p> \n<p>""They're developing a product that's a cure that will essentially put their own treatments out of business,"" USC's Goldman says. ""We'd love for pharmaceutical companies to come up with a treatment that cures diabetes rather than just treats it. I want to pay them enough so it's possible they'll start working on cures rather than treatments.""</p> \n<p>Sovaldi could have decided to price its drug at $40,000, as advocates would like. It could have also, hypothetically, gone higher (one J.P. Morgan analyst estimated in 2013 that Gilead could sell Sovaldi for upwards of a half-million). Gilead doesn't release internal discussions on drug pricing, but its likely that the company decided $84,000 is what the market here would pay for its new treatment.</p> \n<p>At the end of the day, insurers and Medicaid agencies have the final trump card here. They could put their foot down, deny coverage for the drug and let massive protests from patients' ensue. But they haven't done that: while many publicly oppose the high price, they have also decided its something they need to offer patients. And, even though they don't like the high price for Sovaldi, at the end of the day, they're willing to pay for the value it provides.</p>"

If a student has asthma, a smoking parent can make the symptoms of the illness much worse — especially if, as is too common in low-income households, the asthma isn't being fully treated in the first place.</p> \n<h3>3) Middle-aged people are more likely to smoke<br>\n</h3> \n<center> \n<p><img src=""http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/assets/4778170/smoking_age.png"" class=""photo"" alt=""Smoking_age""></p> \n</center> \n<p>Younger people are much less likely to smoke, perhaps due to the strong public health campaigns of the 1990s and 2000s. Middle-aged people, on the other hand, can still represent segments of the population from the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s that became addicted before they were aware of the dangers of smoking. Older people, meanwhile, might quit smoking to avoid exacerbating health problems brought on by age.</p> \n<h3>4) People who are gay, lesbian, and bisexual are more likely to smoke</h3> \n<center> \n<p><img src=""http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/assets/4778186/smoking_sexual_orientation.png"" class=""photo"" alt=""Smoking_sexual_orientation""></p> \n</center> \n<p>It's not completely clear why gay, lesbian, and bisexual people appear to smoke more.</p> \n<p>One possible explanation: these numbers simply reflect poverty trends. The Williams Institute <a href=""http://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/LGB-Poverty-Update-Jun-2013.pdf"">found</a> gay, lesbian, and particularly bisexual people are more vulnerable to poverty than their straight counterparts. Higher smoking rates among different sexual orientations correlate with those higher poverty rates.</p> \n<p>Whatever the cause, bisexual Americans also seem to share <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/7/15/5901403/gay-lesbian-bisexual-straight-health-federal-survey-report"">a few other worrying health trends</a>: less access to health care, lower rates of vaccination, and, in the case of bisexual women, higher obesity rates.</p> \n<h3>5) People in Kentucky, West Virginia, and Arkansas smoke a lot<br>\n</h3> \n<center> \n<p><img src=""http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/assets/4778426/smoking_states.png"" class=""photo"" alt=""Smoking_states""></p> \n</center> \n<p>In many ways, this map shows the other factors on this list. Kentucky, West Virginia, and Arkansas, for instance, <a href=""http://247wallst.com/special-report/2013/09/19/americas-richest-and-poorest-states/6/"">have some of the highest poverty rates in the country</a>.</p> \n<p>Kentucky also accounts for more than half of tobacco production in the US. Since it's such a huge local industry, Kentuckians might feel more incentive to support tobacco by smoking it. Neighboring West Virginia might feel some of that pressure as well. (Arkansas has no major tobacco operations, so its high degree of use is linked to other factors.)</p> \n<p>As more Americans quit smoking, these are the last segments of the population that the tobacco industry has come to rely on in the US.

Instead, it shows that 4.4 percent of women will give birth at that moment, which is a higher percentage (but certainly not a majority) of any other days in the two-month range.</p> \n<p><a href=""http://www.bbc.com/news/health-23594668"" style=""line-height: 1.5;"">Separate research</a> has shown that women's gestation periods tend to vary naturally by as much as five weeks.

See CHCF for an <a href=""http://www.chcf.org/publications/2014/07/data-viz-hcc-national"">interactive version</a>.)</p> \n<p>When the chart starts, out-of-pocket payments — the dark orange dominating the chart in the early 1960s — represents almost all of the nation's health care spending. Over time, that shrinks substantially across every kind of health care service.</p> \n<p>Medicare and Medicaid, the nation's two major public health insurance programs, were signed into law in 1965; you can see them appear in 1966 — Medicaid is shaded in dark green, and Medicare is the medium green to the left of Medicaid. <br> <br>Hospital care has consistently commanded the largest share of health spending in the United States. It is also one of the few domains where private insurance has played a consistent role in payment: 36 percent of hospital expenses were paid by private insurance in 1960, and the same proportion is covered by private insurance today. Out-of-pocket payment fell from 21 percent to 3 percent over the same time period, while public insurance (like Medicare and Medicaid) filled the gap.</p> \n<p>Prescription drugs — which make up a 11 percent of health spending now — briefly shrank as a share of total expenses during the '70s and '80s, then rebounded. But while 96 percent of prescriptions were paid for out-of-pocket in 1960, insurance now covers much more; only 18 percent of drug costs were paid out-of-pocket in 2012.</p> \n<p>Under Obamacare, the share of out-of-pocket spending is expected to decrease while Medicaid spending goes up. Independent of health reform, the aging of the population means that Medicare will grow as a share of spending, too.</p>"

Most research shows no correlation between higher quality and better care (the best paper on this is arguably one that Chapin White <a href=""http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/33/2/324"">published </a>in the journal <i>Health Affairs </i>in January).

Insurers are increasing moving towards consumer-directed health plans. These are insurance products where subscribers get a lump sum amount to spend on health care and have to decide the best way to use that pot of money (this is different from what most insurers do now: charge a flat co-pay regardless of the procedure's actual price).</p> \n<p>Most transparency advocates want to pair price data with quality metrics, so patients could better know whether the higher price was actually warranted. This could be some type of pairing of hospital quality rankings, the type that U.S. News and World Report puts out, with prices. That would be a way to get at the value that hospitals provide, and bring some context to which hospitals really can justify charging more than their competitors — because they offer superior services.</p> \n<p>Providing price data alone, however, could lead patients to do the exact opposite of what transparency advocates want: shopping on cost to pick the most expensive, and seemingly best, health care provider.</p>"

How states could get around yesterday's Obamacare ruling,http://www.vox.com/2014/7/23/5929757/states-could-get-around-obamacare-halbig-ruling,A lawsuit could render subsidies illegal in 36 states â€” but there's a workaround.,"<p>Yesterday, a federal appeals court ruled that Obamacare subsidies are illegal in 36 states. Though the problem is abstract for now — the judicial system is going to grapple with this question over the coming months — what happens if the ruling eventually becomes reality?</p> \n<p>Maybe not much.</p> \n<p>The court case, <i>Halbig v. Burwell</i>, centers on whether Obamacare actually authorized the IRS to provide subsidies to buy health insurance on exchanges that are run (or partly run) by the federal government. According to a ruling from the D.C. Circuit Tuesday morning, the answer is no.</p> \n<p>Most people who have followed this case closely — including the lawsuit's chief architects — think the odds of <i>Halbig</i> becoming the law of the land are slim.</p> \n<p>But if it did, it could have potentially disastrous consequences for the 36 states that didn't build their own exchanges. Getting a marketplace up and running is no small task, as difficulties with Oregon, Massachusetts and Healthcare.gov have all shown.</p> \n<p>But there might be an easier way for states to still net subsidies without building an exchange: contract with Health and Human Services to use the federally-established infrastructure for as the backbone of new, ""state-based"" marketplaces.</p> \n<p><q class=""center"" aria-hidden=""true"">""IT'S A MORE AGGRESSIVE INTERPRETATION OF STATUTORY AUTHORITY THAN I MIGHT BE COMFORTABLE WITH, BUT IT'S PLAUSIBLE."" </q></p> \n<p>Obamacare has some rules about who the state can delegate exchange duties to, and those rules would forbid states from contracting <i>directly </i>with Healthcare.gov, but it doesn't foreclose use of the website altogether.</p> \n<p>""A state could, for example, establish an exchange and appoint a state-incorporated entity to oversee and manage it. That state-incorporated entity could then contract with Healthcare.gov to operate the exchange,"" <a href=""http://theincidentaleconomist.com/wordpress/working-around-halbig/"">writes</a> Nicholas Bagley, a law professor at the University of Michigan. ""On the ground, nothing would change. But tax credits would be available where they weren't before.""</p> \n<p>While this would be another example of the executive branch exercising some administrative muscle to ""fix"" a problem with Obamacare, it likely passes legal muster.</p> \n<p>""It's a more aggressive interpretation of statutory authority than I might be comfortable with, but it's plausible,"" says Jonathan Adler, a law professor at Case Western and one of the legal minds behind the case.</p> \n<p>Which poses another question: would all 36 states jump at the opportunity to preserve their residents' subsidies? Probably not. In at least one of the related court cases — <i>Indiana v. Burwell</i> — the administration is being sued directly by a state. Another lawsuit, <i>Pruitt v. Burwell</i>, pits Oklahoma's attorney general against Obamacare on the same issue.</p> \n<p>Furthermore, many of the states defaulting to federal exchanges are the same states that didn't expand Medicaid. They haven't flinched at the prospect of denying health insurance to some of their poorest residents — coverage that is fully financed by the federal government for Obamacare's first three years. Why should we expect the exchanges to be any different?</p>"

My colleagues Libby Nelson and Brandon Ambrosino have put together collections of the magazine's best <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/7/21/5922727/12-new-yorker-education-articles-to-read-while-the-archives-are-free"">education </a>and<a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/7/23/5926393/10-new-yorker-religion-articles-to-read-while-the-archives-are-free""> religion</a> writing, and I am shamelessly cribbing their idea for the health care beat. If there are ones you think should be on this list but are missing, feel free to drop me a note at sarah@vox.com.</p> \n<h3>The best articles by Atul Gawande</h3> \n<p><img src=""http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/assets/4801542/127839005.jpg"" class=""photo"" alt=""127839005""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Atul Gawande (Neilson Barnard / Getty Images Entertainment)</p> \n<p>When I asked my Twitter followers for help putting together this list, I'd say about 90 percent of the suggested articles I got back were by Atul Gawande, the New Yorker's resident surgeon-turned-brilliant-writer. Yes, you may have read some of his stories already. No, that doesn't preclude reading them a second time.</p> \n<h4>\n<a href=""http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2009/06/01/the-cost-conundrum?currentPage=all"">Cost Conundrum</a> | Atul Gawande, June 2009</h4> \n<p>This is arguably Gawande's most famous New Yorker article, which may have something to do with the fact that President Obama <a href=""http://www.cbsnews.com/news/texas-town-at-center-of-healthcare-debate/"">cited it </a>numerous times during the national health reform debate. The Cost Conundrum is the story about McAllen, Tex., which spends $15,000 per Medicare beneficiary - twice the national average - and doesn't have great health outcomes to show for it. It is one of the clearest looks you can get at the wild variation in health care prices in the United States.</p> \n<h4>\n<a href=""http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2008/06/30/the-itch?currentPage=all"">The Itch</a> | Atul Gawande, June 2008</h4> \n<p>""The Itch"" is a story about the totally bizarre, inexplicable science of why we get itches. It starts with one of the best leads I've ever read in a magazine article, which is nearly impossible to read without clutching your scalp in sympathy for the main subject (seriously, try it). What I love about this story is how evocative the writing is, and how it delves so deeply into such a basic, scientific phenomena that we can't fully explain.</p> \n<h4>\n<a href=""http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2010/08/02/letting-go-2?currentPage=all"">Letting Go</a> | Atul Gawande, August 2010</h4> \n<p>This is a great look at end-of-life care in the United States, especially the disconnect between how people want their lives to end - and what type of care they receive. ""Surveys of patients with terminal illness find that their top priorities include, in addition to avoiding suffering, being with family, having the touch of others, being mentally aware, and not becoming a burden to others,"" Gawande writes in the story. ""Our system of technological medical care has utterly failed to meet these needs, and the cost of this failure is measured in far more than dollars.""</p> \n<p>If you want to read even more Gawande articles, I also like <a href=""http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/08/13/big-med?currentPage=all"">Big Med</a> (which could be subtitled ""what hospitals could learn from the Cheesecake Factory"") and the <a href=""http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2007/12/10/the-checklist?currentPage=all"">Checklist</a>.</p> \n<h3>Best stories on health policy interventions</h3> \n<p><img src=""http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/assets/4801550/141972025.jpg"" class=""photo"" alt=""141972025""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">(John Moore / Getty News Images)</p> \n<h4>\n<a href=""http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2011/03/21/the-poverty-clinic"">The Poverty Clinic</a> | Paul Tough, March 2011</h4> \n<p>Tough's story explores a growing body of research showing a chemical connection between early childhood trauma and poor adult health outcomes. This suggests a markedly different way to think about how best to provide medical care to those with traumatic childhood experiences. ""Many of the problems that we think of as social issues-and therefore the province of economists and sociologists,"" Tough writes of the views of the researchers he profiles, ""might better be addressed on the molecular level, among neurons and cytokines and interleukins.""</p> \n<h4>\n<a href=""http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2011/01/24/the-hot-spotters?currentPage=all"" style=""line-height: 1.5;"">The Hotspotters</a>| Atul Gawande, January 2011</h4> \n<p>Yes, I snuck another Gawande article in here. It was bound to happen, mostly because the Hotspotters captures so clearly one of the most promising ways to control health care costs: focusing treatments on the small handful of really sick patients who have sky-high medical bills. Gawande here focused on efforts in Camden, N.J. to control high-spending patients' care, trying to use intensive, preventive measures to keep them out of the emergency room.</p> \n<h4>\n<a href=""http://newamerica.net/node/8122"">Swamp Nurse</a>| Katherine Boo, February 2006</h4> \n<p>It's no secret that Boo is an insanely talented writer, and I love that she brings her talents to this piece, about the Louisiana Medicaid program's attempts to improve childhood outcomes by sending nurses out to care for some of the most difficult-to-reach mothers and their babies. In a way, the key question here is similar to Hotspotters: can intense health care interventions improve the lives of some of society's most vulnerable patients?</p> \n<h3>The best articles on medicine</h3> \n<p><img src=""http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/assets/4801558/494580947.jpg"" class=""photo"" alt=""494580947""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">(Media for Medical)</p> \n<h4>\n<a href=""http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2008/08/11/superbugs?currentPage=all"">Superbugs</a> | Jerome Groopman, August 2008</h4> \n<p>""They are sort of the doomsday-scenario bugs,"" one researcher tells Groopman of the new, antibiotic-resistant bacteria at the heart of this story. ""Superbugs"" is a great exploration of a truly terrifying problem in medicine: bacteria that have grown resistant to all our antibiotics, and that we thus cannot cure. It's hard not to come away from this article pretty terrified of entering a hospital ever again.</p> \n<h4>\n<a href=""http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2011/05/30/god-knows-where-i-am"">God Knows Where I Am</a> | Rachel Aviv, May 2011</h4> \n<p>Aviv's writing on mental health is masterful and, if that's a topic you're interested in, I would highly suggest reading through her other work, like this piece on <a href=""http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/05/05/prescription-for-disaster"">painkiller addiction</a> (I also loved her <a href=""http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/02/10/a-valuable-reputation?currentPage=all"">profile of Tyrone Haye</a>s, albeit not much about health care at all).</p> \n<p>This particular story is one about psychosis, and how modern medicine ought to best handle a situation where a patient rejects her own diagnosis - whether that's a symptom of disease, and should be treated as such, or a genuine refusal. ""Psychiatry is stuck in a kind of moral impasse,"" Aviv writes. ""It is the only field in which refusal of treatment is commonly viewed as a manifestation of illness rather than as an authentic wish.""</p> \n<h4>\n<a href=""http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2008/01/07/guinea-pigging?currentPage=all"">Guinea Pigging</a> | Carl Elliott, January 2008</h4> \n<p>Did you know there is a small cohort of Americans who jump from one pharmaceutical trial to another to make a living? Well, now you do - and I'm pretty sure Elliot has written the best article ever about them.  ""It was like a hotel,"" one so-called professional guinea pig told Elliot of his experience. ""Except that twice they came in and stuck a tube down my nose.""</p> \n<h4>\n<a href=""http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2010/01/25/the-iceman"" style=""line-height: 1.5;"">The Iceman</a>| Jill Lepore, January 2010</h4> \n<p>If Atul Gawande wrote the definitive New Yorker article on how best to handle end-of-life care, then its Jill Lepore who wrote the greatest take on how never to die at all. Her profile of the cryogenics community, and their plans to live forever, is a fantastic read. It also has one of my favorite bits of dialogue in any magazine story, about how one cryogenics companies stores its frozen human beings:</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>I stared at the giant freezers. ""Are they upside down?"" Better for the brain on thawing, I guess. I pictured hibernating bats.</p> \n<p>""Well, not the first ones,"" Ettinger explained. ""We put them in horizontally. Everyone else-in the cylinders-is upside down.""</p> \n<p>""And, in . . . cannisters or something, within the cylinders?""</p> \n<p>""No."" He shook his head. ""In sleeping bags.""</p> \n<p>""Just regular sleeping bags? Like, from Kmart?""</p> \n<p>""No,"" Andy said. ""Wal-Mart.""</p> \n</blockquote>"
What Obamacare's latest challengers are getting wrong,http://www.vox.com/2014/7/24/5931067/what-obamacares-latest-challengers-are-getting-wrong,"Yes, words have meaning. Context has meaning, too.","<p><span>On Tuesday, two federal appeals courts handed down </span><a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/7/22/5926389/halbig-the-court-case-that-could-undo-obamacare"">contradictory rulings</a><span> on whether Obamacare's subsidies are legal in the 36 states that have federally-run exchanges. </span></p> \n<p><span><i>Halbig v. Burwell</i>, which came out of the D.C. Circuit, has commanded the lion's share of attention because its three-judge panel ruled against the government, decreeing subsidies </span><a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/7/22/5821600/obamacare-halbig-subsidies-illegal-most-states"">illegal in most states</a><span>. Several hours later, the Fourth Circuit released an opinion in <i>King v. Burwell</i>, another lawsuit on the same issue. The latter court </span><span>unanimously </span><a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/7/22/5926757/separate-circuit-court-rules-in-favor-of-obamacare-subsidies"" style=""line-height: 1.5; background-color: #ffffff;"">upheld</a><span> the subsidies.</span></p> \n<p>I spoke with Nicholas Bagley, a law professor at the University of Michigan, about the cases. Prior to teaching, he was an attorney on the Appellate Staff in the Civil Division at the U.S. Department of Justice and served as a law clerk to Justice John Paul Stevens at the U.S. Supreme Court and to Judge David Tatel of the D.C. Circuit.</p> \n<p>Bagley has closely tracked these lawsuits, offering <span>analysis and </span><span>commentary at </span><a style=""line-height: 1.5; background-color: #ffffff;"" href=""http://theincidentaleconomist.com/author/nbagley/"">The Incidental Economist</a><span>. We chatted about some points that are hotly disputed in media coverage of the cases. </span></p> \n<p><span>What follows is a transcript of our conversation, edited for length and clarity. </span></p> \n<p><b>Adrianna McIntyre:  There's been a lot of back-and-forth about what Congress ""really"" intended when they passed the Affordable Care Act. Some challengers have argued quite confidently that Congress meant to withhold subsidies on federal exchanges, even though nobody has come forward to corroborate that narrative. What's your take on the challengers' conception of intent? </b></p> \n<p>Nicholas Bagley: When the challengers talk about ""Congressional intent,"" they really talk in two different registers. In one register you have the Michael Cannons of the world, who seem to genuinely believe that Congress intended to deprive tax credits to people with federally-established exchanges. Almost no one else adheres to that view. People who were around during the debate over the ACA don't recall anyone mentioning any such threat and there's no such threat that's manifest on the face of the statute. The notion that Congress intended to level this threat is fictional.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""right"">""THE NOTION THAT CONGRESS INTENDED TO LEVEL THIS THREAT IS FICTIONAL."" </q></p> \n<p>There's another register in which challengers sometimes speak, and that's to say, ""Look, it's really hard to say what Congress really meant. We can't just poll members of Congress. We're better off just looking to the text instead of speculating."" For those challengers, once you figure out what the text of the statute means, the only question that remains is whether assigning that meaning to the statute would generate some kind of absurd result. If not, then you apply the statute as written, even if you might harbor doubts about whether Congress really truly meant it.</p> \n<p>Here, I take the less extreme position from challengers to be that a reasonable Congress could have crafted a statute that deprived people on federal exchanges of tax credits. For them, that should be the end of the story, no matter what Congress ""really"" meant.</p> \n<p><b>AM: Tuesday's rulings spawned a firestorm of media coverage. What do you think has been the biggest mistake so far in the way people are writing about the lawsuits?</b></p> \n<p>NB: In some circles, this case is being framed as a clash between people who adhere to the text of statutes and people who disregard the text of statutes whenever they believe it contradicts some Congressional purpose. I think that dichotomy is false.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""center"">""BOTH COURTS CARE ABOUT THE RULE OF LAW, THEY JUST GO ABOUT figuring out what the law is in different ways."" </q></p> \n<p>Both the D.C. Circuit and the Fourth Circuit were trying to figure out the meaning of the text that Congress enacted — but they went about doing so quite differently. The D.C. Circuit adopted a cramped technique where it adhered to the literal meaning of snippets of the statute taken more or less in isolation. The Fourth Circuit tried to construe  those isolated snippets in light of the broader context of the statute as a whole.</p> \n<p>But it's not that the Fourth Circuit doesn't care about the rule of law and the D.C. Circuit does — that's just ridiculous. Both care about the law, but they go about figuring out what it is in quite different ways.</p> \n<p><span><b>AM: I want to pose a question that has been one of the most controversial so far, at least in media coverage of the lawsuit: Was this a drafting error?</b></span></p> \n<p>NB: The language of the statute is unfortunate and certainly sloppy. Whether it was an ""error"" is, in some sense, not the urgent question here. The urgent question is how we make sense of the words that Congress used when it enacted the statute. And we have to make sense of those words whether it was an error or not.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""right"">""we have to make sense of those words whether it was an error or not.""</q></p> \n<p>So, here, Congress used the phrase ""established by the State under 1311."" In the context of a statute where states had primary responsibility for establishing exchanges and the federal government would be a fallback, do we construe that language to indicate an intent of Congress to threaten the states that chose not to set up their own exchanges with the loss of tax credits? Read in context, there's just no evidence that Congress meant to issue any such threat. In fact, there's a lot of evidence that Congress meant by the words it selected something quite different.</p> \n<p><b>AM: Setting aside for a moment that it's not the pertinent question, are there reasons the government might hesitate to frame this as some kind of mistake?</b></p> \n<p>NB: There are judicial doctrines that allow courts to correct obvious errors in statutory text — the omission of an obvious word, for example, or an incorrect cross-reference where it's obvious what the cross-reference was supposed to be. But the courts are pretty reluctant to correct mistakes unless the mistakes are manifestly clear. Here, we don't have what they call a ""scrivener's error."" This isn't the transposition of two words on accident or just a slip of the pen.</p> \n<p>From the government's perspective, arguing that the statutory text is a mistake exposes them to the rejoinder that mistake or not, it needs to be applied as written. What the government needs to say instead is that the text as written does not mean what the challengers think it means, and that it in fact means something quite different.</p> \n<p>That's why the case is framed not in terms of whether it was a ""mistake,<span>"" but in terms of how we best make sense of the words that Congress selected.</span></p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""center"">""Arguing that the statutory text is a mistake exposes them to the rejoinder that mistake or not, it needs to be applied as written."" </q></p> \n<p>I think if pressed, the government would concede that it's unfortunate language — that it is not the best articulation of what Congress meant. But it's perfectly acceptable to say that the literal meaning of a snippet of legislative text can accrue a different meaning when read in context.</p> \n<p><b>AM: Some people have tried to draw parallels between the exchanges and Medicaid, arguing that since Medicaid expansion conditioned program funding on expansion — at least until the Supreme Court </b><a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/medicaid-expansion-explained/what-did-the-supreme-court-rule-about-obamacares-medicaid-expansion"">made expansion voluntary</a><b> — it's perfectly plausible to say that tax credits were conditioned on states establishing their own exchanges. What's your take on that?</b></p> \n<p>NB: Under the Medicaid statute, the baseline rule is — and has always been — that if you want to participate in Medicaid, you have to play by Medicaid's rules. If Medicaid thinks you're not playing by their rules, the program has always been able to cut off your funding. Medicaid doesn't have to approve a state Medicaid plan.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""right"">""congress wouldn't have pussyfooted around the threat.""</q></p> \n<p>The context of the Affordable Care Act is quite different. This was a brand new scheme of state exchanges with a federal backdrop. There was no convention about who got tax credits on which exchange under what circumstances — Congress was crafting these out of whole cloth. If Congress really meant to make tax credits available only on state-established exchanges, you would expect that intent to be clear on the face of the statute.</p> \n<p>In other words, Congress wouldn't have pussyfooted around the threat to withhold subsidies from federal exchanges. It would have made the threat known, and in a manner that the states could understand. But in fact the states did not see any threat in the ACA — because there wasn't any such threat. In the Medicaid context, they emphatically understood the threat. That's the difference.</p> \n<p><b>AM: What do you make of the D.C. Circuit's use of other examples of ""bad policy"" within the Affordable Care Act — the </b><a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/7/23/5929865/guam-halbig-and-obamacare-disasters"">problems in Guam</a><b> and the U.S. territories, for example — to suggest that this might just be another example of Congress not thinking through the consequences of their legislation? </b></p> \n<p>Well, it's very strange to point to a portion of the law that's not working, and say that because it doesn't work well, other portions of the law might not work well, so we're relieved of any responsibility to interpret the statute in a manner that could make it work well.</p> \n<p>I would have thought that the best approach would be to try to make the statute work as well as possible given the constraints of the statutory text, and not to spike the legislation out of a misplaced fidelity to a piece of legislative text shorn of context.</p> \n<p><b>AM:  What's your sense of what happens if the Halbig ruling does end up as the law of the land?</b></p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""right"">""REPORTS OF THE IMMINENT DEMISE OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT HAVE BEEN OVERSTATED."" </q></p> \n<p>NB: I think there's been too much doom-and-gloom in the media. There's this instinctive reaction that the Affordable Care Act may itself be unraveling, and I think there's very little reason to believe that's likely to happen.</p> \n<p>Even if the litigation is ultimately successful at the Supreme Court — and it's a long road between now and Supreme Court review — we have experience with a Supreme Court ruling that leads to differential outcomes on a state-by-state level. When the Supreme Court issued its decision upholding the ACA, it allowed states to choose whether to opt into the Medicaid expansion. The fact that the ACA operated differently across the states wasn't reason enough to discard the whole statute. And I suspect we would see similar patterns develop here: that there would be participating states and non-participating states. I think the number of participating states would go up as state legislatures and the state governors realize that so many of their taxpayers — many of whom will have grown accustomed to the tax credits to purchase their tax plans — clamor for states to set up their own exchanges.</p> \n<p><!--[if gte mso 9]><xml> </xml><![endif]--> <!--[if gte mso 9]><xml> Normal   0               false   false   false      EN-US   JA   X-NONE </xml><![endif]--><!--[if gte mso 9]><xml> </xml><![endif]--> <!--[if gte mso 10]> \n<style> \n /* Style Definitions */ \ntable.MsoNormalTable \n\t{mso-style-name:""Table Normal""; \n\tmso-tstyle-rowband-size:0; \n\tmso-tstyle-colband-size:0; \n\tmso-style-noshow:yes; \n\tmso-style-priority:99; \n\tmso-style-parent:""""; \n\tmso-padding-alt:0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt; \n\tmso-para-margin-top:0in; \n\tmso-para-margin-right:0in; \n\tmso-para-margin-bottom:8.0pt; \n\tmso-para-margin-left:1.5in; \n\tline-height:120%; \n\tmso-pagination:widow-orphan; \n\tfont-size:10.0pt; \n\tfont-family:Georgia; \n\tmso-ascii-font-family:Georgia; \n\tmso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin; \n\tmso-hansi-font-family:Georgia; \n\tmso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin;} \n</style> \n<![endif]--></p> \n<p>Reports of the imminent demise of the Affordable Care Act have been overstated.</p>"
Still confused about the latest Obamacare lawsuits?

""Until the law expressly provides a 'go' sign, we can in no way ascertain the intent of the framers of the sign. Surely the people honking behind me appreciate the rigor of my judicial acumen.""</p> \n<p>Stewart is correct when he says that the opinions in the two courts split cleanly across partisan lines. In the D.C. Circuit, two Republican-appointed judges ruled that subsidies are illegal, and the lone Democrat-appointed judge on that panel dissented from the decision. The Fourth Circuit <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/7/22/5926757/separate-circuit-court-rules-in-favor-of-obamacare-subsidies"">upheld</a> subsidies, and — not coincidentally — all three judges on that panel were appointed by Democrats.</p> \n<p>But the rulings aren't about partisan hackery, they're about the fact that judges with different ideologies approach the law differently. The conservative judges are inclined to analyze the statute very literally — though many experts <a href=""http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2014/07/dc-circuit-got-wrong-about-obamacare-109263.html#.U9D--IBdV1Z"">believe</a> that they're <a href=""http://theincidentaleconomist.com/wordpress/halbig-said-it-was-applying-the-law-as-written-dont-believe-it/"">taking that literalism too far</a> in this case, setting the law <a href=""http://balkin.blogspot.com/2012/11/a-rejoinder-to-michael-cannon-re.html"">at war with itself</a>. The liberal judges are inclined to believe that the context creates ambiguity, and that ambiguity is best left to be resolved by the agency actually implementing the law.</p>"
The business model for antibiotics is broken. Here's how the White House could fix it,http://www.vox.com/2014/7/27/5936441/the-business-model-for-antibiotics-is-broken-here-are-three,The Obama administration made a long-awaited announcement about steps it would be taking to tackle drug resistance.,"<p><span>It's one of the biggest threats to modern medicine, and it's happening right now in every corner of the world: Antibiotic resistance, when bacteria evolve so that the drugs we have don't respond anymore.</span></p> \n<p>Today, the Obama administration made a long-awaited <a href=""http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2014/09/18/new-executive-actions-combat-antibiotic-resistance-and-protect-public-health"">announcement</a> about steps it would be taking to tackle drug resistance, following similarly urgent calls from other <a href=""http://www.bbc.com/news/health-28098838"">national governments</a> earlier this year.<br><br>The reason the world is taking action is simple:  antibiotic-resistant infections are a vexing problem, associated with  23,000 deaths and two million illnesses just in the US every year. Drug-resistant gonorrhea  is a reality everywhere  from Canada to South Africa; popular antibacterials for urinary tract  infections have been rendered useless in many parts of the world; and  some <a href=""http://www.wired.com/2013/11/end-abx/"">foretell</a> a not too distant future in which we'll<span> lose the ability to treat diseases like cancer and meet the demands of our antibiotic-dependent food supply. </span>The  White House put the health-care costs of resistant infections  at $20-billion.</p> \n<p>The government's announcement involved an executive order by Obama to create a task force who will come up with a plan by February 2015 to combat drug resistance over the next five years.  He also called for more robust surveillance of antibiotic resistant diseases and new regulations to tackle the over-use of antibiotics in hospitals and on farms.</p> \n<p>The announcement also came with one immediate action item: the launch of a $20-million prize for the creation of a new rapid, point-of-care diagnostic test. <br><br>Taken together, this package signals a shift in thinking: while researchers have been shrieking  about this dire public-health scourge for decades, policymakers are  finally moving to tackle it. As Eric Lander, co-chairman of the  President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST), put  it: ""This represents a major elevation of the issue-a major upgrading of  the administration's efforts to help address it.""</p> \n<h3>The drug pipeline is dry</h3> \n<p><br>One of the scariest features of the crisis of antibiotic-resistance is that barely anybody is creating new drugs to address it.

Here are four ideas researchers are experimenting with, which were highlighted in today's package of recommendations. These could become powerful tools in the fight against antibiotic resistance. </span></p> \n<h3><span>1) The anti-antibiotic</span></h3> \n<p>Along with today's announcement from the White House came a <a href=""http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/microsites/ostp/PCAST/pcast_carb_report_sept2014.pdf"">report</a> from PCAST with recommendations about what needs to be done to address this crisis. One necessary focus area, the report read, is ""increasing the longevity of current antibiotics by improving the appropriate use of existing antibiotics."" In other words, one of the best ways to resolve the antibiotic problem is to wean the world off of the drugs.<br><br>To do this, some people are already coming up with antibiotic alternatives.<span> Take George Kenney, an MIT engineer and entrepreneur. He was concerned about the exuberant </span><a style=""line-height: 1.5; background-color: #ffffff;"" href=""http://journals.lww.com/pidj/Abstract/1997/02000/Antimicrobial_prescribing_for_acute_purulent.4.aspx"">overprescribing</a><span> of antibiotics to treat ear infections in children, which studies have  shown has no benefit in pain reduction compared to watchful waiting and  many harms. </span><span>""The solution to antibiotic resistance isn't more and better antibiotics. The solution is less antibiotics,"" Kenney said. ""</span><span>I  wanted to come up with a new solution that avoids antibiotics."" So he  went back 250 years into the annals of medicine to tackle the antibiotic  challenge.</span></p> \n<p><img alt=""Etoscope"" class=""photo"" src=""http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/assets/4810834/etoscope.jpg""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Kenney's Etoscope courtesy of EntraTympanic</p> \n<p>Two years ago, he began working with a team of doctors and  entrepreneurs from MIT, Harvard and Children's Hospital in Boston to  update a technique which physicians in Europe were using in the late  1700s. Back then, long before the first antibiotic was discovered,  doctors would prick a hole into a wee one's ear using a scalpel. The  reason? The tiny puncture would drain fluid that had built up to create  excruciating pain and pressure in the middle ear.</p> \n<p>The <a href=""http://entratympanic.com/The_EToscope_2.html"" style=""font-size: 15.555556297302246px; line-height: 1.5; background-color: #ffffff;"">Etoscope</a>,  Kenney's device, automates that procedure. If it makes it through  clinical trials, it would allow physicians to do what their 18th-century  counterparts did, except with the technology to ensure doctor's have  enough depth perception to avoid harming the inner ear.</p> \n<p>At the hospital level, super-cleaning robots are another ripe area  for development. ""Even after the best humans clean the room, they still  find C.difficile spores hiding on the ceilings or around the room,"" said<span> </span><a href=""http://www.bu.edu/law/faculty/profiles/bios/full-time/outterson_k.html"" style=""background-color: #ffffff;"">Kevin Outterson</a><span>, a health law professor and antibiotics expert at Boston University. ""</span><span>If  you have a problem with multi-drug resistance in the hospital, one idea  is get more antibiotics. Another is to get a super-cleaning robot.""</span></p> \n<p><q class=""center"">""If you have a problem with  multi-drug resistance in the hospital, one idea is get more antibiotics.  Another is to get a super-cleaning robot.""</q></p> \n<p>The robots use <a href=""http://blogs.nebraskamed.com/blog/2013/07/killing-super-bugs-with-a-robot/"">ultraviolet light</a> to kill off potentially harmful bacteria that cleaning staff may miss. Since <a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/washington/%7EcdcatWork/pdf/infections.pdf"">five percent</a> of US hospital patients acquire infections during their stays on the  ward every year, these automated super-cleaners could theoretically help  avoid some of those infections and the need for more drugs to treat  them, though their <a href=""http://www.cbsnews.com/news/hospitals-turn-to-cleaning-robots-to-fight-superbugs/"">impact</a> remains to be seen.</p> \n<h3><span>2) Better diagnostics</span></h3> \n<p>Another way to stave off unnecessary prescribing: better diagnosis.  Big prizes are being awarded around the world for anyone who can invent  better tools to diagnose disease at the point of care. The idea here is  that if we could do a better job of figuring out what illness is being  presented in the doctor's office, we'd prescribe fewer unnecessary  antibiotics.</p> \n<p>Today, the White House announced the launch of one such prize:  $20-million for whoever comes up with a new rapid, point-of-care  diagnostic test. This follows the announcement of the UK's <a href=""http://www.longitudeprize.org/"">Longitude Prize</a> of £10 million to whoever comes up with a plan to address ""one  of the greatest issues of our time."" The prize panel in the UK is also looking for ""cheap, accurate, rapid and easy-to-use point of care test  kit for bacterial infections.""<br><br>In a similar spirit, Médecins Sans Frontières launched the ""<a href=""http://www.who.int/phi/implementation/9.pdf"">open source fever project</a>.""  The winner here will be any inventor of a diagnostic tool that can tell  the difference between fever and sepsis. Sepsis, a bacterial infection  that can lead to death, requires antibiotics; a fever caused by a virus  would not. The tools that come out of these prizes might be able to tell  the difference.</p> \n<h3>3) Delinking the Big Pharma model</h3> \n<p>For years, the idea of ""delinking"" the pharmaceutical business model has been <a href=""http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2013/05/how-drug-companies-keep-medicine-out-of-reach/275853/?single_page=true"">floated </a>around in academic and health circles, and it's only now gaining mainstream notoriety and political heft. Today's PCAST report suggested delinking is one of the key alternative  economic models for drug development. (The concept has also gotten<span> a </span><a href=""http://theincidentaleconomist.com/wordpress/obamas-report-on-antibiotics/"" style=""line-height: 1.5; background-color: #ffffff;"">nod</a><span> </span><span>from </span><span>the World Health Organization and </span><span>Big Pharma companies like </span><a href=""http://theincidentaleconomist.com/wordpress/delinkage/"" style=""line-height: 1.5; background-color: #ffffff;"">GlaxoSmithKline</a><span></span><span>.)</span><span> </span><span></span></p> \n<p><span>The idea here is that traditional research and development models link the volume of patent-protected sales to the return on investment for companies. While drug companies still have their patent, they must sell as many drugs as they can—even if it's potentially dangerous for public health in the case of antibiotics. If manufacturers won't have a big market, as is the case for antibiotics, the drugs that need to be invented will never see the light of day. </span></p> \n<p><img alt=""151050551"" class=""photo"" src=""http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/assets/4810858/151050551.jpg""></p> \n<p style=""text-align: start;"" class=""caption"">MRSA, a staph bacteria that is resistant to certain antibiotics by Universal Images Group</p> \n<p><span>""The problem now is that we need new antibiotics but we don't want to use them as first-line treatments. We want them as second-, third- or fourth-line treatments,"" explained John-Arne </span>Røttingen<span>, </span><span>chair of the advisory panel for the WHO's Consultative Expert Working Group on Research and Development</span><span>. ""We </span><span>should avoid incentivizing innovators and producers of a drug to sell high volumes, and promote overuse and misuse.""</span></p> \n<p>""Delinkage removes the connection between funding and sales volumes,"" said <a href=""http://www.keionline.org/prizes"" style=""text-align: inherit; font-size: 15.454545021057129px; line-height: 1.5; background-color: #ffffff;"">Jamie Love</a><span>, one of the leading proponents of the model and director of the NGO Knowledge Ecology International. Companies would instead be compensated for their antibiotic development on some other basis, such as grants or innovation prizes. Then, when drugs hit the market, part of the deal is that government or another health body such as a hospital would regulate how they're prescribed so that they're only used when they're really needed.</span></p> \n<p>""You have a system where the patent-based incentive system is not working anymore,"" said Dr. Røttingen. ""The innovator company wants a high-volume of sales. Society and public health needs a low volume of sales. That's why more and more, we're seeing an emerging consensus that you want to look into delinking.""</p> \n<h3>4) An antibiotic user fee<br>\n</h3> \n<p>One way to generate money for drug development and deter over-use is to charge a usage fee for the drugs. ""With sales of antibiotics in human health and agriculture estimated at $12 billion per year, a user fee of five percent, for example,"" the PCAST report reads, ""would generate $600 million that could be devoted to incentivize the development of new antibiotics.""<br><br>Of course, the PCAST also called for a lot more than just user fees. Said Kevin Outterson, ""They called for a dramatic increase in federal funding to prevent an antibiotic apocalypse, an additional $1.25 billion per year."" This includes doubling federal spending on antibiotic resistance research, surveillance and spending. Pouring federal funding into antibiotic-resistance isn't an alternative business model of course, but, as Outterson said, ""Given the costs and risks, this is money exceedingly well spent.""</p>"
Congress had lots of Obamacare fights. Ending some subsidies wasn't one of them.,http://www.vox.com/2014/7/26/5937593/obamacare-halbig-gruber-tax-credits,What I learned in covering Obamacare for five years:  Congress meant for residents of all 50 states to have access to financial help.,"<p><span>A large press corps covered the </span><a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/obamacare/what-is-obamacare"">health reform</a><span> debate from its start in 2009. I was, and am, still part of it. We covered the ins and outs of the legislative debate. And much of that debate was about how the </span><a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/obamacare/what-is-a-health-insurance-subsidy"">subsidies</a><span> would work.</span></p> \n<p>""Creating a workable subsidy,"" former Senate aide and current Harvard professor John McDonough <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Inside-National-Health-California-Milbank/dp/0520274520"">writes</a> in his excellent book on the health reform debate, ""was one of the most important and difficult policy challenges in crafting a health reform law.""</p> \n<p>Congress battled over how generous the tax credits ought to be. There was a vicious argument over whether they would cover abortions. But Congress never debated whether they would limit the subsidies to states that built their own exchanges. The subsidies were seen as so fundamental to making the Affordable Care Act work, that, as former Republican staffer Chris Condeluci put it to me, ""we never argued over this particular provision.""</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""center"">""creating a workable subsidy was one of the most important and difficult policy challenges""</q></p> \n<p>It's obvious why. Health-care reform was often described as ""a three-legged stool."" If the government is going to open the individual market to everyone (leg one) and require Americans to purchase coverage (leg two), there have to be subsidies to ensure the mandated insurance was affordable (leg three). Take out any leg of the stool and the whole bill might collapse.</p> \n<p>The three-legged stool metaphor was popularized by <span>Jonathan Gruber, an MIT economist who was the architect of the Massachusetts reforms that Obamacare largely copied, and an advisor both to the White House and congressional Democrats while the Affordable Care Act was being crafted. But recently,</span><a style=""line-height: 1.5; background-color: #ffffff;"" href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/7/25/5936727/it-was-just-a-mistake-obamacare-architect-speaks-on-his-2012-remarks""> two remarks </a><span>he made in January 2012 garnering lots of attention. In both (one more clearly than the other) Gruber suggests that the Affordable Care Act only intended to deliver subsidies in states that set up their own health insurance exchanges.</span></p> \n<p>""I think what's important to remember politically about this, is if you're a state and you don't set up an Exchange, that means your citizens don't get their tax credits,"" Gruber said in one video clip.</p> \n<p><img alt=""4460769992_83aa0f183e_o"" class=""photo"" src=""http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/assets/4815304/4460769992_83aa0f183e_o.jpg""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Obama signs an executive order barring federal tax credits from covering abortions (<a href=""https://flic.kr/p/7NbBvs"" style=""line-height: 1.5;"">The White House</a>)</p> \n<p>This supports the logic in the <i>Halbig v.

Those models always assumed subsidies in all states even as the law's designers knew that some states would have a federal exchange. As Gruber told Cohn:</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>There are few people who worked as closely with Obama administration and Congress as I did, and at no point was it ever even implied that there'd be differential tax credits based on whether the states set up their own exchange. And that was the basis of all the modeling I did, and that was the basis of any sensible analysis of this law that's been done by any expert, left and right. I didn't assume every state would set up its own exchanges but I assumed that subsidies would be available in every state.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>But in the end, what Gruber believed isn't the question in <i>Halbig</i>. The question is what Congress believed.</p> \n<p>After covering the debate over health reform since it began in 2009, I feel completely comfortable saying Congress meant for residents of all 50 states to have access to financial help. It was never a question, during the five years I've spent writing about Obamacare, whether this would be case.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""center"">it was never a question, in the five years i've covered obamacare, whether all states would get help</q></p> \n<p><span>One theory advanced recently is that Congress intended to withhold subsidies from states that didn't build exchanges as a way to force them to build exchanges. This doesn't line up with the reality of the Obamacare debate: Congress was convinced that states would want to build their own exchanges.

That helps explain why two circuit courts came to two disparate rulings on the exact same case this past Tuesday.</p> \n<p>But as someone who has covered Obamacare and the people who wrote it for five years, the argument that Congress actually didn't know how it intended for subsidies to work rings hollow: legislators knew exactly how the subsidies were meant to work, and they intended for them to work in every state, no matter who built the exchange. That idea was at the very core of Obamacare, and no one drafting or voting for the law intended to betray it.</p>"

Reports of Medicare's death have been, as Mark Twain would put it, greatly exaggerated.</p> \n<p>For decades now, the Trustees have published predictions on when Medicare would run out of money if nothing else in the world changed. And in every case, lots of things in the world changed — and Medicare never found itself short on funds. The Congressional Research Service tallied up the old projections in a<a href=""http://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/RS20946.pdf""> 2009 report</a>, which I used to create the table below.</p> \n<p><img src=""http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/assets/4824526/medicare_projections.png"" class=""photo"" alt=""Medicare_projections"" style=""text-align: center; line-height: 1.5;""></p> \n<div style=""text-align:center""> \n<p> </p> \n</div> \n<p>What you'll see here is that this report has predicted, many times in the past, that the Medicare Trust Fund would run out of money.

Health financing isn't static, and Congress has lots of tools in its legislative tool box to ensure Medicare can continue paying seniors' bills. That's what they've done in the past and, given that seniors are pretty big fans of Medicare (as well as pretty big fans of voting), its a decently safe assumption that its what they would do in the future, too.</p> \n<p>Whatever the new insolvency projection released today is, you can rest pretty sure that Medicare won't pack up and stop paying bills that year — or any other time soon.</p>"

In 2013, the the same program spent $266.2 billion to cover 51.9 million people. These figures come from Table II B.1 in the <a href=""http://downloads.cms.gov/files/TR2013.pdf"">2012 </a>and <a href=""http://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/ReportsTrustFunds/Downloads/TR2014.pdf"">2013 </a>reports.</p> \n<p>Medicare's hospital insurance program is gigantic; it spends more money in a given year than the<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._states_by_GDP""> entire state of Wisconsin</a>. In that context, $600 million is not much more than a rounding error. And some senior administration officials I spoke with cautioned against reading too much into these particular figures; receipts for services rendered in 2013, for example, might trickle after the year has ended.</p> \n<p>But what's definitely clear — and what's driving this trend — is that Medicare is spending significantly less per person than they did two years ago. And this report expects that trend to continue for another two years going forward.</p> \n<p><img src=""http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/assets/4826288/medicare_per_person.png"" class=""photo"" alt=""Medicare_per_person""></p> \n<p>By 2015, the Medicare Trustees' Report projects that the program will spend less per person on hospital care than it did in 2008. This doesn't happen much in health care: not just slower growth, but the actual dollar amount spent on a given type of care dropping.</p> \n<p><span>These figures only represent the hospital insurance part of Medicare (this is Medicare Part A). The government insurance program has separate programs for doctor visits (Medicare Part B) and prescription drug coverage (Medicare Part D). </span></p> \n<p>But even when you look at the overall picture, it generally looks pretty good: per-person Medicare spending has grown by an average of 0.8 percent since 2009. That's a lot slower than the rest of the economy, which has grown at an average 3.1 percent rate. Between 2012 and 2013, it was even slower: Medicare's per person costs stayed exactly the same.</p> \n<p>As Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell put it at a press briefing today, ""that is a growth rate of 0 percent.""</p> \n<p><span>As to why this is happening, that's the big question. There has been an overall slowdown in health care spending, some of which is likely due to the recession: when people have less money to spend, they don't buy as many medical services.</span></p> \n<p>But Medicare beneficiaries should be somewhat insulated from the economy. They don't lose insurance coverage during economic downturns, for example, as many who lose their jobs do. Many live on a more fixed income, too.</p> \n<p>Its certainly possible that the overall economic climate might have impacted seniors' decisions about health care. And its possible the health care law, and its changes to the Medicare system (this report estimates there are 165 of them) have had an impact as well.</p> \n<p>The Affordable Care Act, for example, penalizes preventable readmissions — times when seniors turn up at the hospital a second time after something goes wrong during their first visit. Readmissions have been falling pretty steadily for the last few years, and those reductions could be showing up in the lower per-person spending.</p> \n<p><img src=""http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/assets/4416961/readmission_rates.png"" class=""photo"" alt=""Readmission_rates""></p> \n<p>Last, the downward shift in hospital spending could just reflect larger trends in how doctors deliver medicine. As new innovations happen, procedures that used to be more invasive — and require a hospital stay — improve, become easier and shift into an inpatient setting, or can be treated with prescription drugs. You see that change below, with hospital care, since the early 1980s, becoming a slightly smaller portion of the country's overall medical bill. <img src=""http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/assets/4779962/healthcare3.gif"" class=""photo"" alt=""Healthcare3""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">(California Healthcare Foundation)</p> \n<p>Overall, this report suggests a pretty positive trend for Medicare spending — it just doesn't totally explain the forces that are driving it.</p>"
5 reasons we can't predict the future of health costs,http://www.vox.com/2014/7/30/5949763/future-of-health-spending-unknown,We would love to know what the future holds for health spending. Here's why we don't.,"<p><span>It is, without a doubt, one of the most important questions for federal budget policy: how quickly will health spending grow?</span></p> \n<p>Really fast health care spending means more tax dollars going towards Medicare and Medicaid — and less money for everything else. But slow growth, the type the country has seen for <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/7/28/5945197/the-amazing-news-buried-inside-a-283-page-medicare-report"">the last four years</a>, could hugely alleviate spending pressures.</p> \n<p>If the recent slowdown persists, it could change <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/6/15/5807046/orszag-its-time-for-some-optimism-about-health-care-spending"">everything we think we know</a> about the nation's deficit — but whether it will last is also vexingly difficult to figure out.</p> \n<p>How much the country spends of health care is influenced by a variety of factors. At a <a href=""http://altarum.org/research-centers/center-for-sustainable-health-spending/meetings-videos-highlights-and-reports"">symposium hosted by the Altarum Institute</a> earlier this month, Paul Ginsburg, a health economist at the University of Southern California, highlighted some issues he thinks are particularly challenging to predict when it comes to forecasting health spending over the course of a decade.</p> \n<h3>1) What's happening with the overall economy?</h3> \n<p>Part of what determines how quickly health care spending grows is the health of the overall economy. When the economy is doing well, people spend more on health care. Economists quibble over how much the recent recession is behind the latest slowdown, but there's a general consensus that it has played a role.</p> \n<p>""We've had some very encouraging numbers on job creation,"" Ginsburg said at the symposium. ""The question is whether this will lead to faster growth of GDP than we've had, or whether this will falter again.""</p> \n<h3>2) Why has technological change slowed?</h3> \n<p>According to <a href=""http://theincidentaleconomist.com/wordpress/whats-been-driving-the-slowdown-in-health-spending-and-will-it-stick/"">recent research</a> by<span> noted health economists </span><span>Jonathan Skinner, Jonathan Holmes, and Amitabh Chandra</span><span>, the country is adopting newer, expensive technology more slowly than it used to. Spending growth on prescription medications in particular has abated as generic versions become more available and more popular.</span></p> \n<p>It's not entirely clear why there has been a slower rate of technological change overall, or whether that trend will continue. It's possible that today's consumers simply don't want new technologies that don't offer substantial benefits for their costs, which would be a good thing. There might be more demand for technology that actually saves money — another development that would be great for health care. Alternatively, this could be a blip in the research and development cycle. We just don't know.</p> \n<h3>3) Will payment reforms take hold more broadly and be successful?</h3> \n<p>Obamacare has ushered in a wave of changes to how Medicare pays doctors; the new Medicare Trustees' report counts no fewer than <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/7/28/5945197/the-amazing-news-buried-inside-a-283-page-medicare-report"">165 Medicare reform programs</a> in the health overhaul.</p> \n<p>These reforms aim to move the American health care system from one that pays for volume, rewarding doctors for providing lots of services, towards one that pays for value — rewarding doctors for helping patients get healthier.</p> \n<p><q class=""center"" aria-hidden=""true"">""PROVIDER PARTICIPATION IS NOT BECAUSE OF A STRONG BUSINESS CASE, BUT BECAUSE THIS MAY BE THE FUTURE."" </q></p> \n<p>The federal government is limited in the ways it can promote these types of changes to how insurers pay for medical services; they only control the purse for Medicare and Medicaid. So its not clear whether other parts of the health care system will adopt these changes — or if they'll even work in Medicare.</p> \n<p>Still, those payment reforms seem to be diffusing to some private insurers. According to a <a href=""http://www.bcbs.com/healthcare-news/bcbsa/bcbs-companies-direct-more-than-65b-in-medical-spending-to-value-based-care-programs.html"">recent report</a> from Blue Cross and Blue Shield, one out of every five dollars spent by their plans go toward ""value-based"" programs that make doctors accountable for quality, health outcomes, and costs.</p> \n<p>""My sense is that a lot of the provider participation in both Medicare and privately-insured plans is not because there's a strong business case for participation, but because of the possibility that this may be the future,"" Ginsburg told the audience. ""Ultimately, of course, the biggest uncertainty is how well the payment approaches will work.""</p> \n<h3>4) What will happen to out-of-pocket costs over time?</h3> \n<p><q class=""right"" aria-hidden=""true"">cost-sharing has helped hold down spending</q></p> \n<p>Over the last few decades, there has been a shift toward patients paying for more of their own care.  The idea is that when people have higher cost-sharing — higher deductibles and copays — they will make more careful choices about when and how often to seek medical care, which should reduce some unnecessary doctor's visits.</p> \n<p><span>Economists generally agree that a shift toward higher patient cost-sharing has helped hold down spending growth over the last few years. ""High-deductible"" insurance plans, which were rare just a decade ago, now make up one-fifth of all employer-sponsored insurance.</span></p> \n<p>This Kaiser Family Foundation <a href=""http://kff.org/report-section/2013-summary-of-findings/"">chart</a> shows how quickly plans with deductibles of $1,000 or more (for a single person) have grown. That growth has been especially rapid among smaller employers.</p> \n<p><img src=""http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/assets/4832884/kffesideductible.png"" class=""photo"" alt=""Kffesideductible""></p> \n<p>Ginsburg keyed in on the ""<a href=""http://www.healthaffairs.org/healthpolicybriefs/brief.php?brief_id=99"">Cadillac tax</a>"" as the policy on which the future of patient cost-sharing could balance. That part of Obamacare is scheduled to go into effect in 2018, and taxes insurance plans that have premiums exceed a certain annual cost threshold ($10,200 for an individuals). Generally speaking, lower premiums mean higher cost-sharing at point of service.</p> \n<p>""We increasingly hear anecdotes about how the Cadillac tax is leading to changes in plans,"" he said. ""If the Cadillac tax is not sustained, that will turn this around.""</p> \n<h3>5) Will narrow networks survive?</h3> \n<p>Under Obamacare, many insurance plans purchased through the new state exchanges have ""narrow networks"" — a limited menu of doctors and providers that enrollees can choose from when they want medical care. This is an important cost-control tool, because insurers can negotiate lower prices by promising doctors and hospitals a constant flow of patients.</p> \n<p>But if the networks are too small, patients could run into access issues. The government is investigating concerns among patients and patient advocates about whether Obamacare's narrow networks have enough doctors — especially enough doctors in specialized fields — to meet demand. While it's important to ensure timely access to care, there is a worry that new regulation might overcorrect the problem, undermining network innovation as a tool used to reduce spending.</p>"

That works out to 58 percent of the state's uninsured population, which is the largest in the country. They largely did so through the expansion of Medi-Cal, the state's Medicaid program.</p> \n<div style=""text-align:center""><img src=""http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/assets/4834914/california_.png"" class=""photo"" alt=""California_""></div> \n<p>This Kaiser survey underscores the huge stakes of states deciding whether or not to participate in the Medicaid expansion. Forty-four percent of California's newly-insured are signed up for Medi-Cal. That means the Medicaid expansion is covering nearly three times as many people as the state health exchange, Covered California.</p> \n<p><span>One other interesting tidbit from the Kaiser survey: it suggests that an expansion in employer-sponsored insurance is covering more people than the health exchange, too. Twelve percent of the uninsured reported gaining insurance at work, compared to the 9 percent buying on the exchange. </span></p> \n<p>This could show uninsured Californians who previously eschewed their employer's offer of coverage deciding to sign up to comply with Obamacare's individual mandate. It likely also shows the normal churn in health coverage, with uninsured people gaining new jobs with health benefits.</p>"
We have the science to build an Ebola vaccine. So why hasn't it happened?,http://www.vox.com/2014/7/31/5952665/ebola-virus-vaccine-why-hasnt-it-happened,"""The drugs are out there. It's much more of a situation with economic and logistical challenges.""","<p>The <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/7/29/5948415/ebola-outbreak-disease-virus-symptoms-africa-facts-guinea-nigeria"">ongoing Ebola outbreak</a> in West Africa is the deadliest in history, with more than 500 dead and hundreds more infected. The particular virus in this outbreak, known as the <i>Zaire ebolavirus</i>, is the deadliest type of the disease; it has killed <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/7/30/5952783/ebola-virus-outbreak-disease-species-strains/in/5712456"">79 percent</a> of those infected in previous outbreaks.</p> \n<p>This isn't how an Ebola outbreak has to work. Researchers have devoted lots of time to building a vaccine that could stop the disease altogether — and according to Daniel Bausch, a Tulane professor who researches Ebola and other infectious diseases, they're making really significant progress.</p> \n<p>Bausch says that the obstacle to developing an Ebola vaccine isn't the science; researchers have actually made really great strides in figuring out how to fight back against Ebola and the Marburg virus, a similar disease.</p> \n<p>""<span>We now have a couple of different vaccine platforms that have shown to be protective with non-human primates,"" says Bausch, who has received awards for his work containing disease outbreaks in Uganda. He is currently stationed in Lima, Peru, as the director of the emerging infections department of Naval Medical Research Unit 6. </span></p> \n<p>The problem, instead, is the economics of drug development. Pharmaceutical companies have little incentive to pour research and development dollars into curing a disease that surfaces sporadically in low-income, African countries. They aren't likely to see a large pay-off at the end — and could stand to lose money.</p> \n<p>Bausch and I spoke Wednesday afternoon about where things stand with developing an Ebola vaccine, what hurdles remain, and how you test a drug that only shows up in infrequent outbreaks. What follows is a transcript of our conversation, lightly edited for clarity and length.</p> \n<p><b>Sarah Kliff: Can we start with where things are on the science of Ebola vaccines, and how much we know about the best way to prevent the disease?</b></p> \n<p>Daniel Bausch: There have been some significant developments for both vaccines and treatments for Ebola and its sister virus, Marburg virus. We now have a couple of different vaccine platforms that have shown to be protective with non-human primates. The most notable development are<a href=""http://www.cancer.gov/dictionary?cdrid=46066""> monoclonal antibodies</a> that are engineered to bind with the ebola virus. There have been breakthroughs in the past few years and, not only are they protective when given right after exposure, but they also work a few days after the illness starts.</p> \n<p>That's the good news, but we've had a real break in trying to move forward to get these into human trials and get them out there as a real tool we can use for people infected with these viruses.</p> \n<p><b>SK: So what stands between that science and getting these drugs to Ebola patients?</b></p> \n<p>DB: Part of that is economics. These outbreaks affect the poorest communities on the planet. Although they do create incredible upheaval, they are relatively rare events. So if you look at the interest of pharmaceutical companies, there is not huge enthusiasm to take an Ebola drug through phase one, two, and three of a trial and make an Ebola vaccine that maybe a few tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of people will use.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""center"">""the drugs are out there. its much more of a situation with economic and logistical challenges.""</q></p> \n<p>There's not a huge demand for this, but there could be other ways to move forward. There are concerns, for example, about Ebola being used as bioterrorism, and that drives a lot of the funding for this. The Department of Defense might be interested in a vaccine if they thought the disease could be used as a weapon.</p> \n<p>We need to find the mechanism to get to the next step, and get them out there for actual use.</p> \n<p><b>SK: As you mention there are <a href=""http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/ResourcesForYou/Consumers/UCM284393.pdf"">multiple phases of drug testing</a>, starting with phase one tests for safety and then moving into later phases to test if the drug actually works. How far have the Ebola vaccine candidates you mention made it in that process?</b></p> \n<p>DB: There is one vaccine that has gone through phase one testing [where the drug is tested on a small number of humans for safety]. Now the challenge is how do we get into phase two trials, which test efficacy. How do you plan a prospective trial of something that we don't know where it will be seen next, in outbreak form?</p> \n<p>The drugs are out there. It's much more of a situation with economic and logistical challenges.</p> \n<p><b>SK: Where does most the funding for research on the Ebola vaccine come from now?</b></p> \n<p>DB: The research has been almost exclusively through the National Institutes of Health. I think a lot of that has been driven by our country's concern over bioterrorism, and the use of some viruses as weapons. I'm not saying that's not one legitimate reason to do research, but just that its a different driving force.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""center"">""We need to find the mechanism to get to the next step and get [the drugs] out there for actual use""</q></p> \n<p>The way our whole medical-industrial research system works, and this is not unique to Ebola, is the basic research gets done with NIH funding and, after that, research and development happens through private investment. For many different diseases, they get stalled and prevented from going beyond the basic research side, before they can be a real world treatment.</p> \n<p><b>SK: How would you envision an Ebola vaccine working in practice? Is this something you would give to everybody, or try and provide to people at high risk?</b></p> \n<p>DB: There could be a case for limited widespread use, if that doesn't sound too contradictory. <span>I wouldn't anticipate it would be cost-effective or really practical to take the approach of widespread vaccination. It would work more like how we currently handle Yellow Fever: when you have an outbreak, you go in and really rapidly vaccinate the 100,000 or so people who are in the area that is at risk. I would see it more like that, but with an Ebola vaccine. We would go in right away and say, the next day, we have 100,000 doses with our teams and start protecting people. </span></p> \n<p><b>SK: Have any humans ever used any of the Ebola vaccines that aren't yet approved for market? I've seen a bit of chatter about the idea of giving patients experimental treatments, which might be better than nothing.</b></p> \n<p>DB: So far its been more tossed around but not really acted on yet. There is one exception, but it wasn't an outbreak. There was a needle-stick injury in a lab, and that person was able to get a post-exposure Ebola vaccine. The person didn't get sick, but we don't know if the vaccine was what protected him. We can't even be sure the accident infected him. The only conclusion we can make is that, with this sample size of one, is that person did not have severe side effects from taking it.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""left"">ebola vaccines ""do seem to be safe in non-human primates""</q></p> \n<p>Some concern, about using these non-approved drugs, is that we would be giving the impression of experimenting on people. That creates a lot of reticence — if someone is treated and dies — that you could have causality attributed.</p> \n<p>That being said, they do seem to be safe in non-human primates and we don't see adverse effects in the ones that have gone through limited phase-one trials. Most of us in the field, if we were laying in bed with Ebola and asked whether to take it, I think all of us would say, ""Bring it on."" Safety trials be damned; I would want to give it a shot.</p>"
"Maybe there's not a doctor shortage, after all",http://www.vox.com/2014/7/31/5953247/institute-medicine-report-doctor-shortage-gme,"The government spends $16 billion annually on training doctors, and many stakeholders are clamoring for more. Would that be money well-spent?","<p>For years, medical schools<b> </b>have been sounding the alarm that the United States is facing a doctor shortage — that we don't have enough providers for the population we have now, and we certainly won't have enough once Obamacare is in full force.</p> \n<p>But according to a new <a href=""http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=18754"">report</a> by the Institute of Medicine, a non-profit that is hugely influential in the health care world, those fears may be overblown. Their analysis finds ""no credible evidence"" that a doctor shortage actually exists.</p> \n<h3>We may not need more doctors</h3> \n<p>As Obamacare increases the ranks of the insured, there's a fear that the current supply of health providers won't be able to meet demand. The notion that this is a crisis our nation is currently facing has become so well-ingrained in policy discourse that it's almost a given. A common refrain goes something like this: <i>Of course</i> we have too few doctors, and of course health reform is going to make that problem worse; the real debate is over what to do about it.</p> \n<p>The Medicare program has, for decades now, helped fund the vast majority of residency slots in the United States. The Association of American Medical Colleges and its member organizations will often use figures like these to lobby the government to put additional funding towards training doctors, and creating more residency slots.</p> \n<p class=""caption""><img src=""http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/assets/4839816/workforcegraphic2012-data.jpg"" class=""photo"" alt=""Workforcegraphic2012-data"">(<a href=""https://www.aamc.org/advocacy/campaigns_and_coalitions/fixdocshortage/"">Association of American Medical Colleges</a>)</p> \n<p>According to the AAMC, the nation will experience a doctor shortage on the order of <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/20/opinion/sunday/bottlenecks-in-training-doctors.html"">91,000 physicians</a> by 2020 — 45,000 in primary care and 46,000 surgeons and specialists.</p> \n<p>But the IOM argues that the data just doesn't reliably support the claim, that it rests on too many flawed assumptions. According to the report, shortage projections use questionable doctor-patient ratios, don't consider geographic differences in physician supply, and ignore the role of new technology and alternate providers like <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dItVypEXAY"">nurse practitioners</a>.</p> \n<p>Before the government earmarks more money for graduate medical education, the report argues, there needs to be stronger evidence that increasing residency positions and creating more doctors is really a useful way to spend that money.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""center"">""inefficient cars require more gas. inefficient health care systems require more doctors.""</q></p> \n<p>Amitabh Chandra, a Harvard economist, keys in on efficiency issues in the health care system.</p> \n<p>""Maybe it looks like there's a doctor shortage, but that's because the system is inefficient. Inefficient cars require more gas. Inefficient health care systems require more doctors,"" he says. ""The last thing we'd want to do is increase the number of doctors and <i>then</i> reform the system — then we'd have a surplus, which would result in unemployed doctors or doctors providing excessive services to patients.""</p> \n<p>This view isn't shared by everyone. Atul Grover, a physician and spokesman for the AAMC, worries that it's much more difficult to address other problems <span>without additional doctors</span><span>.</span></p> \n<p>""The IOM never comes right out and says there's <i>no </i>doctor shortage, just that there's not sufficient evidence of one,"" Grover said. ""There's no getting around the fact that if you have an aggregate shortage, you're going to have a harder time getting people into rural and other underserved areas.""</p> \n<p>While monetary costs of an oversupply of physicians could be high, risks and consequences of an undersupply are very real, too.</p> \n<h3>Experts agree: we have doctor distribution issues</h3> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""right"">NO SALARY BUMP CAN TURN RURAL idaho INTO BOSTON.</q></p> \n<p>On the geographic distribution issue — that physicians aren't going where they're needed most — there's quite a lot of consensus. Physicians are normal people who are drawn to  attractive places to live, just like everyone else. But it's more than that: doctors who live in wealthy communities are often paid much more handsomely.</p> \n<p>""Right now Medicare pays more to providers who work in more expensive areas — providers who work in Manhattan get more than providers who work in Milwaukee,"" Chandra said. ""Maybe what you want to do is offer additional payments to physicians working in underserved areas.""</p> \n<p>Payment incentives won't be a silver bullet, Grover pointed out. Physicians weigh other factors when deciding where to practice, like prestige and quality of living. No salary bump can turn rural Idaho into Boston, Massachusetts.</p> \n<p>Another ""distribution"" issue has to do with the type of medicine physicians practice: primary care doctors have lower salaries than specialists, and more young doctors have been gravitating toward specialties as a result. This trend toward lucrative specialization means the country is spending more on health care.</p> \n<h3>Should we pay medical schools to convince doctors to go to rural Idaho?</h3> \n<p><span>Hospitals argue that they need funding to subsidize the cost of training new  doctors because that training is expensive. And it is! But those residents are also performing services for patients, generating revenue for hospitals. As a result, they receive modest salaries — and some economists just don't buy the argument that teaching hospitals couldn't get by without the government helping to foot the bill. </span></p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""center"">Residency funding is seen as a policy lever used to chart the future of health care.</q></p> \n<p>""The only reason that residents get paid in this model is because the value of the services they generate for the hospital exceeds the 'tuition' that they have to pay for their training,"" said Chandra. ""It will look to everybody who isn’t trained in public policy like ‘Oh my God, the hospitals, out of pure largesse, pay the residents.’ But it’s no different than the medical student who pays tuition — it’s just in the medical student’s case, they’re not generating anything valuable for the hospital.""</p> \n<p>Furthermore, federal residency funding is seen as a potential policy lever that can be used to chart the future of health care by encouraging medical school graduates to choose residencies in medical fields or geographic locations that are hurting for more physicians.</p> \n<p>Right now, the report charges that the government is funding residencies with blinders on, with little control over how the funding impacts the health care workforce. There are ways to change that: the government could try to use money to make residencies and fellowships in underserved regions and specialties particularly attractive.</p> \n<p>It might also try to reshape the workforce by tipping the balance of residency slots away from specialties, back toward general medicine. Over time — a lot of time — this would change the composition of what medicine our doctors practice and where they practice it.</p> \n<p><span><b></b>But some economists — like Chandra — think that trying to route this funding through teaching hospitals is too oblique an approach to the problem.</span></p> \n<p>""I think the report represents a pretty big compromise, because someone like me would say, ‘Take the $16 billion of federal GME money and use it to pay for something that we know is valuable and that works,'"" Chandra said. ""If you want to use it for GME, then it should be a loan-forgiveness program for doctors who work in underserved areas, or who go into specialties where we need more doctors. I just don't see empirical evidence for why we should be using it for medical education.""</p> \n<h3>The full impact of the report remains to be seen</h3> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""right"">"" 'DOCTOR-MAKERS' ARE INFLUENTIAL IN A WAY TAXPAYERS AND PATIENTS ARE NOT.""</q></p> \n<p>The report also offers a <a style=""text-decoration: underline; outline: #000000;"" href=""http://www.kaiserhealthnews.org/Stories/2014/July/29/panel-recommends-changes-to-doctor-training.aspx#.U9e79aFNRQY.twitter"">sweeping array</a> of recommendations on how graduate medical education,<span> the residency and fellowship training that doctors get immediately following graduate school,</span><span> should be revolutionized to meet today's needs.

The weird scaremongering in the latest Obamacare lawsuit,http://www.vox.com/2014/8/1/5959301/the-weird-scaremongering-in-the-latest-obamacare-lawsuit,Will millions of Americans have to pay back billions in Obamacare subsidies?,"<p>The <a href=""http://cei.org/sites/default/files/King%20Petition%20Final.pdf"">petition</a> filed with the Supreme Court on the Obamacare <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/7/22/5926389/halbig-the-court-case-that-could-undo-obamacare"">subsidies case</a> contains some dire language. ""Profound consequences of delay mean that this Court's definitive resolution is urgently needed,"" reads the headline of one subsection.</p> \n<p>Among those ""profound consequences,"" the plaintiffs write:</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>Every month that subsidies are paid on the authority of the IRS Rule, its millions of beneficiaries thus not only detrimentally rely on its validity to make important economic decisions, but are potentially incurring thousands of dollars of potential debt-owed to the IRS as back taxes. This is grossly unfair, and only prompt resolution of the legal dispute can curtail that unfairness.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>In effect, they argue that this case is charged with urgency because millions of Americans could be responsible for repaying billions of dollars in tax credits that were never authorized.</p> \n<p>That's almost certainly an overstatement. Subsidies will continue to flow while the case is being resolved, and even if the tax credits are eventually invalidated, that doesn't mean that the IRS will claw back the subsidies they issued in the interim.</p> \n<p>""There's a federal statute that has to do with IRS regulations,"" says Timothy Jost, a law professor at Washington and Lee University. ""In the event this case goes against the government in the Supreme Court, the IRS would have to promulgate a new regulation on the tax credits.""</p> \n<p>The statute Jost refers to (<a href=""http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/7805"" style=""background-color: #ffffff;"">26 U.S.C. 7805(b)</a><span> if you want to get hyper-specific) indicates that new regulations would only have prospective, not retroactive, effects. Jost also points out that the Secretary of Treasury — not the high court or anyone else — wields the authority to determine retroactivity of judicial decisions.</span></p> \n<p>Scaremongering that people might have to repay their tax credits in the future, and that this problem gets worse the longer the Court waits, is just that: scaremongering.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""center"">there's a narrow window of opportunity and they need to gin up all the urgency they can to encourage supreme court review. </q></p> \n<p>The plaintiffs did hedge themselves, couching their argument with words like ""may"" and ""potentially."" But they make other claims of urgency, so why are they reaching to make this argument about back taxes at all?</p> \n<p>It may have to do with the fact that right now, there's a narrow window of opportunity, and they need to gin up all the ""urgency"" they can to encourage Supreme Court consideration.</p> \n<p>The two federal appeals courts that ruled earlier this month are split — the <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/7/22/5821600/obamacare-halbig-subsidies-illegal-most-states/in/5690430"">DC Circuit</a> ruled in favor of plaintiffs in Halbig, the <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/7/22/5926757/separate-circuit-court-rules-in-favor-of-obamacare-subsidies/in/5690430"">Fourth Circuit</a> in favor of the government in King.

But people writing on the internet will be damned if they don’t try.</span></p> \n<p>Over the past few weeks, thousands of words have been written on <i>Halbig v. Burwell</i>, the Obamacare lawsuit that argues subsidies are illegal on the 36 federally-run insurance exchanges. Most of those words have been people talking past each other, about what the law's drafters did (or didn't) intend, and how that might matter for a potential Supreme Court hearing.</p> \n<p>As someone who takes this lawsuit seriously and has followed it closely for more than two years, there are some things that I think are just getting lost in the media blitzkrieg — and are worth getting right here.</p> \n<h3>1) Administrative Law 101: The administration doesn't need to prove intent, just ambiguity</h3> \n<p>Lost in the back-and-forth about what Congress did or didn't intend is a key fact: the administration doesn't actually need to prove intent to defeat this Obamacare challenge.</p> \n<p>Sure, the White House is <i>trying</i> to prove intent. Their <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/7/22/5926423/read-the-decision-that-ruled-obamacare-illegal-in-36-states/in/5690430"">primary argument</a> is that a plain-text reading of the law suggests that federal and state exchanges are understood as perfectly equivalent. When Section 1321 of the Affordable Care Act directs the HHS secretary to establish ""such Exchange"" if a state doesn't create their own, ""such Exchange"" is understood to be ""an Exchange established by the State under 1311"".</p> \n<p><q class=""right"" aria-hidden=""true"">the administration doesn't need to prove intent.</q></p> \n<p>But they have a fallback argument, too: If you don't agree with them on the plain-text reading, you should at least believe that the text at issue is ambiguous when read within the context of the entire statute. Under a legal doctrine called Chevron deference, ambiguous statutory language is punted to the agency implementing the law. It's a legal tie, but <a href=""http://theincidentaleconomist.com/wordpress/what-did-congress-mean-by-established-by-the-state/"">the tie goes to the government</a>.</p> \n<h3>2) And the text of the law can be read as ambiguous. Yes, even the words ""established by the State.""</h3> \n<p><span>The plaintiffs make a seductively simple argument: an exchange ""established by the State"" simply cannot be an exchange that was actually set up by the federal government. Those are two different things.</span></p> \n<p>And that’s a good argument, if we can be sure that Congress was very careful in the words that it chose.</p> \n<p><span>For the law to be unambiguous, Congress needs to use language like ""established by the State"" to refer </span><i style=""line-height: 1.5;"">consistently</i><span> to state-established exchanges. If we can identify instances where Congress used ""established by the State"" to refer to exchanges more generally, that signals that Congress wasn’t careful about the words that it chose. It signals ambiguity in the intent conveyed by those words. And ambiguity triggers deference to agency implementing the law.</span></p> \n<p>Let’s say, for the sake of argument, that I agree ""established by the State"" in the tax credit calculation is most naturally read to withhold tax credits from federal exchanges. Does the story end there, in favor of the plaintiffs?</p> \n<p>As it turns out, no.</p> \n<p><q class=""center"" aria-hidden=""true"">""READ LITERALLY, THIS WOULD PROHIBIT ANYONE in states with federal exchanges FROM BUYING insurance on those exchanges. </q></p> \n<p>""The ACA, for example, limits who can buy insurance on an exchange to those who ‘resid[e] in the State that established the Exchange,'"" <a href=""http://theincidentaleconomist.com/wordpress/what-did-congress-mean-by-established-by-the-state/"">writes</a> Nicholas Bagley, a professor of administrative and health law at the University of Michigan. ""Read literally, this would prohibit anyone in states with federal exchanges from buying insurance on those exchanges. Federal exchanges would be useless. That can't be what Congress meant.""</p> \n<p><i>Halbig'</i>s proponents argue that the ""established by the State"" language <i>must </i>matter where the subsidies are concerned because Congress chooses its words carefully. If ""established by the State"" didn't matter, the phrase would be superfluous, and Congress simply doesn't use superfluous language.</p> \n<p>But if the precise words Congress chooses always matter, then the entire section establishing federal exchanges is superfluous. The feds can set the exchanges up, but no one can enroll in them. Either that's true, or Congress sometimes used ""exchange established by the State"" to mean exchanges more generally.</p> \n<p>Now we have a semantic dilemma — precisely the kind of ambiguity that typically triggers Chevron deference.</p> \n<h3>3) Medicaid expansion is a deeply flawed analogy</h3> \n<p>Challengers have repeatedly drawn a parallel between the exchanges and the Medicaid expansion. Under the initial intent of the law — before the Supreme Court made expansion voluntary — states were offered generous sums of money to expand the public program, the hypothetical ""carrot."" The ""stick"" was a big one: if states didn't expand Medicaid, funding was taken away for the entire program, not just the new population.</p> \n<p>So it must make sense that they would do this for state exchanges, too: offer funding to scale them up, withhold funding if they don't.</p> \n<p>This isn't quite right.</p> \n<p>Congress wasn't scheming up something from nothing when it drafted the Medicaid expansion. Periodically during the program's 49-year history, they have tweaked the definition of ""Medicaid-eligible"" — mandating coverage of more children here, higher income limits for pregnant women there. States have had to accept these new eligibility definitions as part and parcel of the program. That's how Obamacare was going to work, just on a much bigger scale.</p> \n<p><q class=""right"" aria-hidden=""true"">state exchanges were always a new — and optional — program.</q></p> \n<p>The legal logic behind the Supreme Court's decision to make Medicaid ""optional"" was not a straightforward judgment that expansion was ""coercive"" — though the Chief Justice did seem to believe that — but that Medicaid expansion was a fundamentally <a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/medicaid-expansion-explained/what-did-the-supreme-court-rule-about-obamacares-medicaid-expansion""><i>new and different program</i></a>. It introduced new populations and a new financing scheme. It was Medicaid 2.0, and the federal government could not legally condition Medicaid 1.0 support on participation in Medicaid 2.0.</p> \n<p>The state exchanges, built from scratch just for Obamacare, were always a ""new program."" And so, establishing state exchanges has always been fundamentally optional. That's why there's a federal backstop written into the law for the exchanges, but not for Medicaid. The government recognized the difference.</p> \n<p>Starting a new program, without existing rules and regulatory regimes, Congress wouldn't have been oblique in their alleged scheme to withhold subsidies on federal exchanges. It is eminently clear from the bills that eventually became the Affordable Care Act that Congress knew how to use explicit conditions to threaten states; <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2014/07/29/senate-documents-and-interviews-undercut-bombshell-lawsuit-against-obamacare/"">they did that in the old bills</a>. But those conditions fell away in the final legislation.</p> \n<p>""Congress wouldn't have pussyfooted around the threat to withhold subsidies from federal exchanges. It would have made the threat known, and in a manner that the states could understand,"" Bagley <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/7/24/5931067/what-obamacares-latest-challengers-are-getting-wrong"">told me</a>. ""But in fact the states did not see any threat in the ACA — because there wasn't any such threat. In the Medicaid context, they emphatically understood the threat. That's the difference.""</p> \n<h3>4) The ""foresight error"" argument could cut in favor of the government just as easily as it could cut against it</h3> \n<p>Following the rulings, a somewhat novel story emerged from conservatives who rejected the idea that this lawsuit is a consequence of sloppy drafting. Rather than being a ""drafting error"", <a href=""http://www.nationalreview.com/article/383381/obama-versus-obamacare-ramesh-ponnuru/page/0/1"">some argue</a>, perhaps this was a ""foresight error."" The text is clear on the subsidy threat, they argue, but Congress simply never fathomed that states would be noncompliant.</p> \n<p>But this simultaneously assumes two things:</p> \n<ol> \n<li><span>It never occurred to Congress that states would refuse to set up exchanges, and</span></li> \n<li> <span>They invented a giant stick (withholding subsidies) </span><i style=""font-size: 15.555556297302246px; line-height: 1.5;"">just in case</i><span> states refused to set up exchanges. </span> </li> \n</ol> \n<p>To invent a grand scheme, Congress had to think about the grand scheme! And if they devised a grand scheme, they would have made their scheme more clearly. Clearly enough, at least, that it wouldn't confuse federal appeals courts.</p> \n<p><q class=""right"" aria-hidden=""true"">we can't sketch intent into the empty contours of ""congress wasn't thinking""</q></p> \n<p>If you say that ""people believed all states would set up exchanges"" because the subsidies would be withheld, so of course they would, you’re assuming the conclusion. But if Congress wasn’t thinking clearly about the consequences of the words it chose — due to a lack of foresight — that argument wholly supports the notion that Congress was imprecise in the words chose to evince its understanding of ""exchanges."" We can't sketch intent into the empty contours of ""Congress wasn't thinking.""</p> \n<p>A related point: ""All states will set up exchanges"" and ""subsidies are authorized on federal exchanges"" are not mutually exclusive beliefs. The reason many people believed states would establish their own was that the carrot was so big; the ACA authorized unlimited funds for states to scale up marketplaces.</p> \n<p>But federal fallbacks could be required for reasons other than noncompliance. Suppose a state faltered on the technological front, and the federal government had to step in. Or they may have had a legislature that met every other year, like Texas, preventing authorizing language from being passed.<b> </b>Do <i>Halbig</i> proponents really believe that Obamacare would withhold subsidies from citizens in these cases?</p> \n<h3>5) The courts won't really care what Jonathan Gruber — or reporters — knew, or when they knew it</h3> \n<p>Normally, the news cycle would have swallowed <i>Halbig</i> by now and we'd have moved on to other important matters — like, say, whether or not the doctor shortage is real.</p> \n<p>But then, something happened: a blogger surfaced a video of Jonathan Gruber, one of Obamacare's architects, appearing to make the plaintiffs' case. And then another blogger found a second video. Unabashed glee from Obamacare's opponents ensued.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""right"">those videos aren't very important. not in any legal sense.</q></p> \n<p>I have thoughts on what Gruber said in the videos, but those thoughts aren't important to share here, because those videos aren't very important. Not in any legal sense. The courts are simply more concerned with the <i>actual</i> text of the law than what people are <i>saying</i> about the text of the law. People are mercurial. Statutory text is not.</p> \n<p>Yes, one set of plaintiffs filed a motion using Gruber's comments, but it wasn't to ""prove"" that they were right and the government was wrong. They use Gruber's comments as evidence against the theory that it would be ""implausible"" for Congress to ever condition subsidies. The plaintiffs don't need Jonathan Gruber for that. The original Senate HELP bill undercuts the notion of implausibility without his help — it created explicit conditions — and it does so in the courts' preferred medium: written legislation.</p> \n<p>This  general sentiment is shared by Jonathan Adler, an administrative law <a href=""https://twitter.com/jadler1969/status/494823187210076160"">professor</a> and key architect of these court cases.</p> \n<p>Sure, you could say that these ""revelations"" might bias the judges on a personal level. And maybe that's true. But, as Bagley points out, ""If you think what Gruber said is some evidence about what the ACA means, you can't ignore other, similar evidence. That's cherry-picking.""</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""center"">PEOPLE ARE MERCURIAL.

The FDA recently halted trials on a potential Ebola treatment,http://www.vox.com/2014/8/3/5962381/ebola-outbreak-vaccine-fda-halted-trials,A Canadian pharmaceutical company called Tekmira has been at work for the past few years on an Ebola vaccine called TKM-Ebola.,"<p>Finding money to back an investment in Ebola treatments has been difficult — but not impossible.</p> \n<p>A Canadian pharmaceutical company called Tekmira has been at work for the past few years on an Ebola treatment called <a href=""http://www.tekmira.com/pipeline/tkm-ebola.php"">TKM-Ebola</a><span>. It has been among the most advanced attempts at a drug that could protect against, and treat, the disease — but was also recently dealt a setback by the Food and Drug Administration. </span></p> \n<p>Diseases like Ebola often have <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/7/31/5952665/ebola-virus-vaccine-why-hasnt-it-happened"">difficulty attracting investment</a>, as pharmaceutical companies rarely see a large payday in tackling a disease that has rare outbreaks and affects a low-income area of the world.</p> \n<p>But TKM-Ebola has attracted the interest of the government. The Defense Department awarded it a contract for $140 million in 2010, after the vaccine proved <a href=""http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(10)60357-1/abstract"">completely effective</a> in treating non-human primates in chimps. The government's interest in vaccinating against Ebola is largely rooted in preventing bioterrorism attacks, where the disease could be used a weapon.</p> \n<p>In January, TKM-Ebola began <a href=""http://investor.tekmirapharm.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=819313"">Phase One trials</a><span> with the Food and Drug Administration, injecting its first patient with the drug on January 14. This is the phase where drug companies test whether a drug is safe — that it doesn't create dangerous complications or side effects — before bigger studies look at whether the drug actually works.</span></p> \n<p>The drug got added to the FDA's ""<a href=""http://www.fda.gov/forconsumers/byaudience/forpatientadvocates/speedingaccesstoimportantnewtherapies/ucm128291.htm#fasttrack"">fast track</a>"" schedule two months later, in March. That's a designation given to drugs that can help treat conditions without any current therapies. Once a drug receives that designation, its creators are eligible for more frequent meetings with FDA regulators, aimed at speeding up the drug's development.</p> \n<p>But more recently the federal government has dealt TKM-Ebola a setback: the FDA <a href=""http://investor.tekmirapharm.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=857714"">halted</a> the treatment's phase one trials at the start of July, requesting that Tekmira provide additional information about how the drug actually works, before the company begins giving trial subjects even larger dosages. That happens in Phase One trials to test how much the human body can handle.</p> \n<p>So for the past month now, the TKM-Ebola trial has been on hold as Tekmira pulls together this information. ""Our team is working expediently to respond to the FDA,"" Tekmira chief executive Mark Murray <a href=""http://investor.tekmirapharm.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=860962"">said</a> in a recent statement. ""We are mindful of the need for this important therapeutic in situations such as the ongoing Ebola outbreak in West Africa.""</p> \n<p>TKM-Ebola may not be the only hope: the New York Times <a href=""http://mobile.nytimes.com/2014/08/02/health/effort-to-develop-ebola-vaccine-to-test-on-humans-is-put-on-fast-track.html?referrer=&amp;_r=0"">reported </a>Sunday that unnamed Ebola vaccine has been added to the FDA's Fast Track, and will be injected into human subjects beginning in September.</p> \n<p>Still, both of these treatments are early in the research and development project.

Study: The recession is behind the best news in health care,http://www.vox.com/2014/8/4/5966827/study-the-recession-is-behind-the-best-news-in-health-care,"Just as the economy rebounds, new research finds, so will Americans' medial spending.","<p><span>The recent, steep slowdown in health care costs is mostly a product of the Great Recession — suggesting that as just as the economy rebounds, so will Americans' medical spending.</span></p> \n<p>Whether that's good or bad news depends a bit on your vantage point. The new study, published in the journal <i>Health Affairs</i>, does indicate that health spending will grow faster soon. But it also suggests that about one-third of the slowdown <i>wasn't </i>due to the recession — and that could still, on its own, <span>have a huge effect on overall health spending.</span></p> \n<p>""If we trimmed the amount they estimate not to be due to the recession off of health spending for a decade, that would amount to saving $2 trillion over a decade,"" says Larry Levitt, senior vice president for special initiatives at the Kaiser Family Foundation.

It exploits the fact that the recession hit some cities harder than others to look at the relationship between an economic downturn and medical spending.</p> \n<p>Las Vegas, for example, was especially hard hit and had a steep decline in employment rates between 2008 and 2010 — unlike Dallas, which had a much smaller dip in its employment-to-population ratio.</p> \n<p>Dranove and his co-authors use that variation to explore a big question: when the economy goes south, what happens to private health insurance spending?</p> \n<p><span>What they found was that cities with worse recessions, places like Las Vegas and Birmingham, had slow economic growth — and tiny increases in medical spending. </span><span>In Dallas and other cities with relatively mild downturns, however, health spending grew much faster. </span></p> \n<p><span>And that suggests a relationship between an overall, economic slowdown — and one specific to the health care sector. You can see that in this chart, which looks at the relationship between health spending growth and a city's employment-to-population ratio.</span></p> \n<p><img alt=""Healthaffairs"" class=""photo"" src=""http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/assets/4856430/healthaffairs.png""></p> \n<p class=""caption""> </p> \n<p>""We asked what happened in places where the economy went in the tank and where it did just fine,"" David Dranove, the lead study author, says. ""And we found the health spending slowdown was really confined to people who were also hit by the Great Recession.""</p> \n<p>Dranove and his colleagues use this data to estimate that 70 percent of the slowdown in health spending between 2008 and 2010 was due to the Great Recession. Another 30 percent of the slowdown, then, would have still occurred regardless of the economic downturn.</p> \n<p>Put another way: health spending grew 2.6 percentage-points slower between 2009 and 2011 than it did in the three years prior. This paper suggests that 1.76 percentage-points of that slowdown were due to the recession — and the remaining 0.84 percentage point due to something else.</p> \n<h3>A developing consensus: part of the slowdown is structural</h3> \n<p><span>Dranove's research is part of a larger body of research that has tried to tease out the causes of the recent health spending slowdown. All tend to show a mix of causes behind the changes — some economic, and some potentially structural changes to the way health care gets delivered.</span></p> \n<p><q class=""center"" aria-hidden=""true"">""Every reputable study...comes to the conclusion we really have decreased health spending""</q></p> \n<div style=""text-align:center""></div> \n<p>""There's a consensus that there is some of each, and that there has been a real slowdown independent of the economic slowdown,"" says Levitt, whose own research estimates, similar to Dranove, attributes three-quarters of the slowdown to the economy.</p> \n<p>""Every reputable study that has looked at this comes to the conclusion that we really have decreased health spending beyond what happened in the economy.""</p> \n<p><img src=""http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/assets/4857168/health_spending_too.png"" class=""photo"" alt=""Health_spending_too""></p> \n<p>As to what changed, that <i>is </i>an area of huge debate. Some health economists (typically those who support the Affordable Care Act) point to the new law as the reason that spending has slowed. Others argue that explanation is implausible, as the slowdown appears to have started prior Obamacare taking effect.</p> \n<p>Harvard University professor David Cutler's research, for example, estimates that 8 percent of the slowdown is due to cuts to Medicare reimbursements, some of which were part of the Obamacare. As to the other 55 percent, in his <a href=""http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/32/5/841.full"">2013 <i>Health Affairs </i>study</a>, that's simply categorized as ""unexplained.""</p> \n<p>""We did have the ACA, we saw some industry consolidation, increasing use of high deductible health plans, better disease management and increasing adoption of electronic records,"" Dranove says. ""All of those things matter and, taken together, they could have contributed to the slowdown.""</p> \n<h3>A $2 trillion slowdown</h3> \n<p><span>If those factors do hold steady, they could have a marked impact on overall health spending — even if just accounting for a small fraction of the recent slowdown.</span></p> \n<p><q class=""left"" aria-hidden=""true"">""even in health care, that's real money""</q></p> \n<p>Levitt has estimated that shaving one percentage point off of health care spending growth — just about the amount that both his and Dranove's research attribute to non-recession causes — would cut health spending by $2 billion over the next decade.</p> \n<p>""If we could accomplish that and can sustain that, it would be an enormous change,"" he says. ""The depth of this recession, and its effect on health spending has obscured a huge change that's underlying the slowdown. So much of it is due to the economy that we lose sight of the fact we've made a really big change.""</p>"

Study: Obamacare helped high-risk young adults get mental health treatment,http://www.vox.com/2014/8/5/5968867/obamacare-increased-mental-health-treatment-among-young-adults-who,Mental health and substance use problems happen the most during young adulthood.,"<p>Mental health and substance use problems happen the most during young adulthood. According to a <a href=""http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/33/8/1425.abstract"">new study</a> in Health Affairs, Obamacare may be helping with those disorders.</p> \n<p>Mental health treatment climbed 5.4 percentage points for 18-25 year olds when compared to a similar group of young adults aged 26-35, who were too old to benefit from the expansion of dependent coverage. And the proportion of 18-25 year olds who reported that private insurance paid their mental health bills climbed by about 13 percentage points. This was a substantial change; before the under-26 policy went into effect, nearly 60 percent of 18-25 year olds reported that insurance didn't pay for the mental health services they received.</p> \n<h3>Obamacare's under-26 coverage is having an impact</h3> \n<p>Considering most of it just went into effect this year, we can't say much about the health impacts of Obamacare yet. But this adds to a growing base of evidence that the health law is improving the health and well-being of young adults.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""right"">RESEARCHERS KEYED IN ON YOUNG ADULTS WHO REPORTED PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS</q></p> \n<p>The part of Obamacare that required insurers to extend dependent coverage up to age 26 — instead of terminating coverage at 18 or 24, depending on whether a kid enrolled in college — went into effect in 2010. That means we've accrued enough data through start parsing some of those effects.</p> \n<p>In this study, researchers used a national survey to key in on young adults who had reported serious psychological distress in the previous year, believing this population in particular might seek out mental health and substance abuse services.</p> \n<p>While the gains in mental health treatment were significant, the researchers did not observe a change in the utilization patterns for substance abuse services. It's possible that this reflects gendered patterns in how patients use health care: 62 percent of the ""at risk"" population for mental health services was female, compared to only 38.5% of the population who might be suffering from substance use disorders.</p> \n<h3>Health reform may not explain all of the improvements</h3> \n<p>To be fair, the Affordable Care Act may not be the only thing at play. ""We're talking about a time period during which a lot of stuff is going on,"" said Brendan Saloner, a professor of health policy at Johns Hopkins University and the study's lead author. In 2008, a federal law went into effect that mandated mental health parity, meaning insurers had to make their mental health benefits comparable to traditional or physical health benefits. That could have increased access to mental health care, though it shouldn't have affected the different age groups in different ways. And it's tough to tease out the effects of the recession and recovery from the implementation of this Obamacare provision.</p> \n<p>But, broadly speaking, these results are in line with what we'd expect based on prior research. <a href=""http://www.ebri.org/pdf/briefspdf/EBRI_IB_04-13.No385.ADM.pdf"">Research</a> on a large employer-sponsored plan found that newly-covered dependents (beneficiaries of the same Obamacare provision) were more likely to use mental health and substance abuse treatment than peers of the same age who had the insurance coverage in their own name, rather than as a dependent. And <span>in Oregon, when low-income adults were </span><a style=""background-color: #ffffff;"" href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/6/2/5765472/11-things-most-people-dont-know-about-health-insurance"">randomly assigned</a><span> the chance to enroll in Medicaid, health coverage through the public insurance program substantially decreased the rate of depression. </span></p>"

An appendectomy can cost anywhere between <a style=""line-height: 1.5;"" href=""http://wapo.st/K5HIC5%20"">$15,000 and $186,000</a>. Doctors don't usually feel the need to make their prices competitive when shoppers can't see them.</p> \n<p>Over the past two years the Blue Cross and Blue Shield health plans have been running a quiet experiment, to see what would happen if prices became available in some cities but not others. And they found that just the act of making prices available can have a really dramatic impact on what they had to spend to get patients a very basic procedure.</p> \n<h3>How much is that MRI in the window?</h3> \n<p><span>For the experiment, the Blue Cross Blue Shield plans used a very standard procedure, an MRI scan, where there's little (if any) variation in quality from one provider to another. </span></p> \n<p>In St. Louis and Atlanta, for example, patients would be told how much an MRI would cost at different providers. But in Chicago and Kansas City they wouldn't get that information; they would go about setting up an MRI at their facility of choice, without any data on price.</p> \n<p><img alt=""Map"" class=""photo"" src=""http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/assets/4860468/map.png""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">(<a href=""http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/33/8/1391.full#ref-27"">Health Affairs</a>)</p> \n<p>In the cities where price data was available, there was no penalty for choosing the higher-priced option; consumers weren't told they couldn't go get scanned in the more expensive MRI machine.</p> \n<p>But just providing the data proved to be powerful: in the course of two years, the average price per MRI fell by $95, according to data published in the journal <a href=""http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/33/8/1391.full#ref-27""><i>Health Affairs</i>.</a> Prices at hospitals that didn't post charges rose by $124.</p> \n<p><img alt=""F1.large"" class=""photo"" src=""http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/assets/4860484/F1.large.jpg""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">(<a href=""http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/33/8/1391/F1.large.jpg"">Health Affairs</a>)</p> \n<p>This was mostly the product of consumers shifting their business to the less expensive MRI options, rather than the prices falling.</p> \n<p>The transparency did, however, reduce variation in prices. Hospitals, for example, typically charge more for MRI scans than imaging that happens in a doctor's office or free-standing center. But in the intervention cities, they started lowering their prices to be more similar to the doctor office MRIs — while doctor offices inched their prices upwards a bit towards the hospital rates. All together, price variation fell by 30 percent in the intervention cities.</p> \n<p>This new research suggests that for a very standard, simple imaging procedure like an MRI — one where there is little difference between the quality of different providers — transparency can be powerful. Prices do influence where people seek their health care, once their made available.</p> \n<p>Whether this type of transparency would work for more complicated procedures — a bypass surgery, for example, or knee replacement — is hard to know. Those are situations where patients might want more data about quality, and rightly so.</p> \n<p>But for imaging scans like MRIs providing prices seems like a no-brainer way to cut health care costs without any negative impact on patients.</p>"
The secret to negotiating a lower medical bill,http://www.vox.com/2014/8/6/5971899/the-secret-to-negotiating-a-lower-medical-bill,"Did you know there's sometimes a Prompt Pay Discount, that will reward you for simply paying on time?","<p><span>Earlier this year, I got an unpleasant surprise in my mailbox. A $820.19 surprise, to be exact.</span></p> \n<p>This was a bill from MedStar's National Rehabilitative Network, where I'd recently completed 12 half-hour physical therapy sessions over the winter. The bill was an incomprehensible, three-page mess of billing codes and charges that all totaled up to just over $800 that I owed.</p> \n<p>Even as someone who writes extensively about America's health care system — who had, coincidentally, recently attended a three-day seminar for<a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2014/02/14/when-squirrels-attack-theres-a-medical-code-for-that/""> a story</a> on the subject — I was stuck.</p> \n<p><q class=""center"" aria-hidden=""true"">""We negotiate for cars and things at markets. health care shouldn't be any different.""</q></p> \n<p>I thought about trying to negotiate the bill down but had no idea where to start. I ultimately paid it without protest — but, after talking to medical billing advocates this week, I'm starting to think I shouldn't have.</p> \n<p>""We negotiate for cars and we negotiate for things at markets,"" says Marty Rosen, a former Aetna executive who now the executive vice president at Health Advocate. ""Health care really shouldn't be any different. What we've found is just asking for a discount, more often than not, you can get it.""</p> \n<p>I talked to three people who currently, or have previously, negotiated medical bills for a living. They walked me through the most important steps to lowering a big medical bill — ones that I wish I had heeded a few months back.</p> \n<h3>Step one: Stay in-network</h3> \n<p>Yes, this is a boring tip — but its also the one that the three medical billing advocates emphasized, again and again, was the absolute most important advice. The best way to avoid high medical bills is not to negotiate them, but never get the bills in the first place.</p> \n<p>Yes, sometimes an emergency room visit is unavoidable. An unconscious patient is unlikely to direct their ambulance to the closest, in-network facility. But in general, this is something that patients do have control over, and an easy area to exercise judgement.</p> \n<p>""It's an unpleasant surprise, one that usually happens after the fact and was, in many cases, completely avoidable,"" says Mark Rukavina, a principal at Community Health Advisors LLC, who has previously done work advising clients on negotiating bills.</p> \n<p><span>Most insurance plans typically have an online directory of who is in network. If that feels too cumbersome, you can typically call your doctor up and ask if they accept your health insurance.</span></p> \n<h3><span>Step Two: Negotiate beforehand</span></h3> \n<p>The moment before you've had any medical services at all is arguably the moment you have the most leverage as a patient, Rosen says. This is the best moment to find out how much your care costs — when you still have time to see a different doctor, or at least threaten to — and request a discount.</p> \n<p><q class=""left"" aria-hidden=""true"">before you've had medical care, you have more leverage</q></p> \n<p>One specific thing that uninsured patients can ask doctors: whether they will charge them the rate they charge health insurance companies. That rate tends to be lower than the sticker price, because the health plan employs its own professional negotiators to set a rate it pays the doctor.</p> \n<p>And even if you're someone who has coverage, but also has a large deductible, there is exactly zero harm in asking your provider to charge less. The best case scenario is a discount — and the worse case scenario is a polite no.</p> \n<p>Rosen told me about a time he was seeing a periodontist, who had told him a certain procedure he needed would cost $2,400. At the time, he lacked dental insurance.</p> \n<p>""I'd been going to this dentist for a long time and I asked, could you at least charge me what you would accept from an insurance plan?"" he recalls. ""Without much of a conversation, I was told, yes, we'll accept the rate we would have gotten from insurer X, Y, or Z. That $2,400 fell to something like $1,800.""</p> \n<h3>Step Three: Check your bill for errors</h3> \n    <img alt=""97946068"" class=""photo"" src=""http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/assets/4863040/97946068.jpg""> \n<p class=""caption"">We're talking about medical bills here, right? (Bill Pugliano / Getty Images)</p> \n<p>This is where we head into bill negotiating territory, that moment when you open up an envelope from your doctor and see some ungodly high charge listed at the bottom.</p> \n<p>The first course of action should be to check whether the doctor made a mistake on your medical bill, potentially billing you for the wrong item or including duplicate charges. This happens with surprising frequency: the American Medical Association estimates that one in ten medical bills are processed incorrectly by the health insurer.</p> \n<p>""We've seen things that are overcharged, where someone will go in for surgery on their left knee and also get billed for their right knee,"" Derek Fitteron, president of Medical Cost Advocates, a medical bill negotiating firm. ""Some of these can be simple to spot. Some of this can be in codes and modifiers that are beyond what a typically consumer can read.""</p> \n<p><q class=""center"" aria-hidden=""true"">approximately one in ten doctor bills are processed incorrectly</q></p> \n<p>If a medical bill is unintelligible, Fitteron recommends reaching out to a medical billing advocate. This recommendation has some obvious self-interests — as this is the type of business that he runs — but can also make sense in certain situations. Medical Cost Advocates, for example, doesn't charge an upfront fee for using their service but will keep a percent of whatever the recoup. Even in a worse case scenario then, you wouldn't be out any money — just without a discount.</p> \n<h3>Step Four: Ask for a Prompt Pay Discount</h3> \n<p>Some doctor offices actually have a formal policy, known as a <a href=""http://www.texmed.org/template.aspx?id=25341"">Prompt Pay Discount,</a> that rewards patients with a discount for literally just paying on time. Collecting medical bills can be a huge hassle for physicians; many would prefer to secure a payment right away, even if it means getting a slightly smaller amount.</p> \n<p>""Sometimes Prompt Pay Discounts can be about 20 to 30 percent off the bill,"" Rukavina says.</p> \n<p>And even if your doctor doesn't have an official policy, the three billing experts I talked to all agreed offering to pay quickly was the best negotiating tool available. When doctors have to send bills to collections, that means the collections agency will take a cut of whatever gets recouped. And that's only if they actually chase down a payment. So its often in the doctor's interest to give a discount for paying quickly, because they know they're actually getting a decent part of the bill.</p> \n<p>""Part of it is about being honest and appealing to why you need the discount,"" says Fitteron. ""If you're ready to pay a reduced price right at that moment of negotiation, like actually have your credit card ready, the doctor may be more inclined to get into negotiations.""</p> \n<h3>Step Five: Don't be an asshole</h3> \n<p>Negotiating medical bills is really different from negotiating<a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/6/5/5780348/comcast""> cable bills.</a> In the latter situation, your cable company is trying to convince you to stick with your service; you have most of the leverage over deciding whether that will happen. That might give a little more space for some less than polite behavior.</p> \n<div class=""align-left""></div> \n<p><q class=""left"" aria-hidden=""true"">""Be honest and humble. When your bill is correct, you're not entitled to anything.""</q></p> \n<p>But when you're negotiating medical bills, you're essentially at the whims of your doctor. They're under no obligation to give you a discount, no matter how compelling of a case you might make.</p> \n<p>I asked Fitteron whether he had any tips for starting a conversation with your doctors' office: if your bill isn't wrong, but you just think its too expensive, what do you say?</p> \n<p>""We recommend folks be honest and humble,"" he says. ""When your bill is correct, you're not entitled to anything. I would call up and say, 'I want to explain the situation I'm in right now, and I know the bill is right, but would it be possible to knock a certain percentage off if I pay you right away?""</p>"
How Arkansas explains the politics of Obamacare,http://www.vox.com/2014/8/6/5972209/how-arkansas-explains-the-politics-of-obamacare,Arkansas characterizes a new 'me-too' approach to conservative Medicaid expansions.,"<p>Arkansas was a pioneer in crafting an ""alternative"" Medicaid expansion. Last September, the Obama administration <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/09/27/arkansas-is-using-this-weird-trick-to-expand-medicaid/"">signed off</a> on their unprecedented proposal to move hundreds of thousands of newly-eligible people into the state's health insurance exchange, using Medicaid dollars to pay private premiums.</p> \n<p>As the state's ""private option"" enters its second year, Arkansas is exploring possible changes to the program — ones that Republican-run states have already won approval for, and which could push the limits of how flexible the federal government will be with a program that covers some of the country's most vulnerable patients.</p> \n<h3>Arkansas wants to borrow ideas from Republican-run states</h3> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""right"">THE STATE EXPANDS THROUGH PRIVATE CHANNELS; MEDICAID PICKS UP THE BILL</q></p> \n<p>Under the Arkansas ""private option"" design, almost everyone in Medicaid's expansion population is routed through the state insurance exchange, save for the medically frail, who remain in the traditional program. Medicaid pays for the  same plans — selected from the ""silver"" tier — as people with higher incomes who shop for private coverage. This appealed to conservatives because the state expands through private channels rather than through a public program, even though Medicaid still picks up the bill.</p> \n<p>Earlier this week, the state <a style=""background-color: #ffffff;"" href=""https://www.medicaid.state.ar.us/InternetSolution/General/comment/demowaivers.aspx"">proposed an amendment</a> to their plan that would layer in additional conservative principles. These seem to be largely borrowed from other state efforts to custom-order Medicaid expansions.</p> \n<p>The first new feature, ""independence accounts,"" would require monthly contributions from enrollees living above 50 percent of the poverty line (about $5,800 for an individual). The precise amount would vary by income, but ranges from $5 to $25. These funds would be used to cover deductibles, co-pays, and related costs.</p> \n<p><a style=""line-height: 1.5;"" href=""http://chcs.org/publications3960/publications_show.htm?doc_id=1261620"">Michigan</a> and <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/5/15/5716350/indianas-expanding-medicaid-thats-a-big-deal"">Indiana</a> have both proposed similar cost-sharing schemes; the federal government has approved Michigan's plan while Indiana is still in negotiations.</p> \n<p>The hitch that Arkansas could run into is on enforcement: the federal government has been reluctant to let states enforce severe penalties, like taking away Medicaid coverage, when enrollees don't make nominal payments. The Arkansas plan says that noncompliance would result in debt accruing to the state, but it's unclear whether there would be active collection efforts.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""center"">THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN RELUCTANT TO LET STATES ENFORCE SEVERE PENALTIES WHEN ENROLLEES FAIL TO MAKE NOMINAL PAYMENTS</q></p> \n<p>The state also wants to restrict the use of non-emergency medical transportation. Under traditional Medicaid, enrollees can typically request assistance getting to and from medical appointments, and the program will cover the cost. The low-income populations eligible for Medicaid may not have access to a reliable source of transportation, a problem that can be especially pronounced in rural regions — like Arkansas — that lack a robust public transit system.</p> \n<p>But this type of transportation isn't something that traditional insurers, like the ones offering coverage through Arkansas's ""private option"" are accustomed to providing. As a result, the state needs to find another way to offer wrap these benefits around the private plan, adding a layer of complexity to the coverage.</p> \n<p><span>Iowa was the first state to broach limiting non-emergency transportation for their Medicaid expansion population; the federal government fully waived the requirement under expansion for one year.</span></p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""right"">STATES ARE STILL FIGURING OUT HOW FAR THE ADMINISTRATION WILL BEND.</q></p> \n<p>Arkansas's proposal is less extreme: they want to limit coverage for this kind of transportation to 8 ""legs,"" or 4 round-trips, per beneficiary annually. People who are medically frail — and thus in need of more medical services — won't be subject to this restriction, because the state keeps them in the traditional Medicaid program rather than enrolling them through the private option.</p> \n<p>""Traditionally, there's a bright line between what Medicaid is and what benefits it provides, compared to private insurance on the exchanges,"" says Matt Salo, executive director of the National Association of Medicaid Directors. ""Arkansas is trying to smooth out that bright line.""</p> \n<h3>This is part of a bigger picture</h3> \n<p>Conservative states are still figuring out just how far the administration will bend in allowing states to expand Medicaid on their own terms.</p> \n<p>""Where the administration is willing to go and what they're willing to approve has been evolving,"" Salo says. <span>He credited Arkansas as the state that created a ""middle path"" between expanding and not expanding the public insurance program.

The new Obamacare issue worrying consumer advocates,http://www.vox.com/2014/8/8/5978485/obamacare-issue-worrying-consumer-advocates-reference-pricing,Obamacare's out-of-pocket spending limits could get complicated.,"<p>There's a tool for reducing health costs that many health economists and policy geeks are eager to embrace, but that leaves consumer advocates are somewhat wary. It's called reference pricing, and it's surprisingly controversial.</p> \n<h3>Reference pricing: What is it?</h3> \n<p>In this cost-control scheme, insurers select a fixed price they consider ""fair"" for a given medical procedure, the ""<a href=""http://theincidentaleconomist.com/wordpress/copayments-are-stupid/"">reference price</a>."" Their enrollees are encouraged to shop around to find a doctor; if they find someone who will offer the service at or below the reference price, the insurance covers it in full, or perhaps with a standard co-pay. But if the patient wants to visit a doctor who charges more than that reference price, she's responsible for paying the difference.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""right"">""ECONOMISTS LOVE THAT.""</q></p> \n<p>By encouraging consumers to shop smartly for their care, health care providers are pressured to bring their prices in line with the reference price, or else risk losing customers. This is good for patients and, if scaled up widely and successfully enough, good for the health care system at large.</p> \n<p>This is very different from the current system, where insurers negotiate rates with certain hospitals and doctors, and patients face a (generally fixed) out-of-pocket cost for anyone that the insurer includes in their ""network"". If a patient wants to see someone out-of-network, they often have to foot much more of the bill — sometimes the whole thing — even if an out-of-network doctor is willing to charge comparable rates.</p> \n<p>""Reference pricing gives the individual more choice and uses the resources that insurers are willing to provide more efficiently, so economists love that,"" <span>says Austin Frakt, a health economist with the Department of Veterans Affairs and Boston University.</span></p> \n<h3>Why is this an issue now?</h3> \n<p>Reference pricing isn't widely-used yet; it requires a lot of investment in consumer education and support. But it has been deployed — with <a href=""http://blog.academyhealth.org/reference-pricing-as-an-alternative-to-selective-contracting/"">considerable success</a> — in the past, like with public employees in California.</p> \n<p>As more employers may be weighing the issue, the Obama administration has<span> </span><a href=""http://www.dol.gov/ebsa/faqs/faq-aca19.html"" style=""line-height: 1.5; background-color: #ffffff;"">solicited feedback </a>on the best way to proceed. <span> There's a particularly thorny issue that's caused a small outcry: </span><span>whether </span><span>a patients' spending above and beyond the reference price should count towards federal out-of-pocket limits. </span></p> \n<p><span>Part of Obamacare limits out-of-pocket spending (beyond monthly premiums) to $6,350 per year. But this protection doesn't apply to some kinds of health spending, like if a patient gets care outside their insurer's ""network."" The question here is how to handle spending beyond the reference price. </span></p> \n<p><span>If a patient, for example, goes to a knee surgeon who is $2,000 above her insurer's reference price, should that extra spending count towards the limit? Or would she be on the hook for going above the reasonable price, raising the potential ceiling on her out-of-pocket costs from $6,350 to $8,350?</span></p> \n<p><span>Consumer advocates have also raised other concerns about reference pricing harming patients.</span></p> \n<h3><span>Why are consumer advocates worried?</span></h3> \n<p><span>Consumer advocates don't reject the idea of reference pricing; they see it as a useful tool for correcting the crazy and unwarranted price variation that characterizes American health care. But they want to make sure it's implemented in a way that doesn't harm the very people that insurance is supposed to protect.</span></p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""right"">INSURERS COULD USE REFERENCE PRICING ABUSIVELY.</q></p> \n<p><span>Families USA, a non-profit that supports Obamacare, has flagged several concerns.</span></p> \n<p>The group wants expenses beyond the reference price — the extra $2,000 spent at the knee surgeon — to count towards a patients out-of-pocket max. This would, Families USA argues, block insurers from using reference pricing as a scheme to get around the out-of-pocket limit.</p> \n<p>The group has also suggested that some services where there isn't much consumer choice — trips to the emergency room, for example, or highly specialized care — ought to be exempt. Instead, reference pricing ought to be limited to standard procedures like lab tests, <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/8/5/5970685/when-health-care-prices-stop-being-hidden-and-start-getting-real"">imaging scans</a>, and certain kinds of surgery.</p> \n<p><span>Economists argue that some of these changes — particularly exempting spending beyond the reference price from the out-of-pocket limit — would undercut the whole idea. The point of this type of plan is to incentivize shoppers to choose less expensive providers. </span></p> \n<p><span>""Counting dollars spent over the reference price against the out-of-pocket-limit would take away a lot of the market mechanism in reference pricing,"" Frakt told me. Some of these services — like surgeries — are predictably expensive. Patients could meet their out-of-pocket limit in a single procedure, and then they wouldn't have reason to be prudent about health spending for the rest of the year.</span></p>"

This big hospital pay-for-performance program failed in year one,http://www.vox.com/2014/8/8/5980005/this-big-obamacare-hospital-reform-failed-in-year-one,"A key Obamacare program that uses bonus payments to improve medical care didn't work in its first year, new research suggests.","<p><span>A </span><a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/how-doctors-are-paid/what-is-the-quality-incentive-program"">key Obamacare program</a><span> that uses bonus payments to improve medical care didn't work in its first year, new research suggests. </span></p> \n<p>The program is called <a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/how-doctors-are-paid/what-is-the-quality-incentive-program"">Hospital Value Based Purchasing</a>, and it's meant to reward hospitals that do really well at 20 metrics, including things like responding quickly to heart attacks and giving patients discharge instructions when they leave the hospitals.</p> \n<p>Beginning in <a href=""http://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Quality-Initiatives-Patient-Assessment-Instruments/hospital-value-based-purchasing/index.html?redirect=/hospital-value-based-purchasing"">2011</a>, hospitals stood to lose as much as 1 percent of their Medicare revenue if they did badly at these measures — or earn an additional 1 percent if they outperformed their competitors.</p> \n<p><span>This put a total of </span><a href=""http://www.kaiserhealthnews.org/stories/2013/november/14/value-based-purchasing-medicare.aspx"">$1.1 billion</a><span> at risk for hospitals, who could either earn part of that pool of funds by doing really well — or end up paying into it when they didn't hit the right targets. </span></p> \n<p><span>The aim of the penalty and reward system was to encourage all hospitals to improve the care they deliver. That might not have happened.</span></p> \n<h3>Hospitals with incentives didn't do any better</h3> \n<p>Weill Cornell Medical College's Andrew Ryan worked with a team of researchers to look at how hospitals did on quality measures since this new program began. The research looks at the hospitals in the incentive program and compares them against a smaller number left out (Maryland hospitals, for example, didn't participate because they have a <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/maryland-pressing-for-expanded-powers-over-hospitals/2013/05/24/8adf92fe-b8c1-11e2-b94c-b684dda07add_story.html"">totally different payment scheme</a> worked out with the feds).</p> \n<p>Ryan and his team matched up hospitals in and out of the program that had similar quality metrics before the incentives kicked in. Then they looked at whether the hospitals in the incentive program improved faster than the ones left out. They <a href=""http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1475-6773.12206/abstract"">found</a> no difference.</p> \n<p>""We found that the timing of the hospital value-based purchasing system wasn't associated with any additional improvement,"" Ryan says. ""We would have hoped to have seen more responsiveness.""</p> \n<h3>Why didn't it work?</h3> \n<p>It's possible that the incentives in this particular program might be too small to encourage hospital administrators to make big investments. They could be making a calculation: it would be more work than it's worth to do better. In the United Kingdom, for example, a full 20 percent of doctors' pay is tethered to how well they do their job.</p> \n<p>This particular bonus program will grow, but only slightly: in 2017, hospitals will have 2 percent of their Medicare revenue at risk with these quality metrics.</p> \n<p>""I still think that's really pretty small but I hope it's enough to get hospitals focused,"" says Ryan. ""They have to make a cost benefit analysis and say, it makes sense to invest in improving these things.""</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""center"">""WE WOULD HAVE HOPED TO HAVE HAD MORE RESPONSIVENESS""</q></p> \n<p>One other possibility: Ryan and his colleagues noticed, in the data, is that when you look back at 2008, there is some evidence that hospitals were improving back then at a faster rate than the non-participants. This suggests that hospitals may have begun improving quality in preparation for these policy changes a few years in advance, and are now reaping the benefits of that advance planning.</p> \n<p>""It's hard to say whether the effect we observed is responsiveness to the new policy or it's just that they happened to start improving at that particular moment,"" Ryan says.</p> \n<p>This would have meant the hospitals were preparing for the program two years prior to the Affordable Care Act passing, and would have had a sense whether they would fall in the bonus pool or not.</p> \n<p>At the same time, there has been talk of a program like this <a href=""http://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Quality-Initiatives-Patient-Assessment-Instruments/HospitalQualityInits/HospitalPremier.html"">since about 2003</a>, when some initial results from a small group of hospitals suggested these type of incentives <i>could </i>make a difference. So it's possible, but by no means certain, that advanced preparation did improve outcomes — but hospitals couldn't make any further gains when the reward program actually came into effect.</p> \n<p>(<i>Hat tip to Jordan Rau at Kaiser Health News for noticing this study</i><a href=""http://capsules.kaiserhealthnews.org/index.php/2014/08/first-look-at-medicare-quality-incentive-program-finds-little-benefit/""> first</a><i>)</i></p>"

Although energy drinks don't always have as much sugar as soda, they're loaded with far more caffeine:</p> \n<p><img alt=""Caffeine"" class=""photo"" src=""http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/assets/4888282/caffeine.png""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">(<a href=""http://www.publichealthadvocacy.org/healthhalo.html"">""Hiding Under a Health Halo""</a>)</p> \n<p>Americans tend to think of caffeine as a benign substance.

""Kids are actually using [energy drinks] as the beverage of their choice,"" Crawford says.</p> \n<p>The American Academy of Pediatrics <a href=""http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-living/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/caffeine/art-20049372"">recommends</a> adolescents drink no more than 100 milligrams of caffeine a day.

Among people with a fairly common genetic mutation that slows the breakdown of caffeine in the body, it can even <a href=""http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-living/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/expert-answers/coffee-and-health/faq-20058339"">increase the risk of heart disease</a>.</p> \n<p><q class=""right"" aria-hidden=""true"">""What we need to be hydrated is water""</q></p> \n<p><a href=""http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/09/130924091323.htm"">A 2013 study conducted on rats</a>, published in PLoS ONE, also found caffeine slows down brain development during puberty. The study's authors acknowledged that more research is needed to clarify caffeine's developmental effects on humans, but the initial findings suggest some risks toward heavy caffeine consumption among teens.</p> \n<p>Caffeine isn't the only additive that's of concern to public health officials. ""There's this whole list of crazy ingredients that have never been deemed safe by the National Institutes of Health for teens to consume at all,"" says Goldstein of CCPHA. ""I don't think most people have any idea what these things are. They're on the package, and commonly people think, 'They must be good for me. They must have benefit. That's why they're being promoted like that.'""</p> \n<p>These drinks are often marketed as if they're good for someone's health or as a good source of energy. Sports drinks in particular are advertised as a way for teens to replenish vital nutrients and energy. While Gatorade and Powerade can rehydrate someone and replace lost electrolytes (salts, essentially), someone would only need that kind of instant replenishment if he or she is consistently engaging in hours of rigorous exercise — a level of physical activity that is extremely rare among teens and America as a whole.</p> \n<p>""What we need to be hydrated is water. We don't need to be drinking sugar and salt every time we're thirsty,"" Goldstein says. ""One of the purposes of exercise is to burn off calories.

""We also need to have the FDA test these additives for consumption by kids and teens, so we know one way or the other which ones are okay.""</p> \n<p>Some health experts want harsher measures. Robert Lustig, a professor of pediatrics at the University of California, San Francisco, <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/6/2/5771008/the-case-for-treating-sugar-like-a-drug"">argues</a> sugar should be taxed and regulated like a controlled substance, because it's <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/6/30/5855404/you-might-be-addicted-to-sugar-heres-how/in/5551015"">addictive</a> and widely misused.

Obamacare's secret crime-fighting potential,http://www.vox.com/2014/8/13/5996191/obamacares-secret-crime-fighting-potential,Medicaid expansion could reduce the number of ex-inmates who return to prison.,"<p>The primary purpose of Obamacare's Medicaid expansion is to enroll millions more Americans into health coverage. But it could also have an unintended secondary effect: reducing crime in the United States.</p> \n<p>The Medicaid expansion opens the public insurance program to a low-income group that, for decades, it has typically excluded: adults without children. Many prisoners leaving jail fall into this category — and could stand to benefit from the insurance expansion. That new coverage, experts say, could expand access to needed services in a way that could reduce future criminal behavior.</p> \n<h3>\n<span>People with behavioral health issues often end up incarcerated instead of </span>in treatment</h3> \n<p>People who interact with the correctional system have typically been left out of the Medicaid program.</p> \n<p>About 88 percent of people with jail stays are male and nearly half are under age 25, a<span>ccording to a </span><a href=""http://www.cbpp.org/cms/index.cfm?fa=view&amp;id=4157"" style=""line-height: 1.5; background-color: #ffffff;"">policy brief</a><span> by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Medicaid, meanwhile, has usually covered, pregnant women, the elderly, the disabled and low-income adults with children. </span></p> \n<p><span>Prisoners don't have Medicaid while they're incarcerated, but expanding the public program means health coverage for more of this population after release. And it's a population that can benefit from that coverage: people in jail have higher rates of chronic diseases like diabetes, hepatitis, and HIV/AIDS.</span></p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""right"">11 percent of inmates with these disorders received treatment.</q></p> \n<p>A 2005 <a href=""http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/mhppji.pdf"">report</a> from the Department of Justice also highlights the prevalence of mental illness among the incarcerated population. That year, over half of prison and jail inmates reportedly had a mental health problem. Inmates with mental health problems were also substantially more likely to use illegal drugs; three-quarters of the incarcerated population with mental illness met criteria for substance dependence or abuse.</p> \n<p>Prisoners with these types of medical issues are more likely to re-enter the correctional system after release or parole when compared to ex-inmates without mental health or substance abuse issues, according to the report.</p> \n<p>And only <a href=""http://www.cbpp.org/cms/index.cfm?fa=view&amp;id=4157"">11 percent</a> of inmates with these disorders received treatment during their stays in jail.</p> \n<p><b></b><span>Before Obamacare, many ex-inmates would have had limited, if any, access to services to treat these issues after release. But under health reform, the Medicaid expansion includes coverage for mental health and substance abuse services, and they have to cover them at parity — they can't be treated differently from ""physical"" health benefits.</span></p> \n<h3>Evidence to date is promising, though not conclusive</h3> \n<p>A small body of research suggests that better access to health care upon leaving prison can reduce the number of ex-convicts who end up incarcerated a second time.</p> \n<p>In 2007, Michigan enacted the <a href=""http://www.innovations.ahrq.gov/content.aspx?id=2134"">Prisoner Reentry Initiative</a>, which, among other things, connected individuals recently released from prison with health care services. The ex-inmates were paired with ""medical homes"" and given assistance in accessing primary care, specialty care, and medicine.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""center"">Recidivism has fallen from 46 percent to 21.8 percent among that population. </q></p> \n<p>Since the program began, overall recidivism has <a href=""http://www.innovations.ahrq.gov/content.aspx?id=2134"">fallen</a> among that population from 46 percent to 21.8 percent. It's impossible to say how much of this is attributable to the health care initiative, but staff members believe that it made a substantial contribution.</p> \n<p>It was a resource-intensive effort, though. Medical navigators visited inmates before release to help initiate a transition back into the community. That involved organizing a transfer of medical records to the individual's new doctor, setting up a primary care visit within two weeks of release or parole, and arranging prescription drug coverage.</p> \n<p>The Department of Justice found <a href=""http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/33/3/468.abstract"">similar trends</a> in Florida and Washington state after ex-inmates were connected with Medicaid services.</p> \n<p>""I don't think we should be over-selling this, but I think that there is genuine benefit here,"" says Harold Pollack, a professor of public policy and co-director of the University of Chicago Crime Lab. ""One of the key unknowns is whether these programs will be implemented effectively, in a way that actually engages people.""</p> \n<h3>There are still wrinkles in providing access to these services</h3> \n<p>While any access to mental health and substance abuse services is an improvement over no access at all, there are some issues that still need to be worked out.</p> \n<p>Many ex-inmates who suffer from such disorders might benefit from residential treatment — therapy that's delivered at a facility where they also live. But under Medicaid expansion, many of these patients will only have access to outpatient services.</p> \n<p>Medicaid has to <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/11/health/obamacare-substance-abuse-treatment-hurdles.html"">abide by a rule</a> forbidding the use of federal Medicaid dollars to pay for mental health services in residential facilities larger than 16 beds, if those residential facilities are primarily used to treat mental health or substance abuse disorders. This regulation dates back decades, to a time when such institutions for too often held the mentally ill in barbarous conditions.</p> \n<p>And sorting out the nitty-gritty of mental health and substance abuse benefits will fall to individual states.</p> \n<p>""The scope is always in question — what does that mean is covered, how much is covered? That's going to depend a lot of the states,"" said Judy Solomon, vice president for health policy at the CBPP. ""Are the states really going to be creative and do this in a way that's consistent with best evidence? That would be inclusive of a range of social and community-support services.""</p> \n<p>And there's another ""scope"" issue to consider: <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/8/12/5995485/map-these-24-states-are-losing-billions-by-not-expanding-medicaid"">24 states</a> still haven't expanded the public program at all.</p>"

Not all infants were affected equally: among the group exposed during the first trimester, that figure climbs to 6.8 percentage points. Both are substantial increases over the baseline probability of about 8 percent.</p> \n<p>Boys were more likely to suffer from adverse birth outcomes than girls, which is consistent with an existing ""fragile male"" theory in the medical literature; males generally seem to be more sensitive to in-utero shocks than females.</p> \n<h3>This is a more controversial finding than you might think</h3> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""right"">past research hadn't shown an effect of dust on birth outcomes.</q></p> \n<p>There are a lot of factors that are associated with adverse birth outcomes: having a low socioeconomic status, poor nutrition, inadequate prenatal care, smoking.

Carcinogenic and mutagenic air pollutant levels were some of the highest ever reported outdoors.</p> \n<p>But, puzzlingly, past research hadn't shown any effects of exposure to the toxic dust from the World Trade Center collapse on birth outcomes. <span>Maybe, the authors hypothesized, there were problems with how the past studies had been conducted.</span></p> \n<p>The women who lived in the neighborhoods most affected by the 9/11 dust were systematically different from women in other parts of New York City, and past research didn't account for that very well. The neighborhood around the World Trade Center is a wealthy one; generally speaking, these women enjoyed socioeconomic advantages that made them more likely to have healthy births. Comparing a group of advantaged women to a group of ""average"" controls could obscure effects from the dust cloud.</p> \n<p>To work around these issues, the authors decided to compare birth outcomes across children with the same mother. Some were exposed to the dust in utero, while their siblings functioned as ""controls"", having been born either before or conceived after the catastrophe. This way, things that stay constant in the mother across time — like her general health habits and her socioeconomic status — wouldn't bias the study results.</p>"

If you served popcorn with more than 1,000 calories, you probably would lobby against this regulation too.</p> \n<p>The movie theaters lobbied hard and they won: in preliminary regulations, the Food and Drug Administration said the regulation would only apply to establishments that devote 50 percent or more of their square footage to the preparation, sale, and consumption of food. This left movie theaters out as well as grocery stores, golf courses, bowling alleys and other fun locations (ice cream parlors, meanwhile, were not as lucky: they do have to comply with the regulation, and should perhaps consider better lobbyists).</p> \n<p>But now Democratic legislators are fighting back: Sen. Tom Harkin (D-IA) and Rep. Rosa DeLauro (D-CT), who both worked on this part of the law, sent <a href=""http://delauro.house.gov/images/pdf/Letter%20to%20OMB%20reMenu%20Labeling%20Rule%20081514.pdf"">a letter </a>Friday to the FDA saying it was their express intent that establishments including movie theaters and grocery stores (another group the FDA left out) <i>should </i>have to post calorie information.</p> \n<p>""The aim was not to confine the scope of the law solely to restaurants … but to apply broadly to restaurants as well as other retail food establishments,"" Harkin and DeLauro write in their letter. ""The proposed definition is narrower than that intended by Congress.""</p> \n<p>Whether the movie theater lobby can win a second round remains to be seen when the FDA issues final regulations on the calorie labels. The fate of popcorn — and ridiculously large packages of cookie dough bites, Sour Patch Kids and those giant sodas that Mike Bloomberg has <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/6/26/5845478/the-bloomberg-large-soda-ban-is-officially-dead"">yet to squash</a> — hangs in the balance.</p>"

First, they looked at what we know from prior studies of how much salt increases the risk of death from heart disease.

High consumption is pretty much an international norm: 181 of the 189 countries studies exceeded the recommended intake.</p> \n<h3>More sodium intake means more deaths</h3> \n<p>There is a lengthy body of research tying higher sodium intake to higher blood pressure — and then, in turn, tying that to higher rates of death from cardiovascular events, like heart attacks and strokes.</p> \n<p>The researchers here used those estimates to extrapolate out how many deaths the world's increased taste for salt causes.

"Good news for Obamacare: Health coverage is soaring, but health care prices aren't",http://www.vox.com/2014/8/19/6044635/obamacare-health-prices-growing-slowly,Health care prices are growing slowly. Here's why that matters.,"<p>Health care prices have grown really slowly this summer, a piece of good economic news released by the <a style=""background-color: #ffffff;"" href=""http://www.bls.gov/news.release/cpi.nr0.htm"">Bureau of Labor Statistics</a><span> Tuesday. </span></p> \n<p>The price of medical care commodities, which includes drugs and other medical  devices, grew 0.3 percent from June to July. That was one of the lowest monthly increases all year. Growth over the previous year was 3 percent.</p> \n<p>Prices for medical care services (like health insurance and hospital care) grew an even smaller 0.1 percent over the same time  month and 2.5 percent over the year. <span>This matters just as much — or maybe more — than news about total health spending.</span></p> \n<h3>Prices are really important in health care</h3> \n<p>Prices matter because they affect total overall health spending. The country might spend more on health care because more people are <i>gaining access </i>to health care while prices grow at a normal rate, and that wouldn't terribly alarming.</p> \n<p>But if the prices attached to health services accelerate faster than the general inflation — and if we're not getting better care for those higher prices — it suggests that health spending is growing in a less healthy way.</p> \n<p>The federal government isn't the only one noticing the slow growth. The Altarum Institute, a nonprofit research organization, has <a style=""background-color: #ffffff;"" href=""http://altarum.org/sites/default/files/uploaded-related-files/CSHS-Price-Brief_August%202014_0.pdf"">charted</a> growth in health care prices, comparing monthly prices to the month of the previous year.

This was a big deal: the inexorable climb of health expenses has plagued the nation for decades, and remains the primary culprit behind the nation’s projected long-term fiscal problems. June's report marked the largest decline we’ve seen in over 30 years.</p> \n<p>But we should probably expect to see an uptick in health spending sometime soon. It makes sense: the number of uninsured people has been plummeting, and when more people use health care, spending generally goes up.</p> \n<p>The first-quarter numbers were anomalous in this regard, but they wouldn't have captured Obamacare's entire ""March enrollment surge"" — people wouldn't have started using their insurance until a few weeks after signed up for a plan. Experts have also <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/6/25/5841716/health-spending-actually-fell-while-obamacare-insured-americans"">suggested</a> some people may need time to figure out their new plans and that the unusually cold winter weather may have dampened use of medical services.</p> \n<h3>Total health spending is only part of the story</h3> \n<p>When we see that increase in total health spending happen, it's not necessarily bad news. The underlying trends matter: we need to understand what's happening besides ""more people are getting and using insurance.""</p> \n<p><q class=""right"" aria-hidden=""true"">the underlying trends matter.</q></p> \n<p>Medical prices are a trend we should care about a lot and slow growth — like what the Altarum Institute has charted — is a good thing.

General trends in Medicare expenditures also matter, because the program — which has shared in the industry-wide spending slowdown — is considered <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/6/15/5807046/orszag-its-time-for-some-optimism-about-health-care-spending"">less sensitive</a> to influence from broader economic trends.</p> \n<p>It's still not entirely clear what's driving the slowdown in spending. A recent paper argued that <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/8/4/5966827/study-the-recession-is-behind-the-best-news-in-health-care"">70 percent</a> of the slowdown can be attributed to the recessions.

Longevity improved for both races over the next two decades — and those improvements were better than most of the nation — but the gap didn't really narrow.

By 2017, the state planned to have health-care costs grow <i>slower </i>than the rest of the economy — something that never happens anywhere in the United States.</p> \n<p>Massachusetts' budget cap kicked in last year and, earlier this morning, the state <a href=""http://www.mass.gov/chia/docs/r/pubs/14/chia-annual-report-2014.pdf"">reported</a> a victory: it stayed within the 2013 growth limits.</p> \n<p>Massachusetts set a target to have health-care costs grow no faster than 3.6 percent in 2013. New data from the Center for Health Information and Analysis (or, as it's known by its amazing acronym, CHIA), shows that health costs grew by an average of 2.3 percent per person in Massachusetts.</p> \n<p><img style=""font-size: 15.5555562973022px; line-height: 1.5;"" src=""http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/677844/chia1.0.png"" class=""small"" alt=""massachusetts costs""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">(<a href=""http://www.mass.gov/chia/docs/r/pubs/14/chia-annual-report-2014.pdf"">Massachusetts Center for Health Information and Analysis</a>)</p> \n<p><span>The good news: per capita health-care costs grew slower than Massachusetts had hoped.

""Moreover, health care expenditure growth has been slowing nationwide.

By 2017, the state aims to have health-care costs growing 0.5 percent slower than the rest of the economy.

If you set  participants loose and ask them to report back on their calorie intake  with little monitoring, you'll still get an inaccurate view because  people are notoriously bad at remembering what they ate and frequently <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1454084"">underestimate</a> their calorie consumption.<br><br>Studying diet is also really expensive. So studies tend to be short  term, and again not reflective of real-world outcomes. And we know most  people, sadly, regain the weight they lose after a while, so in order to  understand whether a diet truly works, a study needs to run for more  than a year... and it's therefore more expensive and difficult to fund.</p> \n<p><img src=""http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/679082/169160591.0.jpg"" class=""small"" alt=""med diet""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">The Mediterranean diet.

Here's why CVS stopped selling cigarettes today,http://www.vox.com/2014/9/3/6101521/cvs-cigarette-sales-ended-heres-why,The pharmacy chain will lose $2 billion in annual revenue â€” but its making a bet on the long-term future of health care.,"<p>Beginning this morning, Americans can no longer purchase cigarettes at CVS' 7,700 pharmacies. The pharmacy chain — which is the second largest in the United States, after Walgreens — had announced earlier this year plans to end tobacco sales. And today, the company <a href=""http://www.cvshealth.com/research-insights/health-topics/were-tobacco-free"">followed through</a>: cigarettes are off the shelves.</p> \n<p>The move came along with a bigger rebranding of CVS, which changed its name today to <a href=""http://www.cvshealth.com/"">CVS Health</a>. With an eye on Obamacare, the pharmacy chain has increasingly aimed to position itself as a health care provider — somewhere you could go to get medical services with faster access than a traditional doctors office. Selling cigarettes, CVS says, would run up against that new mission.</p> \n<p>So while CVS does expect to lose $2 billion in annual sales — about 3 percent of the chain's total revenue — they're making a much more long term, strategic play here. They're betting that health care is changing in two key ways.</p> \n<h3>Pharmacies will help manage customers' health</h3> \n<p><img src=""http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/679446/150763404.0.jpg"" class=""small"" alt=""cigarettes ""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">(Ulrich Baumgarten / Getty News Images)</p> \n<p><span>Pharmacies are typically where you go to pick up a prescription. The interaction is brief: give a name, date of birth, sign a form and walk out of the store, pill bottle in hand.</span></p> \n<p>But that's not  the future of pharmacies, at least how CVS sees it. They see that interaction as a huge, untapped opportunity to win contracts with hospitals and doctor offices aiming to cut spending.</p> \n<p>Pharmacists arguably have the most interaction with patients; think of how many times you pick up a prescription versus your regular trips to the doctor. <span>And that could put pharmacists in the position to help hospitals and doctors make sure that their patients are staying on track with their treatment — and, if all goes as planned, help prevent repeat trips back to the emergency room.</span></p> \n<p>This is especially important at this particular moment, when a growing number of hospitals are getting into ""<a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/post/health-reform-at-2-why-american-health-care-will-never-be-the-same/2012/03/22/gIQA7ssUVS_blog.html"">global budget</a>"" contracts. These are deals where, in their simplest form, an insurance company gives the hospital chain a lump sum of money to care for their patients. If the hospital can provide care for less, they typically net a profit — hence the importance of keeping patients healthy.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""center"">hospitals want to cut health costs — and think pharmacies can help</q></p> \n<p>All of a sudden, the pharmacist can become a key ally in trying to stay within that global budget.</p> \n<p>You can see this strategy playing out with the deals that CVS has recently inked. Here in the D.C. area, for example, the chain announced last month a partnership with hospital chain MedStar. The two companies will share data through electronic medical records. CVS will know, for example, whether a MedStar patient has picked up a prescription they received at the hospital — and if not, can call them with a reminder.</p> \n<p>Trying to counsel patients into healthier behaviors — quitting smoking, let's say — wasn't something CVS felt they could credibly do while also selling those same patients cigarettes. So they quit tobacco sales, and made a big bet that the long-run way to do better.</p> \n<h3>2) Pharmacies will become health care providers themselves</h3> \n<p><img src=""http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/679442/157566743.0.jpg"" class=""small"" alt=""minute clinic""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">A nurse practitioner delivers a flu vaccine in a Miami Minute Clinic (Joe Raedle / Getty Images News)</p> \n<p>CVS has increasingly made a play into the health care provider space, quickly scaling up its Minute Clinic locations. It now has 880 of these clinics scattered across the United States. These are the walk-in offices next to the pharmacies that provide routine care, often during the night and weekend hours that traditional doctor offices aren't open.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""left"">cvs runs more than 800 health care clinics</q></p> \n<p>These type of retail clinics have grown quickly, with companies like Walmart increasingly trying to scale up in this area (Walmart has, in a way, gone even further than CVS, and now provides full physicals for $40 at some locations). The bet here is that patients don't want to deal with long wait-times and difficult-to-schedule appointments. They also want cheaper care. And CVS thinks it can deliver: Minute Clinics don't require appointments and are staffed by nurse practitioners, who generally have lower salaries than physicians.</p> \n<p>The same arguments from above apply here: if CVS' Minute Clinics are trying to help patients quit smoking, it's hard to justify selling them cigarettes a few yards away. If CVS' bets pay off, the lost revenue from cigarettes could eventually be offset by more contracts with health care systems and more visits to their clinics — an ultimate financial win for the company.</p>"

Only 6 percent of doctors are happy with their jobs,http://www.vox.com/2014/9/8/6110839/doctors-low-morale-doctored-sandeep-jauhar,"""Today medicine is just another profession, and doctors have become like everybody else: insecure, discontented and anxious about the future.""","<p><span>There's one story in </span><a href=""http://sandeepjauhar.com/"" style=""font-size: 15.5555562973022px; line-height: 1.5; background-color: #ffffff;"">Sandeep Jauhar</a><span>'s new memior </span><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00IHCC5T2"" style=""font-size: 15.5555562973022px; line-height: 1.5; background-color: #ffffff;""><i>Doctored </i></a><span>that I can't stop thinking about.</span></p> \n<p>Jauhar, a cardiologist in Long Island, writes about a 74-year-old patient named Mildred Harris who was ""frail and virtually bed-bound."" Harris had been referred to him for an examination prior to surgery, by another cardiologist who didn't have admitting privileges at his office. That cardiologist had referred Harris for surgery and needed Jauhar's sign off. But after examining the patient, he decided the procedure was too risky for someone so frail and called the procedure off.</p> \n<p>It happened anyway — mostly because it was good for business. The other cardiologist (the one outside the hospital) had asked the surgeon to go ahead — and the surgeon, who got lots of referrals from that cardiologist, didn't want to tarnish the relationship by declining this one. ""Adelman [the other doctor] sends me a lot of business,"" the surgeon explains to Jauhar. ""I don't want to lose it.""</p> \n<p><q class=""center"" aria-hidden=""true"">""doctors have become like everyone else: insecure, discontent and scared about the future.""</q></p> \n<p>It's scary to think about being that patient; I certainly wouldn't want to have a surgery my doctor thought was unnecessary only to solidify another doctor's financial relationships. It's scary, but also not unique: there are dozens of examples like this in Jauhar's book that he argues are leading to a collective malaise among America's physicians.</p> \n<p>""In the mid-20th century, physicians were the pillars of any community,"" Jauhar recently <a href=""http://online.wsj.com/articles/the-u-s-s-ailing-medical-system-a-doctors-perspective-1409325361"">wrote</a> in the Wall Street Journal last week. ""If you were smart and sincere and ambitious, at the top of your class, there was nothing nobler or more rewarding that you could aspire to become.</p> \n<p>""Today, medicine is just another profession, and doctors have become like everybody else: insecure, discontented and anxious about the future.""</p> \n<p>Jauhar and I spoke Friday about why American doctors are frustrated, what role their salaries play, and whether Obamacare can alleviate some of the problems. What follows is a transcript of our discussion, lightly edited for clarity and length.</p> \n<p><b>Sarah Kliff: One of the most impactful statistics you cite in your book is that only 6 percent of physicians say they have positive morale. Do you think that's different from other time periods and, if so, why?</b></p> \n<p>Sandeep Jauhar: Satisfaction in medicine has probably been somewhat variable and even cyclical. I think we happen to be at a very low point right now. If you look back in the 19th century, there were moments when dissatisfaction was very high. People were unhappy with doctors, and their business was being cut into by quacks peddling snake oil.</p> \n<p>American medicine went through a hallowed period in the 1950s. Doctors were not only incredibly well-respected but there were so many tangible improvements in medicine with the advent of technological innovations like coronary bypass surgery.</p> \n<p>In the Wall Street Journal, I trace some of what you're seeing now back to the advent of Medicare. Medicare didn't end up cutting into doctors' income; their income actually skyrocketed. But that lead to a backlash against fee-for-service, and that lead to managed care. And that led to all the restrictions we have now on doctor's autonomy.</p> \n<p><b>SK: This was something that jumped out at me right away in the book, that you almost seemed a bit nostalgic for the world of fee-for-service medicine, where doctors got paid for each service. But in the health care world, there's a lot of thinking that this is a terrible way to pay doctors, because it encourages unnecessary care.</b></p> \n<p>SJ: It was nostalgic in the sense physicians were undoubtedly happier in that era. <span>There were also, obviously, a lot of downsides to that way of practice. There wasn't as much evidence-based medicine, and there weren't the technological innovations that we have now. Also, the vast majority of patients were not insured.</span></p> \n<p>You can't go back to that model. Health care is too expensive today, and you have to have insurance. But I think that today, patients are suffering from different problems, equal or greater in scope. Now, they're benefiting from the pacemakers and defibrillators and stents, but they have chronic illnesses handled by a team of physicians that don't  coordinate their care. This has created a highly fragmented environment.</p> \n<p>One of the things I always get asked by my patients is, are you going to talk to my other doctor? Because a lot of time you have specialists for each body part, but they're not talking to each other.</p> \n<p><b>SK: One of the parts of your book I found most disturbing is about how referrals work. Your experience seems to suggest that referrals are a lot about money and relationships, and that a lot of follow-up care and tests are unnecessary. Why do doctors accept referrals for procedures that they don't think are necessary?</b></p> \n<p>SJ: There's an etiquette. If someone asks you to see a patient, and you refuse, you're never going to get a referral again. Your business could dry up. I'm not under nearly as much pressure as an interventional cardiologist [who does surgeries]. What are you supposed to do when you feel like the patient doesn't need the care? It's a conflict that has to get resolved, and sometimes the physician who is being referred to just acquiesces.</p> \n<p><b>SK: The case that jumped out at me in your book the most was the old woman who you didn't think should have surgery, but she did anyway, mostly because another cardiologist seemed worried about losing out on the surgeon's business. It's a scary situation to think about as a patient.</b></p> \n<p>SJ: It is scary. That case did have a discretionary element. I wasn't 100 percent sure I was right and that the surgeon was wrong. I, as a cardiologist, was saying, we shouldn't do anything, but we ended up doing it. She did end up fine with the surgery, in the end.</p> \n<p>Would she have done the same, or better, without the surgery? We don't know. That's another thing about medicine. So much of it is discretionary now. We don't have strong evidence in many situations about the right way to do things, and you can argue it either way.</p> \n<p><b>SK: One of the things you write about in your book is the financial pressures that doctors face, and how it's not a cushy profession. </b></p> \n<p><b>When I was reading that part, I couldn't help but think of a study I'd seen earlier this summer, showing that</b><a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/6/23/5834320/nine-of-americas-ten-top-paid-jobs-are-doctors""> nine of the top paying professions </a><b>in the US are all in health care. So I'm curious how you reconcile those two things, the type of financial pressures that you describe facing and the fact that doctors do earn more than pretty much any other profession?<br></b></p> \n<p>SJ: I think that income is a small part of doctors' woes. Theres no question that doctors earn healthy incomes. What they have to do to earn that income is often appalling. To earn a $150,000 to $200,000 salary, which is a healthy salary that primary-care doctors make, you have to run on a treadmill. You're seeing 25 to 30 patients a day.</p> \n<p><q class=""center"" aria-hidden=""true"">""If someone asks you to see a patient, and you refuse, you're never going to get a REFERRAL again.""</q></p> \n<p>These figures don't include the educational debt that some of my colleagues have, which can be nearly $500,000. The amount of pressure and risk that you take seeing patients for eight to 10 minutes per session, the educational debt, the fear of getting sued, all of that has created a climate of dissatisfaction.</p> \n<p><span>I agree with you that doctors generally make healthy incomes. They certainly make more than European doctors, but European doctors don't have all the educational debt, and they don't work as hard. I've had friends go abroad, and they talk about taking hour-and-a-half lunches. They don't do that here.</span></p> \n<p><b>SK: This might be a really simple question but, why not? It sounds like if doctors worked less, they would earn less, but be more satisfied with their profession.</b></p> \n<p>SJ: That's what I'm doing. I decided to take a salaried position, because I didn't want to compromise my ideals.  There was a time in my life when, with debt and with a new family, I just couldn't make ends meet.</p> \n<p>You can argue why can't you make ends meet with your salary? I couldn't, and I had to look for a second job [moonlighting on nights and weekends in a private cardiology practice]. I personally think that the way out of this mess is to focus less on money, less on the bankers making millions, and really focus on our professional ideals. I personally think that doctors would be happier on salary.</p> \n<p><b>SK: Are you optimistic that things will move in this direction? Or that the treadmill will just speed up, and force doctors to see even more patients in shorter time periods?</b></p> \n<p>SJ: <span>I'm optimistic. Like with my own personal crisis, I had to hit rock bottom that got me out of the mess. That is a metaphor for medicine. I think we're at the low point. </span></p> \n<p><span>I'm surprised that I've had a lot of colleagues who applauded the book, who have stopped me in the hallway and said, ""You wrote exactly what I'm thinking."" The book paints a system that is really bleak and broken. When you get into a highly broken state, things can only improve. And my hope is people will read it and understand some of the drivers of disease in the system. </span></p>"
Instagram for doctors: How one app is solving medical mysteries,http://www.vox.com/2014/9/7/6111685/instagram-for-doctors-figure-1-app,"The ""corridor consult"" has gone digital, with thousands of doctors sharing medical images online â€” and helping one another make diagnoses.","<p><span>A family-medicine doctor recent saw a 13-year-old with a weird, unidentifiable rash. It wasn't itchy or painful, and the teenage boy hadn't traveled anywhere recently. So the the doctor did what any modern physician would do: he took a photo and uploaded it to an Instagram-style app called Figure 1. </span></p> \n<p><chorus-asset data-id=""687666"" class=""chorus-snippet browser_wide_media""> <img src=""http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/687666/IMG_2278.0.jpg"" class=""small"" alt=""figure1""> </chorus-asset></p> \n<p class=""caption"">(Figure 1)</p> \n<p>""13 y/o M with rash on his knee for 2 months,"" the doctor with the username inder70 wrote. ""it is not itchy, no pain, no travel, no new food no inciting agent, no medications?""</p> \n<p>The suggestions came piling in. One doctor asked if it was fungal (""no itchiness or raised border,"" inder70 responded). Most of them quickly landed on the same diagnosis: granuloma annulare, a skin condition that has no known cause and can be treated with certain ointments. ""Thanks everyone!!"" inder70 responded, the medical mystery solved.</p> \n<h3>Hospital hallway conversations, gone digital</h3> \n<p>Figure 1 is the brainchild of Josh Landy, an internist from Toronto. He did his residency at Stanford and saw constant, off-the-cuff consults happening in hospital hallways, where doctors would try and talk through the details of a case that was surprising or new to them.</p> \n<p>""It can be 4 a.m. when you're working, and you're going to see something that can astonish you,"" Landy said. ""It might be the most classic textbook example of something you don't know about, and it happens when there are not a lot of other people around. So the idea was there has to be a better way to communicate.""</p> \n<p>Landy started doing research on his fellow residents and found that <a href=""https://mail.google.com/mail/u/1/#search/landy/14837a83fddd0555?projector=1"">13 percent </a>were already using their smart phones to share images with one another via email or text message. What if there was a wider network to share those images and get more input from not just one hospital's residents, but the wider medical community?</p> \n<p><q class=""center"" aria-hidden=""true"">""it can be 4 a.m. when you're working and you can see something that astonishes you""</q></p> \n<p>That's where Figure 1 comes in: since its launch in the spring of 2013, the app has accrued 115,000 users. It's most popular, unsurprisingly, among young doctors: an estimated 20 percent of medical residents now have Figure 1 on their phones. There are sections on dermatology (lots of rashes), radiology (mostly x-rays), and emergency medicine (<i>not </i>for the faint of heart).</p> \n<p>Not all of these users are doctors: Landy estimates that about 10 percent of the users are non-health care professionals (people like me, which explains how I was able to see that image and discussion above). Only doctors, however, can comment on cases — and they do, a lot.</p> \n<p>Some of the doctors are sharing images they find interesting: ""Kitchen knife vs. thumb. Pretty minor but I've never seen someone stitch through a nail like this!"" one doctor wrote under a photo that, as you can imagine, is a thumbnail with stitches. But a lot of the app is doctors seeking advice and asking other professionals to give their opinions on cases.</p> \n<p>For example, a radiologist recently asked others to look at an x-ray of an elderly woman who ""fell backward onto the floor."" A registered nurse posted a photo of the phlegm her patient had coughed up (""Any idea what this may be??""); another shared a photo of a patient's urine that elicited a 77-comment chain discussing the diagnosis.</p> \n<h3>Privacy, diagnosis issues raised</h3> \n<p><span>One of the persistent questions about an app like Figure 1 is privacy. Few patients would want their faces to turn up in the public forum. Landy said the approach to protecting privacy is twofold: doctors are required to ask permission to take a photograph, and they can't capture any identifying details. That explains why you see a lot of limbs on Figure 1, but no faces.</span></p> \n<p>The issue I was interested was whether Figure 1 raised issues of liability. If another user suggested a diagnosis — and the doctor posting the photo followed through — could that put the commenting user at potential fault for something going wrong? It's easy to see a patient, in the future, going back to Figure 1 to trace the comment thread that may have contributed to her treatment.</p> \n<p>Landy said this wasn't an issue that had come up much yet in Figure 1's short lifetime and that these interactions were arguably just another version of the corridor consults that already happen. <span>""These are people who are talking about a lot of the cases because they're interesting, textbook, classic versions and they can help,"" he said.</span></p>"
A Constant Battle,http://www.vox.com/2014/8/21/6031771/mississippi-abortion-clinic-doctor-willie-parker,"When youâ€™re the only clinic, thatâ€™s a constant battle,"" abortion provider Willie Parker says.

Two keep their identities private: legal documents only refer to them as ""Drs. Roe and Doe."" This anonymity is not atypical for abortion providers, who often face   harassment  and threats of violence. Eight abortion providers have been murdered in the past two decades, and another 17 have been victims of attempted murders. The third doctor who provides abortions in Mississippi is Willie Parker.</p> \n<p><!--  ########  BEGIN SNIPPET  ########  --></p> \n<div class=""chorus-snippet""> \n<p><toggles class=""hide-on-external-post"">story,interview</toggles></p> \n<story> \n<p>""I've not been unwilling to make it known that I've delivered babies,"" Parker told me last week, as he drove through the backroads of Alabama. ""And I'm not unwilling to make it known that I perform abortions.""</p> \n<p>Parker is a rarity — not only because he provides abortions in the Deep South, but because he is so public about his work. He was recently the subject of a lengthy Esquire magazine profile titled, ""<a href=""http://www.esquire.com/features/abortion-ministry-of-dr-willie-parker-0914"">The abortion ministry of Dr. Willie Parker</a>."" He has conducted dozens of interviews, which he said he sees as a form of advocacy.</p> \n<p>For years, Parker worked in urban areas of the country, places like Chicago and Washington, DC, providing abortions in areas of the country where the practice was largely uncontroversial. But last month, he moved back to his home state of Alabama with the express purpose of providing abortions in hostile territory — and leading the fight to keep Mississippi's one clinic, the Jackson Women's Health Organization, open.</p> \n<p>""It was … a conscious decision to make myself more available to provide care in the region where access has been greatly limited by the political climate,"" Parker said. ""It became important to me to make sure these services are available in the region of the county where I come from.""</p> \n<h3>""Abortion access has changed dramatically""</h3> \n<p>The South has become increasingly anti-abortion.

""The debate at the federal level affected what happened at the state level, and accessing abortion is much more difficult in 2014 than it was in 2009.""</p> \n<p>The drop in public support for abortion has coincided with a wave of new restrictions on abortion in the two states where Parker practices, Alabama and Mississippi.</p> \n<p>Mississippi, for example has passed in the past four years at least five laws restricting abortion access. The state has prohibited plans sold on Obamacare's health insurance exchange from covering abortion in nearly all situations. It has <a href=""http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2013/07/starting-this-week-its-harder-to-get-an-abortion-in-5-states/"">banned</a> telemedicine prescriptions of RU-486, the pill that causes abortions.         And in 2012, Mississippi Gov. Phil Bryant signed House Bill 1390 — the one that now threatens to shut down the clinic where Parker works.</p> \n<p>On April 16, 2012, the day Bryant signed the bill, he described it as a ""historic"" moment.   ""Today,"" Bryant said, ""you see the first step in a movement, I believe, to do what we campaigned on to say we're going to try and end abortion in Mississippi.""</p> \n<p>It's Parker's fight  to stop that from happening.</p> \n<h3>""I don't carry a gun<span>, but I'm prepared to defend myself""</span> \n</h3> \n<div class=""align-right""> \n<p><chorus-asset data-id=""663680""> <img src=""http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/663680/ParkerRT2013.0.jpg"" class=""small"" alt=""willie parker""> </chorus-asset></p> \n<div class=""align-right""> \n<p class=""caption"">Willie Parker speaking at a recent event (Brett Deutsch)</p> \n</div> \n</div> \n<p>Parker didn't always plan to become an abortion provider. About a decade ago, he was a mid-career OB-GYN with a plum position teaching at the University of Hawaii. He had long been a supporter of abortion rights, but only began thinking about doing the procedure himself when a university administrator started talking about banning abortions on campus.         He began thinking about a Martin Luther King Jr.'s last sermon, ""<a href=""http://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/mlkivebeentothemountaintop.htm"">I've Been to the Mountain Top</a>,"" that considers the parable of the Good Samaritan and what makes him good.</p> \n<p>""In it, he talks about a fallen traveler who is in need of help, and most passersby would go by, concerned with what would happen to themselves,"" Parker recounted.</p> \n<p>""What the Good Samaritan does is reverse the question and think about what would happen to that man,"" he continued. ""I began to ask myself, what would happen to these women when I can't or won't help them? And that's how I made a decision to add abortion services to my practice.""</p> \n<p>Parker began providing abortion services in large urban areas, first Washington, DC, and then Chicago. He applied for a license to become an abortion provider in Mississippi near the end of 2011, so he could start flying down twice a month and work in a Jackson clinic.</p> \n<p>He said he faces some harassment in this line of work, but nothing that would deter him from practicing.         ""I'm mindful of my circumstances,"" he said. ""I lock my car. I have contact with law enforcement, in terms of reaching out if I need to. I don't carry a gun, but I'm prepared to defend myself.""</p> \n<p>Parker received his license in May 2012. That was one month after Gov. Bryant signed the admitting privilege law he hoped would ""end abortion in Mississippi"" — and two months before it went into effect.</p> \n<h3>""We haven't been successful at all so far""</h3> \n<p>Mississippi is among nine states that, since 2011, have passed laws requiring abortion providers to have admitting privileges at a local hospital. While these laws are not new, they have recently become more common.</p> \n<p><chorus-asset data-id=""652790""> <img src=""http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/assets/4887186/admitting_privileges.png"" class=""small"" alt=""admitting privilege chart""> </chorus-asset></p> \n<p>Three of these laws — in North Dakota, Tennessee, and Texas — are currently in effect. In those states, any abortion provider must now have admitting privileges at a nearby hospital.</p> \n<p>Four states — Alabama, Kansas, Louisiana, and Mississippi — have laws that are on hold pending the outcome of court decisions. The other two laws, in Louisiana and Oklahoma, were just passed this spring and are still in planning stages.</p> \n<q class=""left"" aria-hidden=""true""><span class=""q__inner"">Seven hospitals turned down Parker's request for admitting privileges. </span></q> \n<p>These laws have become the center of fierce court battles. Parker is a plaintiff in the fight against the Mississippi law. He went to seven hospitals seeking admitting privileges after the law passed. He was turned down everywhere.</p> \n<p>""Some of them did not return our request for an application, some of them sent an application,"" Parker said. ""The ones that responded told us we weren't eligible for staff membership and then some just didn't give us any feedback at all. We haven't been successful so far.""</p> \n<p>Without admitting privileges, Parker couldn't practice under Mississippi law. So he's been fighting the law in court — and winning. In July, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals found the restriction to be an unconstitutional violation of abortion rights that placed ""a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion in Mississippi.""</p> \n<p>The Fifth Circuit's ruling put the admitting privilege law on hold, meaning Parker could keep running his practice.</p> \n<p>But the decision is not the final word: another panel ruled in favor of a very similar law in Texas. Observers expect that, with the split opinions, the case will likely head to the Supreme Court.</p> \n<p>""I think the Supreme Court has to decide this,"" said Caitlin Borgmann, a law professor at the City University of New York who has written extensively on abortion law. ""The lower courts are conflicted over at least three separate issues: how to evaluate undue burdens, what counts as a state's compelling interest, and whether access to abortion outside state borders matters.""</p> \n<h3>""It's hard to move forward""</h3> \n<p>Even though the law is currently on hold, Parker said it still has a palpable impact on his clinic. It's difficult, for example, to recruit other providers to the state when the legality of abortion remains in such flux.</p> \n<p>""It's hard to move forward, because we're trying to make sure we can fight off this lawsuit and keep the clinic open,"" he said.</p> \n<p>The Jackson Women Health Organization's place as Mississippi's only abortion clinic seems to draw opponents. On days when there are hearings on the lawsuit, the clinic tends to get more protesters.</p> \n<q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""center"">""We're trying to make sure we can fight off this lawsuit and keep the clinic open""</q> \n<p>""A couple of weeks ago there was a major caravan from Birmingham to Jackson to Nashville when I was working in Jackson,"" Parker said. ""So that was a couple of busloads of students who, for two to three days, essentially laid siege to the clinic. But there's a consistent group of locals we have, too.""</p> \n<p>I asked Parker whether he has days where he thinks about throwing in the towel — if not giving up on abortion practice, at least doing so in a more supportive community, somewhere like the places he used to work.  He said he doesn't.</p> \n<p>""When I'm tempted to feel like I'm really tapped out, I look at the women in the clinic and what they go through,"" Parker said. ""They have the waiting period, trying to raise the money, arrange transportation, arrange childcare.</p> \n<p>""For me, if those women can go through that, it's energizing to make sure somebody can help them.""</p> \n</story> <interview> \n<div class=""question""> \n<p><i class=""name"">Sarah Kliff: </i>How and when did you decide to become an abortion provider?</p> \n</div> \n<div class=""answer""> \n<p><i class=""name"">Willie Parker:</i> At the time that I made the decision, I was in the middle of my career as an OB-GYN. I was at the University of Hawaii and had always been supportive of a woman’s right to choose, but I’d been wrestling with what it would mean to provide the procedure.</p> \n<p>I was wrestling with the morality of it, and my epiphany came when listening a Martin Luther King Jr. sermon, about the parable of the good Samaritan. In it, he talks about the fallen traveler who is in need of help, and most passerby would go by, concerned with what would happen to themselves. What the good Samaritan does is reverse the question and think about what would happen to that man.</p> \n<p>That resonated with me, since I was dealing with women on a regular basis in situations of unplanned pregnancy. And I began to ask myself, what would happen to these women when I can’t or won’t help them? That’s how I made a decision to add abortion services to my practice.</p> \n</div> \n<div class=""question""> \n<p><i class=""name"">Sarah Kliff:</i> Was it scary to get into abortion practice? This was a particular moment when there was a decent amount of violence against abortion providers, including a few murders in the decade prior.</p> \n<div class=""answer""> \n<p><i class=""name"">Willie Parker: </i>I did wrestle with it for years, so I was well aware of the violence at the time. But I can honestly say I was focused more on the rightness in providing the services. I was aware of the violence, but it didn’t factor into my decision. I just assumed that’s a risk, but in the way that doing anything meaningful has risks. You just focus on what’s the right thing.</p> \n</div> \n<div class=""question""> \n<p><i class=""name""> Sarah Kliff:</i>You’ve worked in larger urban areas like Washington and Chicago. For awhile, you flew back from those places to work in Alabama. How did you decide to recently move to Alabama, and work in a clinic there and in Mississippi?</p> \n</div> \n<div class=""answer""> \n<p><i class=""name""> Willie Parker: </i>It was a combination of things. I have a younger brother facing some serious health challenges. So it was partly a decision to move home to be near him to assist in his efforts to get healthy. It was also a conscious decision to make myself more available to provide care in the region where access has been greatly limited by the political climate. It became important to me to make sure these services are available in the region of the county where I come from. It’s a bit of a regional loyalty. I prioritize making sure that services are available to all women.</p> \n</div> \n<div class=""question""> \n<p><i class=""name"">Sarah Kliff: </i>Can you tell me a bit about the women that you see in your clinics in Alabama and Mississippi? How far are they traveling, and what kind of circumstances they are in?</p> \n</div> \n<div class=""answer""> \n<p><i class=""name""> Willie Parker: </i>I would say they are representative of the demographics of abortion all over. We know women of color and Latino women have the highest rate of abortions. The women who come to these clinics are mostly black women and women of color. Most of them live at or below the poverty level, but I also see lawyers and doctors sprinkled in as well.     In Alabama we have three clinics. In Mississippi there’s one. Women drive from all over the state. There is a Planned Parenthood clinic in Mobile, and then one in Montgomery that serves the whole southern region of the state. There was a clinic in Birmingham, but that one closed about two years ago.</p> \n</div> \n<div class=""question""> \n<p><i class=""name"">Sarah Kliff: </i>Why are there so few abortion clinics in the areas you work?</p> \n<div class=""answer""> \n<p><i class=""name"">Willie Parker: </i>I think it's a combination of things. There’s abuse of regulatory authority and a lot of difficulties under which clinics have to operate. Clinics have to put a lot of resources into defending themselves here. When you’re the only clinic, that’s a constant battle.   From the standpoint of providers, some are intimidated out of practice. There was one doctor who met me at the clinic in Montgomery, and somehow her application to work there was published with her home phone number. She was driven out of the community with harassment and public shaming and stigma. In Mississippi, there are people who are sympathetic to abortion but it would be a small part of their practice, and they’re not willing to put the rest of their medical practice at risk. So there’s that aspect going on as well.</p> \n</div> \n<div class=""question""> \n<p><i class=""name"">Sarah Kliff: </i> One of the things that has struck me about you is that you have a very public profile, like your recent profile in Esquire. Many of your colleagues are much more private about their work, out of concern about some of the issues you raised. Have you faced any harassment yourself since moving to Alabama?</p> \n<div class=""answer""> \n<p><i class=""name"">Willie Parker: </i> Certainly people say things like, ""You’ve been warned."" I’ve not had any personal confrontation. I try to take common sense measures. My decision not to hide is in part related to the fact I really believe I’m providing healthcare for women. There’s no aspect of my career I’ve been ashamed of. I’ve not been unwilling to make it known I’ve delivered babies, and I’m not unwilling to make it known I perform abortions.  I’m mindful of my circumstances. I lock my car. I have contact with law enforcement, in terms of reaching out if I need to. I am prepared to defend myself. I don’t carry a gun. I don’t talk much publicly about what my measures are, because that would defeat the purpose a bit.</p> \n</div> \n<div class=""question""> \n<p><i class=""name"">Sarah Kliff: </i>In the admitting privileges lawsuit, it says that you and your colleague in Mississippi tried applying for access at seven hospitals in Jackson, MS, and were denied at all of them. Can you describe what that process was like?</p> \n</div> \n<div class=""answer""> \n<p><i class=""name"">Willie Parker: </i> When the law went into effect, we began applying to all the hospitals. Some of them did not return our request for an application, some of them sent an application. The ones that responded told us we weren’t eligible for staff membership and then some just didn’t give us any feedback at all. We haven’t been successful so far.</p> \n</div> \n<div class=""question""> \n<p><i class=""name"">Sarah Kliff: </i>Supporters of the admitting privilege laws argue that this is a common sense measure to protect women’s health in emergency situations where they need additional help. That’s what the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals essentially ruled in Texas. How do you respond to those type of arguments?</p> \n<div class=""answer""> \n<p><i class=""name"">Willie Parker: </i> These laws and these rules pass the common sense test, and that’s why they’re so dangerous. They sound good, but in their substance they don’t add anything to the quality or safety of abortion. They create barriers and deny women access to service. I’m for any safety regulation that is going to make abortion care safe, but, for women, abortion care is already safe.   What really gets me are the targeted regulations that we’re required to meet and others aren’t. It’s unjustified. Abortion is already heavily regulated.</p> \n</div> \n<div class=""question""> \n<p><i class=""name"">Sarah Kliff: </i> Do you have regular protesters at your clinics?</p> \n</div> \n<div class=""answer""> \n<p><i class=""name"">Willie Parker: </i> There are consistent protesters at both clinics, and then there is the targeted revving up of protest activity. The Forty Days for Life campaign, for example, brings a lot of protesters. The same thing when there were hearings regarding the lawsuit, the people in Mississippi would sync their protest activity.   A couple of weeks ago there was a major caravan from Birmingham to Jackson to Nashville when I was working in Jackson. So that was a couple of busloads of students who, for two to three days, essentially laid siege to the clinic. But there’s a consistent group of locals we have, too.</p> \n</div> \n<div class=""question""> \n<p><i class=""name"">Sarah Kliff: </i> Do those protest tactics deter women from getting abortions?</p> \n</div> \n<div class=""answer""> \n<p><i class=""name"">Willie Parker: </i> It absolutely deters women. With all of them, I’ve heard screaming at women, things like ""don’t go in and kill your babies."" It’s psycho-terrorism. When they’re not successful, upon the woman’s exit they’ll say things like, ""How does it feel to have just killed your baby?"" It absolutely serves as a deterrent.</p> \n</div> \n<div class=""question""> \n<p><i class=""name"">Sarah Kliff: </i>Are you thinking about how to get more abortion providers to work in the South?</p> \n</div> \n<div class=""answer""> \n<p><i class=""name"">Willie Parker: </i>We’re constantly thinking about that. I do have one colleague who came down to see what it was like and really had a sense of purpose about wanting to come and assist. But right now it's hard to move forward, because we’re trying to make sure we can fight off this lawsuit and keep the clinic open.</p> \n</div> \n<p>I’m a plaintiff in the lawsuit, and have operated with good faith that we’ll stay open, so we’re constantly thinking about how we can distribute this resource. Right now, because of the climate, most people feel more comfortable working in larger urban areas.</p> \n<p>We’re trying to figure out ways to get people to see the disparities. In some ways, it's easier to go to another country and provide care than it is to come here. I wish people would see the abject poverty, and we’re actively trying to get people to do that.</p> \n</div> \n<div class=""question""> \n<p><i class=""name"">Sarah Kliff: </i>You’re obviously facing a lot of challenges in the work that you do right now, particularly with the lawsuit, and with working in Mississippi’s only abortion clinic. Do you ever think about switching back to an OB-GYN practice that doesn’t involve abortion?</p> \n</div> \n<div class=""answer""> \n<p><i class=""name"">Willie Parker: </i>I’m fortunate I feel sustained by the work I do and the fact that I’m making what I know to be a big difference in the lives of women. When I sit across the desk from a woman in Mississippi and she’s at the only clinic in the state providing abortion services, I know I’m making a difference.  I don’t get distracted by feeling like we’re always fighting.</p> \n<p>When I’m tempted to feel like I’m really tapped out, I look at the women in the clinic and what they go through. They have the waiting period, trying to raise the money, arrange transportation, arrange childcare. For me, if those women can go through that, it’s energizing to make sure somebody can help them.</p> \n<p>I don’t want to come off as a goody two-shoes, but I’ve been a physician for 24 years and in practice for 20. I can say at this stage in my career that I’m doing my most rewarding work and don’t have any questions about that.</p> \n</div> \n<p><!--  ########  END SNIPPET  ########  --></p> \n<p><br id=""1407255417648""></p> \n</div> \n</div> \n</div> \n</interview> \n</div> \n</div>"
Are men really going to have access to a new contraceptive by 2017?,http://www.vox.com/2014/9/11/6135199/male-contraceptive-birth-control-sex-protection-vasalgel-RISUG,Recent headlines suggested there's a miracle birth control for men coming to a pharmacy near you.,"<p>""Male birth control, without condoms, will be here by 2017,"" the Daily Beast <a href=""http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/09/09/we-ll-have-male-birth-control-by-2017.html"">confidently declared </a>earlier this week. Other <a href=""http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-2750650/First-male-contraceptive-injection-available-THREE-years.html"">outlets</a> picked up on the news. In just a few years, according to the headlines, women will apparently be free from worry about unwanted pregnancy because men will  be able to access an amazingly effective, safe, and reversible  sperm-blocking procedure for birth control.</p> \n<p>If it all sounds too good to be true, there's a reason: it's not actually accurate.</p> \n<p>These stories weren't based on published research findings or a Food and Drug Administration approval notice for <a href=""http://www.parsemusfoundation.org/vasalgel-faqs/"">Vasalgel</a>, a method of birth control that involves injecting a gel into a man's vas deferens — where the sperm flow — so that it stops them from releasing the little swimmers. Vasalgel hasn't even gotten a green light from the FDA for testing in humans, nor does do we have published studies in animals to support its use.</p> \n<p>The news came from a press release — and call for donations! — by <a href=""http://myemail.constantcontact.com/Vasalgel-preclinical-studies-making-great-progress-.html?soid=1109766611768&amp;aid=Wt_qWj4Sr-M"">the foundation </a>behind Vasalgel, highlighting some promising (though again, unpublished, anecdotal findings) from testing on baboons.</p> \n<p>Even if this birth control works for male baboons, there's a whole lot that needs to happen before it hits the market for male humans.</p> \n<h3>What it would take to bring Vasalgel to a bedroom near you<br>\n</h3> \n<p>Since Vasalgel doesn't work on people at the chemical level, it would be regulated as a medical device. Animal testing with medical devices is really important since you don't want to implant them in otherwise healthy people to see how they work. If the FDA thinks animal data are sound, they'd approve the device for testing in humans. <br><br>At that point, the company would need to find and recruit study participants willing to experiment with Vasalgel. First, they'd test the birth-control method in a small number of people to see if it's safe, and then move to a broader population to test its efficacy and safety again.</p> \n<p>With some devices, the process could take only a few months or a year. But a product like Vasalgel is unique: there's no precedent for it, said Alexander Gaffney, a regulatory expert based outside of Washington, DC. And testing in humans to demonstrate that it works would take a long time. <br><br><q class=""center"" aria-hidden=""true"">""There's nothing like this on the market. When a product has never before been tested in humans, the FDA has a lot of questions.""</q></p> \n<p>""If  they're trying to show people don't get pregnant, you can't run a three-month trial,"" he said. ""They'd have to show two or three years of data for agency to say, 'Yes it prevents pregnancy.' They'd also need to show the procedure is able to be reversed (that men can get women pregnant after Vasalgel), which is one of their  claims."" This also, of course, takes time, or at least nine months. <br><br>There's another potential hurdle for this type of birth control: the FDA might have concerns that men will have more unprotected sex, and that the associated risks outweigh the benefits. ""There will be consumer groups who are going to be concerned about negative externalities,"" explained Gaffney. ""There's nothing like this on the market. When you have a product that's never before been tested in humans and there aren't any similar use cases or studies, the FDA has a lot of questions.""</p> \n<p>Drugs take an average of 12 years to reach the market, and the timeline can be similar for medical devices. ""Getting this product to market in three years sounds ambitious,"" Gaffney concluded.</p> \n<h3>Is this new contraceptive a real contender for men?</h3> \n<p>Again, if you read the news about it, you might think so. And according to the <a href=""http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/09/09/we-ll-have-male-birth-control-by-2017.html"">Daily Beast</a>, Vasalgel is already en route to reducing unintended pregnancies around the world.</p> \n<p>This kind of imagination is good for fiction writing but shouldn't be allowed in health journalism. <br><br>When I called a bunch of experts in reproductive and contraceptives research from across the US, they all had either never heard of Vasalgel or said that it was so far away from hitting the market that it wasn't yet a serious contender. <br><br>As <a href=""http://www.medicine.uiowa.edu/dept_primary_apr.aspx?appointment=Pharmacology&amp;id=ascolim"">Mario Ascoli</a>, a reproductive scientist at the University of Iowa, put it, ""As usual these companies make it sound as if they have discovered the secret of life because they want to entice investors to give them money.""</p> \n<div class=""align-right""> \n<p><chorus-asset class=""chorus-snippet browser_wide_media"" data-id=""693724""> <img alt=""condoms"" class=""small"" src=""http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/693724/90763485.0.jpg""> </chorus-asset></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Condoms: Still a man's only non-surgical birth-control friend.

But the clinical results  are completely lacking. First we'd need more animal studies, then we'd  need need to see them published, and then we can move forward.""</p> \n<p dir=""ltr""><a href=""http://www.kumc.edu/school-of-medicine/molecular-and-integrative-physiology/faculty/faculty/joseph-s-tash-phd.html"">Joseph Tash</a>, of the Kansas University Medical Center, said it's important to keep in mind that the safety bar for contraceptives is even higher than it is for other therapies,  since you're giving otherwise healthy people a medication. So getting a contraceptive approved can take even longer.<br><br>Right now,  he added, the leading contender for a male contraceptive is a hormonal  pill. But no one has figured out yet how to have a success rate anywhere  near similar to the female birth-control pill, which would be the requirement for approval of a male equivalent. <br><br>Plus, it's just hard to ward off sperm, Tash added. ""When you consider how  many sperm are being produced by a male, we're talking millions each day. A female only produces one or two eggs a month. On a  pure numbers basis it is a daunting task.""</p> \n<h3>Wishing Vasalgel the best</h3> \n<p>Vasalgel is based on a procedure called RISUG — which stands for Reversible Inhibition of Sperm Under Guidance — that's been in development in India for years. And again, the idea is that a polymer gel is injected into the vas deferens to block sperm, rather then cutting the vas (a vasteomy). <br><br>Vasalgel claims that ""if a man wishes to restore the flow of sperm, whether after months or years, the polymer is flushed out of the vas with another injection."" This would be great news, since vasectomies aren't always reversible and a man's only other alternative right now is condoms.</p> \n<p>But despite the hype about RISUG, when a <a href=""http://www.wired.com/2011/04/ff_vasectomy/all/1"">World Health Organization team </a>went to check it out, they passed on the procedure, saying that it didn't stand up to scientific scrutiny. There were concerns about toxicity and whether the treatment lasted over the long term.</p> \n<p>The Parsemus Foundation behind Vasalgel is now trying to pick up where  the Indian scientists failed, and maybe they will succeed. I wish them all the best. I  really do. It's a great concept in that it's non-hormonal and  reversible, and it would finally shift the burden of family planning from women on to men. But unfortunately, right now it  seems it's far from reaching a bedroom near you.</p> \n<p><i>Correction: A previous version of this article described the drug development pathway, instead of the device development pathway. </i></p>"
$1.43 of every $100 in America goes toward hospital administration,http://www.vox.com/2014/9/15/6151861/1-43-of-every-100-in-america-towards-hospital-paperwork,We spend three times as much on hospital paperwork as we do on professional sports,"<p>America spends a lot of money on the paperwork that makes hospitals run— $218 billion per year, to be exact. That works out to 1.43 percent of the entire American economy is spent on hospitals' administrative costs. Of every $100 spent in America, that means $1.43 is going toward the billing specialists and schedulers that make hospitals here work.</p> \n<p>Hospital administration has grown as a percent of the economy over the past decade, from 0.9 percent in 2000 to 1.43 percent in 2012, a <a href=""http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/33/9/1586.full"">new paper </a>in the journal <i>Health Affairs </i>shows.</p> \n<p><img alt=""hospital administration"" class=""small"" src=""http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/696506/F1.large.0.jpg""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">(<a href=""http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/33/9/1586.full"">Health Affairs</a>)</p> \n<p>To put this in a bit of context: America spends twice as much on hospital administration as it does on the entire food budget. For what we pay for hospital paperwork, we could pay for all professional American sports three times over (they had a budget of <a href=""http://www.pwc.com/en_US/us/industry/entertainment-media/publications/assets/pwc-sports-outlook-north-america.pdf"">$61 billion</a> this year, according to PriceWaterhouseCooper).</p> \n<p><chorus-asset data-id=""696520"" class=""chorus-snippet browser_wide_media""><img src=""http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/696520/paperwork.0.png"" class=""small"" alt=""hospital sports""></chorus-asset></p> \n<p>This makes the United States different from most other countries. In 11 countries that this <i>Health Affairs </i>article looked at, hospitals usually put about 12 percent of their budget toward administrative activities. But in the United States, hospitals spend a full quarter of their funds on filing the necessary paperwork to make sure that surgeries happen and patients get scheduled.</p> \n<p>This reflects something particular about the American health care system — namely, it's a complex mess. Most other countries have some central agency that sets a national price for every procedure, from a heart transplant to an MRI. But that's not how the United States works. Here, we have thousands of health insurance companies that each negotiate their own prices. For a hospital contracting with a dozen health plans — each charging a different price for an MRI, and anything else — that necessitates a whole bunch of paperwork.</p> \n<p>There are, of course, trade-offs with a system like this. If the government sets the price too low — pays less, for example, for an MRI than hospitals would accept — that could restrict access to needed medicine. In that case, patients have little mode of recourse; they can't switch to another plan, because there's only one game in town.</p> \n<p>You can learn more about how that system works, and its trade-offs, in the video below.

New research shows obesity rates may not be levelingÂ off,http://www.vox.com/2014/9/16/6152443/our-waistlines-are-expanding-BMI-casts-doubt-obesity-rate,Some racial groups gained nearly five inches around their waists in the last few years.,"<p>In recent years, the overall rate of obesity in the US has <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/9/5/6109679/Seven-charts-that-explain-americas-obesity-problem-US"">plateaued</a>. But <a href=""http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?doi=10.1001/jama.2014.8362"">new data</a> published in JAMA shows that Americans' waistlines may be expanding anyway.<b> </b></p> \n<p>Researchers looked at waist circumference measurements taken from over 32,000 adults in 1999 and 2012. During that period, participants' waists grew nearly a whole pants size, from 37.6 inches to 38.8 inches.</p> \n<p>Some groups gained an even more significant amount of abdominal girth. White women, aged 40 to 49, experienced a 2.6-inch expansion; the waists of black men, aged 30 to 39, got padded with 3.2 extra inches; Mexican-American men, aged 20 to 29, added 3.4 inches to their frames; Mexican-American women over the age of 70 packed on 4.4 inches; and black women between the ages of 30 to 39 increased their waists by 4.6 inches. (Abdominal obesity was defined as a waist circumference greater than 40  inches in men and 35 inches in women.)</p> \n<p>That <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/9/5/6109679/Seven-charts-that-explain-americas-obesity-problem-US"">racial minorities</a> are experiencing greater gains maps on to the fact that they're also disproportionately struggling with obesity compared to white people in the US.</p> \n<h3>What does this new research mean?</h3> \n<p>There's a debate in the research community about whether waist  circumference or BMI is the better measure of overweight or obesity. The  most common  measure of obesity is still <a href=""http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/obesity-prevention-source/obesity-definition/obesity-definition-full-story/"">body mass index</a>, which is calculated by dividing weight in kilograms by the square of height in meters (or using this <a href=""https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/guidelines/obesity/BMI/bmicalc.htm"">online calculator</a>). Even though BMI can characterize very muscular people (and <a href=""http://www.suntimes.com/lifestyles/health/9059687-423/chicago-filmmaker-takes-on-diet-industry-in-new-documentary.html"">movie stars</a>) as obese, researchers keep using it because it's less error-prone than taking a tape measure to someone's waist and potentially measuring the wrong part of their belly.</p> \n<p>Still, <a href=""http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/10054519/Waist-to-height-ratio-more-accurate-than-BMI.html"">some argue</a> waist circumference would give a truer measure of obesity. And proponents of the metric, such as Dr. Earl Ford of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and an author on the study, noted that the new research could mean obesity rates aren't actually plateauing at all.</p> \n<p>""The data about obesity in the US, and many countries, has relied  mostly on body mass index to characterize obesity,"" Ford said. According to BMI measures, obesity has leveled  off. But Ford and others have been looking at  waist circumference, a different way to characterize obesity, and they've found another story.</p> \n<p>Particularly concerning, he added, is that women's  waist circumferences seemed to increase for every two-year period the researchers looked at. ""There seems to be a divergence between men and women,"" he said. But again, the researchers aren't sure why.</p> \n<p>Even if the waistline hypothesis turns out to be a less accurate reflection of the state of our bodies than BMI, Ford said that obesity ""is still a  serious problem in the US and people need to pay attention to diet and physical activity.""</p> \n<h3>So how do you know if your waist is an unhealthy size?</h3> \n<p>The size of your waistline is a key health  indicator and larger bellies are linked to an increased risk  cardiovascular disease, Type 2 diabetes, colorectal cancer, and premature  death.</p> \n<p>To figure out whether you're at a healthy size, you just need a measuring tape. According to the <a href=""http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-living/womens-health/in-depth/belly-fat/art-20045809?pg=2"">Mayo Clinic</a>, you want to measure around your bare stomach, just above your hipbone, while relaxing your belly. For women, a waist measure of 35 inches or more is concerning, and for men, it's 40 inches.</p>"

Why officials will be using Yelp reviews to track food-poisoning outbreaks,http://www.vox.com/2014/9/16/6207173/why-officials-will-be-using-yelp-reviews-to-track-food-poisoning,Yelp appears to be a remarkably accurate repository of restaurant food-poisoning incidences.,"<p>You log into your Yelp account after dining at a new restaurant. But instead of scribbling down your thoughts about the flavours of the beef carpaccio or pasta alle vongole, you record when and how the dishes made you sick.</p> \n<p>Your griping, it turns out, can play an important public health role: researchers in Boston are now using Yelp to monitor food poisoning outbreaks.<b> </b></p> \n<p><b></b><span>Looking at posts from about 5,824 food-service businesses across the US, </span>researchers in the Boston Children's Hospital's Informatics Program<span> extracted reviews that described food poisoning to find out which ingredients made people sick and whether they mapped on to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Foodborne Outbreak Online Database (FOOD) of health department reports.</span></p> \n<p>Their findings? ""Ten percent of  all reports on Yelp are food-borne  poisoning related, which is worrying but  useful,"" said one of the  study's authors, John Brownstein who also co-founded the epidemic  tracking tool <a href=""http://www.healthmap.org/?utm_campaign=Q4%202014%20Innovation%20Social&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=vector&amp;utm_content=Vector%20Yelp%20Food%20Poisoning"">HealthMap.</a> What's more, when the researchers compared which foods were implicated on Yelp to the CDC data — they found that they mostly matched.</p> \n<h3>The same foods made people sick in the Yelp and CDC surveillance</h3> \n<p>In a <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=25124281"">new study</a> in the journal Preventive Medicine, the researchers reported that 32 percent of Yelp users complained about poultry, while 33 percent of reports in the CDC system had to do with poultry. Sixteen percent of Yelp users had trouble with seafood, while 12 percent of the CDC reports did. Eggs were implicated in 23 percent of the Yelp reviews; the same proportion in CDC's surveillance system. Overall, at both Yelp and CDC, beef, dairy, grains-beans, poultry, and vine-stalk were the most troublesome food categories.</p> \n<p>At a time when about 48 million Americans have food poisoning every year, this data could be very helpful in mitigating some of that burden, says Brownstein. ""We can use these data for disease prevention and investigation. If someone is saying they had a bad meal at a restaurant, that could have a direct public health response because a public health person could identify the violation, and the food that made someone sick, and investigate.""</p> \n<p>Brownstein's group is already developing a database that will aggregate Tweets with the Yelp information and feed it into an interface that public health agencies across the US can use. It'd support the social-media tracking efforts major US cities — such as <a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6320a1.htm?s_cid=mm6320a1_w"">New York </a>and <a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6332a1.htm?s_cid=mm6332a1_w"">Chicago </a>— have been experimenting with already.

""An inspector from public health may show up to look into what's happening  but they're not going to shut the restaurant down on a false report."" Plus, he added, ""We're going to have to be very careful about monitoring the system. Beyond false reporting, we want to make sure we're providing public health with something useful.""</p>"
"Why Obama is committing 3,000 troops to fight Ebola",http://www.vox.com/2014/9/16/6219061/white-house-committs-3000-troops-to-fight-ebola,The administration has asked Congress for another $88 million to help stop the epidemic.,"<p>As the worst-ever Ebola epidemic rages on in Africa, President Barack Obama announced Tuesday that the US will ramp up efforts to combat the the virus as part of ""the largest international response in the history of the CDC.""</p> \n<p>In an <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSdf9UZax1o"">address</a> from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention headquarters in Atlanta, Obama said that the US is willing to take the lead on international efforts to combat the virus. Ebola ""is a global threat, and it demands a truly global response,"" <a href=""http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/09/16/obama-ebola-atlanta-centers-for-disease-control/15691299/"">Obama said</a>.</p> \n<p>""This is an epidemic that is not just a threat to regional security.  It's a potential threat to global security, if these countries break  down, if their economies break down, if people panic,"" he said. ""That has profound  effects on all of us, even if we are not directly contracting the  disease."" This outbreak is already ""spiraling out of control,"" he added.</p> \n<p>The speech came amid increasing criticism that the international community has not responded quickly and boldly enough to what has become the worst Ebola outbreak in history. And Obama's words at the CDC were more alarming and urgent than his <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij90EjI3nQE"">previous comment</a> on Ebola in August, when he emphasized that the disease is one that strikes under-funded health systems.</p> \n<p><q class=""center"" aria-hidden=""true"">""The reality is this epidemic is going to get worse before it gets betteR.""</q></p> \n<p>So far, more than 2,400 people have died this year from Ebola — more than the combined total  of all previous outbreaks since the first recorded in  1976 — and the epidemic has spread to five African nations, including Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Nigeria, and Senegal.</p> \n<p>Experts at a senate hearing on Tuesday said that the actual death toll is much higher, and that without effective actions to stop it, the case load will grow into the hundreds of thousands. More cases, they cautioned, will mean more potential for Ebola spread  beyond Africa.</p> \n<p>""The reality is this epidemic is going to get worse before it gets better, but right now,"" Obama said, ""the world still has an opportunity to save countless lives. Right now the world has a responsibility to act, to step up, to do more.""</p> \n<h3>3,000 troops dedicated to fighting Ebola</h3> \n<p>To turn the outbreak around, the<span> White House has committed more than $175 million to what it's calling a ""top national security priority."" </span></p> \n<p><span>The focus of the funds is stopping spread in West Africa. </span>The US<span> will send more than 3,000 troops to the most affected areas, and set up a joint operation in Monrovia, Liberia — the hardest hit of the five regions  — to coordinate relief efforts. </span></p> \n<p><span>In addition, the plan will boost the number of health workers and health-care centers in the region. The US pledged to build as many as 17 additional Ebola treatment units — with a total of about 1,700 beds — and to help recruit medical personnel to staff them. (Right now, people in Liberia are being turned away from treatment facilities because there is no capacity to care for them.) The Department of Defense also plans to establish a site where up to 500 health care providers can be trained each week.</span><br><br>USAID will also support a program of distributing kits with sanitizers and medical supplies to some  400,000 of the most vulnerable households in Liberia.<br><br>The Obama administration has asked Congress for an additional  $88  million to combat Ebola,  including $30 million to send more relief   workers and lab supplies from  the CDC and $58 million to invest in  the  development of the  experimental Ebola drug ZMapp and two vaccine   candidates.</p> \n<h3>Chances of Ebola spread in the US ""extremely low"" <br>\n</h3> \n<p>Despite the alarm about the situation in Africa, the White House continues to quell worries about Ebola in America. President Obama said the chances of Ebola spreading in the US are ""extremely low.""<br><br>""US health professionals agree it is highly unlikely that we would experience an Ebola outbreak here in the United States, given our robust health care infrastructure and rapid response capabilities,"" reads a <a href=""http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2014/09/16/fact-sheet-us-response-ebola-epidemic-west-africa"">fact sheet</a> from the administration. <br><br>""Nevertheless, we have taken extra measures to prevent the unintentional importation of cases into the United States, and if a patient does make it here, our national health system has the capacity and expertise to quickly detect and contain this disease.""</p> \n<h3>Ebola toll could rise to ""hundreds of thousands of cases""<br>\n</h3> \n<p>At a Tuesday <a href=""http://www.appropriations.senate.gov/news/appropriations-committee-schedule-week-september-15-2014"">Senate hearing</a> on Ebola in West Africa, health officials who have been working on the front line of this epidemic said that if the world doesn't act now, it's only a matter of time before cases start turning up on shores outside of Africa.</p> \n<p>Beth Bell, director of the National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases at the CDC, said that the number of Ebola cases could balloon into the ""hundreds of thousands"" without effective interventions.<br><br>Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said  budget cuts at his agency can be partly to blame for the slow response to the outbreak. The lack of funding ""eroded, in insidious ways, our ability to respond in the way I  and my colleagues would like to respond to these threats."" He also said it's very unlikely that the virus will mutate to become airborne, though he couldn't rule it out given biology's unpredictability.</p> \n<h3>Too little, too late?</h3> \n<p>The American Ebola survivor Kent Brantly, who contracted the virus while working as a medical missionary in Liberia, criticized the ""painfully slow and ineffective"" response to the outbreak, and noted that the international community only seemed to wake up to Ebola in July, after he and his colleague Nancy Writebol got infected.</p> \n<p>""Many have used the analogy of a fire burning out of control to describe  this unprecedented Ebola outbreak. Indeed it is a fire-a fire straight  from the pit of hell,"" he said, with his wife seated next to him.</p> \n<p>""We cannot fool ourselves into thinking that the  vast moat of the Atlantic Ocean will keep the flames away from our  shores."" He called on more investment in Ebola ""to keep entire  nations from being reduced to ashes.""</p> \n<h3>A worst-case scenario</h3> \n<p>Dr. Bell painted a picture of a best and worst case scenario for this outbreak. ""The best case scenario is that over the coming months we're able to effectively isolate and treat Ebola patients, we're able to effectively trace all their contacts to make sure they're all followed for 21 days, we're able to do something about safe burial practices so we don't have bodies in the streets."" Eventually, she said, we'll see the caseload decrease.</p> \n<p><span> </span></p> \n<p>""In the worst case scenario, we continue to see an exponential rise in cases that we're currently seeing. And an important corollary to that is exportation to other countries."" She noted that the outbreak that originated in Guinea in December has already spread to Liberia, Sierra Leone, Nigeria and Senegal.

How much money do we waste on useless health care?,http://www.vox.com/2014/9/18/6251063/health-care-waste-dartmouth-atlas-sheiner,"""It's nice for Dartmouth to say here's a good measure of how much we can save, and nobody has to sacrifice. I don't know how much space for those type of savings actually exists.""","<p><span>Every health economist remembers their first Dartmouth Atlas.</span></p> \n<p>Louise Sheiner got hers in 1998, when she worked at the Federal Reserve. She still has that same copy today — even though it was actually the Fed's property, and she left that job earlier this year for a new post at the Brookings Institution.</p> \n<p>""Nobody has come after me for it, at least not yet,"" Sheiner says.</p> \n<p>It's hard to overstate the importance of the Dartmouth Atlas, a research project begun in the mid-1990s by health-care researchers at (unsurprisingly) Dartmouth College. The 18-year <span>study has shown the incredible variation in American health spending. What Medicare spends on a single patient's hospital care ranges from $5,371 in Utah to $8,937 in Maryland.</span></p> \n<p><q class=""center"" aria-hidden=""true"">The dartmouth atlas suggests the rare POSSIBILITY of a free lunch in health care</q></p> \n<p>Dartmouth Atlas researchers used this variation as the base of an influential argument — one that, among other things, was an inspiration for Obamacare: the people in Maryland aren't sick enough to justify $3,600 more in health care than the people in Utah. Maryland doctors are providing inefficient, wasteful care.</p> \n<p>This raised the rare possibility of a free lunch in health care. By cutting the wasteful spending, America could save money and improve care at the same time.</p> \n<p>Atul Gawande <a href=""http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2009/06/01/the-cost-conundrum"">used</a> research from the Dartmouth Atlas to write his seminal piece on McAllen, Tex., the area of the country with the highest health care spending. The Atlas came up repeatedly during the Obamacare debate as evidence that America could cut costs without hurting care.</p> \n<p>Sheiner has had her copy of the Atlas for more than a decade now. But her newest research argues that big, clunky book she's held onto for years now is wrong.</p> \n<p><span>She thinks that differences in health do explain the variation in spending — a more pessimistic conclusion that suggests doctors can't simply reduce spending by copying high-performers elsewhere. </span></p> \n<p>""It's nice for Dartmouth to say here's a good measure of how much we can save, and nobody has to sacrifice,"" Sheiner told me in an interview. ""But I don't know how much space for those type of savings actually exists.""</p> \n<h3>There is definitely huge variation in health spending</h3> \n<p><span>Here's where Sheiner and the Atlas researchers agree: There is lots of variation in American health care spending. You can see that in the Atlas's many maps, like this one, which shows average Medicare spending in the last two years of a patient's life.</span></p> \n<p><iframe src=""http://www.dartmouthatlas.org/ThematicMap.axd/embed?mapParams=ind%3D23%26ch%3D1%26tf%3D23%26loct%3D3%26extent%3D-14071323.410590487%202305693.8872850095%20-7398676.589409513%206806306.112714991&amp;w=682&amp;h=460&amp;sht=1&amp;shc=1&amp;brand=1"" width=""682"" height=""558"" allowtransparency=""true"" frameborder=""0"" style=""border:none;overflow:hidden""></iframe></p> \n<p>Where Sheiner and the Atlas disagree is <i>why </i> spending varies so much.</p> \n<p>The Dartmouth Atlas argues it's largely about how doctors practice medicine. Researchers there have spent lots of time looking at individuals' health (how old they are, for example, or whether they have diabetes) and how much Medicare spends on them. They find that differences in health status explain only about 30 percent of the variation in health spending.</p> \n<p>The other 70 percent, they argue, has nothing to do with patients — and everything to do with how doctors provide medicine. <span> </span><span>Some doctors decide to provide lots of medicine that isn't supported by research. They try things, hoping they'll work. Dartmouth describes these physicians as ""cowboy doctors."" </span></p> \n<p>""Cowboy doctors are more likely to do things where there's no clinical basis,"" says Jon Skinner, a health economist at Dartmouth and researcher on the Atlas. ""People are sick everywhere, but in these particular areas, there seems to be a lot more spending. And a lot of it comes down to providers' decisions.""</p> \n<p><span>Sheiner's new working paper for the Brookings Institute argues this is wrong. While Dartmouth uses individual level data, Sheiner does something different. She compares average Medicare spending across an entire state to average health. Here's one of her charts that plots Medicare spending against states' diabetes rates.</span></p> \n<p><chorus-asset data-id=""922098"" class=""chorus-snippet browser_wide_media""> <img src=""http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/922098/diabetes.0.png"" class=""small"" alt=""diabetes""> </chorus-asset></p> \n<p class=""caption"">(<a href=""http://www.brookings.edu/research/interactives/2014/medicare%20spending%20higher%20states%20poor%20health"">Brookings Institute</a>)</p> \n<p>The diabetes averages, Sheiner finds, are really good at predicting the average Medicare spending. She finds that a state's average diabetes rate can explain 70 percent of the variation in spending. And if health problems explain most of the spending variation, that suggests much less room for doctors to cut costs without hurting care.</p> \n<h3><span>Whose data is better?</span></h3> \n<p>Sheiner argues that her averages do a better job at picking up on the health of a population than individual-level characteristics.</p> \n<p>An example: it's definitely helpful to know whether an individual has diabetes to predict how much they spend on health care. But it's even more helpful to know whether that person has had diabetes for years or just acquired it. State-level data, Sheiner argues, does a better job at capturing some of those longer-term trends than a single data point.</p> \n<p><q class=""center"" aria-hidden=""true"">""I don't know how much space for savings actually exists""</q></p> \n<p>""States where the incidence of diabetes is high,"" Sheiner argues in her paper, ""are likely to be in worse health, on average, than in states where the incidence of diabetes is low.""</p> \n<p>Armed with this data, Sheiner argues that the Dartmouth Atlas has made the task of cutting health-care spending seem too easy. She says it explains why, even 16 years after the Atlas launched, the high-spending states haven't become more like the low-spending states.</p> \n<p>""Cross state variation isn't telling us much,"" Sheiner says. ""I don't say we can't cut spending, but I don't think its going to be as easy as Dartmouth has suggested.""</p> \n<h3>Most research comes to a different conclusion</h3> \n<p>Sheiner's argument is at odds with a lengthy body of research.</p> \n<p>The Atlas authors, to start, reject Sheiner's analysis. They argue that looking at state level data can lead to all kinds of weird conclusions that don't make sense. Skinner likes to draw an analogy to state voting patterns.</p> \n<p>""If you look at voting, we know that people who earn less tend to vote Democratic and those who earn more vote Republican,"" Skinner says. ""If you ran state-level regressions on the states that supported Bush, you'd find a correlation with lower-income states. And you'd say that, well this must mean Republicans are poor. But if you look at the actual data within the state, you quickly learn this isn't the case.""</p> \n<p>Instead, Skinner points to a strong body of research that studies variation among individuals — and makes a compelling case that wide swaths of the country have hugely inefficient health care systems.</p> \n<p>One such paper <a href=""http://economics.mit.edu/files/9782"">published</a> this summer looked at what happens to Medicare patients' spending when they move from a high-cost region to a low-cost region. And it shows that, all of a sudden, these patients start to have higher medical spending just by virtue of switching to a higher-spending city.</p> \n<p><q class=""center"" aria-hidden=""true"">there's huge variation in when doctors prescribe beta-blockers — even when its the exact right medicine</q></p> \n<p>Separate Dartmouth research has looked at what percent of patients with chronic heart failure receive beta blockers. In a perfect world, this number would be 100 percent: guidelines recommend these drugs as the standard of care for this particular condition. Research finds that's not the case. There is lots of variation, even among these ideal candidates, of who gets beta blockers. In Connecticut, it's more than 80 percent; in Mississippi, it's less than 40 percent.</p> \n<p>""This is an area where you're looking at ideal candidates for a treatment who are in the same state of health,"" Skinner says. ""This tells you that its not the patients' health that's varying. It's the care they receive.""</p> \n<p>Another angle the Dartmouth research has taken is looking at doctors' beliefs about medicine. There, researchers have <a href=""http://www.nber.org/papers/w19320"">found</a> that doctors who think that ineffective treatments work are (surprise!) more likely to provide that unnecessary care. That suggests that doctors' views about medicine do matter in terms of what care patients receive.</p> \n<h3></h3> \n<h3>The big question: is it possible to make high spenders more efficient?</h3> \n<p>There's one place that both Sheiner and Dartmouth's supporters agree: even if the Dartmouth Atlas is right, that doesn't make health-care reform easy.</p> \n<p><span>When we spoke Wednesday, Sheiner made the point that, for a long time, we've known that Kaiser Permanente, an insurer that owns its own hospitals and employs its own doctors, is really efficient. When economists want to point to a the type of system that is the model for improvement, they often point to Kaiser.</span></p> \n<p>But here's the thing with Kaiser: we've known for decades they do better, but most health-care systems haven't adopted their methods. They remain fragmented and inefficient. ""Economists don't understand why Kaisers haven't taken over the world,"" Sheiner says. ""But they haven't, and you have to wonder why that is.""</p> \n<p>Amitabh Chandra, who has been a <a href=""https://twitter.com/amitabhchandra2"">pointed critic </a>of Sheiner's work, thinks this a valid place to critique the Dartmouth Atlas. It can point out the differences between efficient and inefficient regions of the country. But that doesn't mean we know how to transform the latter areas into high-performing health care systems.</p> \n<p>""Kaiser hasn't taken over the world, and one reason might be we've hit a ceiling of doctors who want to work under that model,"" Chandra says. ""Or maybe some patients don't want Kaiser. That's a constraint that we have to deal with.""</p> \n<p>One of the things that's so difficult about tackling wasteful care, is actually identifying the waste.  At many appointments, doctors have difficulty knowing when treatment is needed - and when it won't provide help at all.</p> \n<p>The medical community tries to address these issues with comparative effectiveness research, studies that compare how different treatments stack up against each other. Obamacare is trying to figure out some of this with its Patient-Centered Outcomes and Research Institute, or PCORI. But that effort is small and hamstrung: it can only compare the effectiveness of treatments and is strictly barred from looking at costs.</p> \n<p>Dartmouth, in either words, might tell us accurately what's broken about American health care. That doesn't necessarily mean that its given us the tools to fix it.</p>"

How to rearrange your environment to lose weight,http://www.vox.com/2014/9/20/6513197/brian-wansink,"""It's easier to become slim by design than slim by will power,"" says Brian Wansink in a Q&A.","<p>The design of a food label, the size of a package, the name of a restaurant item: for more than two decades, Cornell professor Brian Wansink has been studying how these little things add up to shape the decisions we make about our food — and reshape our bodies. You may remember Wansink from such classic research as ""the <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15761167"">bottomless bowls</a>"" study, which showed that people will mindlessly guzzle down soup as long as their bowls are automatically refilled, or the ""<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=wansink+stale+popcorn"">bad popcorn</a>"" study, which demonstrated that we'll gobble up stale and unpalatable food when it's presented to us in huge quantities.</p> \n<div class=""align-right"">\n<img alt=""wansink"" class=""small"" src=""http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/1084512/wansink_ap_NEW_credit_Jason_Koski_Cornell_News_Bureau.0.JPG""> \n<p class=""caption"">Brian Wansink. (Photo: Jason Koski.)</p> \n</div> \n<p>Over the years, Wansink has become increasingly convinced that, perhaps more than anything, we need to redesign our environments to nudge people toward healthy eating. ""It's easier to become slim by design  than slim by will power,"" he told Vox. ""Design you change once; will power you have  to do every day for the rest your life.""</p> \n<p>With a new book out, <a href=""http://www.slimbydesign.org/"">Slim by Design</a>, Vox spoke to him about the small changes he thinks people should make to live healthier lives and how consumers can be empowered to alter their surroundings — from restaurants to grocery stores and schools — in a way that could help us all lose weight.</p> \n<p><b>Julia Belluz: What made you start looking at the impact of our surroundings on our bodies? </b><br><br>Brian Wansink: I have been researching in this area of how you can influence healthy eating for 25 years. We had been doing research on packaging, and found that smaller packages mean people end up eating dramatically less food. I found people would pay a premium for smaller packages. I told M&amp;M, Mars and Nabisco to make 100-calorie packs. They didn't believe it at first, but they eventually made them, and that ended up being a huge success. Since then, I've been looking at what are the things in our environments that trip us up. With <i>Slim by Design</i>, I'm looking more broadly across society: what we can do ourselves, in our homes, our restaurants, where we shop, to be healthier.</p> \n<p><b><b>JB: </b>In the book, you note that most Americans eat more than  80 percent of their food within five miles of where they live, and you  call for a consumer-led movement to re-engineer these spaces. Can you  tell me about what this looks like?</b><br><br>BW: For example, we have this  100-point scorecard  for lunch rooms in schools. Instead of banning  chocolate milk, it gives schools points if they make white milk more  convenient and attractive to  drink. If there is fruit that's  provided  within two feet of a cash register, they'd get another point. If they  name the healthy vegetables cool names, another point. Most school  lunchrooms  initially only score between 20 to 30 points. These changes  can be  made in a weekend and cost almost nothing to do.<br><br><br><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""center"">""The reason I'm not very sanguine  about policy is that it tremendously backfires. I can guess in 1920 that  they thought prohibition was going to be a great Idea.""</q> <b><b><br>JB: </b>So consumers hold the answer to the obesity crisis?</b><br><br>BW:  Up until now, consumers haven't really known that they could ask a   restaurant to change, or ask their workplace or school to make changes.  They didn't know what to ask. That's been my mission for the last seven  years: trying to figure out what can be done that works. If we get a  restaurant to offer half-size portions, it's not just us  who benefit,  it's all the people who didn't realize to ask for half-size  portions.  Then a sea change happens. To cause a transformation, we can't do it by  shaking a finger at restaurants or grocery stores. You have to do it by   hitting it where it counts the most: having consumers say ""here's what I   want.""</p> \n<p><b><b>JB: </b>Handing the responsibility to the individual somewhat  takes this problem out of the realm of policy. You aren't a fan of  policy solutions, are you? </b><br><br>BW: The reason I'm not very sanguine  about policy is that it tremendously backfires. I can guess in 1920 that  they thought Prohibition was going to be a great  idea. There's a lot  of things I don't think it would be a good idea to  ask restaurants to  do, that won't make them more money,  but there are a lot of things they can do that would help us eat better  and they'd make more money: offering half-size portions, not offering  bread baskets. <br><br>What we've tried to do in the past is to fight the  obesity crisis by  asking the individual to do it: saying it's will  power and education.  We  tried to become slim by willpower and then  slim by policy, and that  didn't  work well. What we haven't done is  engage the consumer.</p> \n<p><b>JB: What are the health hazards people can change immediately?</b><br><br>BW: People need to make sure they have a fruit bowl within two feet of where they regularly  walk in their kitchen. The second change I'd make is don't eat lunch at your  desk. Go out to lunch. Get away from the desk. You'll not only feel happier but you'll be  less likely to overeat snacks and you're going to enjoy things more. The third thing I'd do would be to <a href=""http://www.slimbydesign.org/school-resources/"">go this website</a> and print out the scorecard  for your child's school and give it to the food services director and  principal to work on.</p> \n<p><b><b>JB: </b>If it's our surroundings that count when it comes to obesity, how do you explain the individual-level differences among people in the same places: the fact that some members of a household for example have vastly different weights.</b><br><br>BW: It's a good question. To understand that, we're going to have a <i>Slim By Design</i> registry. We want to know what healthy  weight people, who have never had a weight fluctuation, know that the rest of us don't know. If we knew what they  did differently we would have some idea of how we might want to change. So  this registry invites people to come there and if they can qualify, we  ask them about 100 different questions: describe your typical breakfast, what  do you do when you're hungry in the afternoon. We ask them questions  and the goal is to come up with a series of answers about what slim people  do that makes them thin or able to avoid food and not have these food  cravings most of us have.</p> \n<p><b><b></b></b></p> \n<p><b><b>JB: </b>We know obesity is a disease that disproportionately affects lower income, less educated, and minority populations. How do you reach these consumers? </b><br><br>BW: If only 20 percent of us are getting  empowered, those people are going to benefit natively. All of a sudden,  fast food restaurants put healthy stuff at the top of menu boards, or have  little table tins that advertise water or milk instead of soda. It's all the people who didn't even know they had a problem that will benefit by being in an  environment that we've changed.</p>"
Doctors wanted to extend life. Instead they extended death.,http://www.vox.com/2014/9/19/6549317/doctors-wanted-to-extend-life-instead-they-extended-death,Why one doctor thinks old age is a fate worse than death.,"<p><i>In a powerful </i><a href=""http://www.theatlantic.com/features/archive/2014/09/why-i-hope-to-die-at-75/379329/"">essay</a><i> for the Atlantic, Ezekiel Emanuel, head of the Department of Medical Ethics and Health Policy at Pennsylvania University, says that he hopes to die at age 75. He's 57 now, and he's not contemplating suicide or any kind of physician-assisted death, but after he turns 75, he will refuse all life-extending interventions — including antibiotics to fight infections. We spoke on Friday, and a lightly edited transcript of our conversation follows. </i></p> \n<p><b>Ezra Klein: You hold two positions here that seem to be in tension with each other. On the one hand, you want to die at age 75. On the other hand, you are loudly and publicly opposed to euthanasia. Why, if you think it is a good and valuable choice to die early, shouldn't you have the legal right to make that happen?</b></p> \n<p>Ezekiel Emanuel: I<span>f you look at people who want euthanasia it's not who we think it is. It's not people writhing in pain. It's not people who can't breathe because of emphysema. It's people who are depressed and hopeless and don't see meaning in life. I don't think the right answer to that question is, ""let's give them some pills to knock them off."" They need meaning back in their life. They need therapy or medication. Euthanasia, I think the research shows, is much more like suicide than it is like a medical treatment.</span></p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""center""><span>My piece about wanting to die at 75 is really about what gives your life meaning</span></q></p> \n<p>My piece about wanting to die at 75 is really about what gives your life meaning, and the need to really think about that. Someone e-mailed me and said, well, my father is having a great time telling stories to his grandchildren about growing up in New York City. And that's fantastic! But I remember my grandfather and what I remember most about him is his vigor and love of life. I remember his huge right hand, his reaching into a hot oven to pull out bagels, his running around with us. It would be horrible if my memories of my grandfather were just him shuffling around and telling us memories of his childhood in Chicago. And, similarly, what I want to leave my kids and my grandkids is a very certain kind of memory of me as vigorous, fun, someone they can travel with and horse around with.</p> \n<p><b>EK: Let me push on this for a moment though. You say you'll reject any life-extending medical intervention after age 75. And you take that pretty far. You won't even accept antibiotics. But you might still get dementia and undergo a slow decline. You may still get cancer and waste away. So if the point is to control how you're remembered, shouldn't you be able to end your life at a time of your choosing?</b></p> \n<p>EE: In the families I've seen where that has occurred, the circumstances of the death itself become the overwhelming memory. Either it's dad committed suicide or we helped dad die. It washes out everything else. Even when it comes to terminating care — and being an oncologist I've spoken to many families about this — they are all worried that they're killing their father. And you have to reassure them that they're not killing him, that this is nature taking it's course. You don't want how you died to become the narrative of your life.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""center""><span>You don't want how you died to become the narrative of your life.</span></q></p> \n<p><b>EK: One of the things your article lays out in detail is that we have prolonged life but we have not prolonged health. That seems like a terrible indictment of our medical advances.</b></p> \n<p>EE: There's this idea that as we grow older we'll be healthier. I call it the rectangularization of life. You go on as healthy as you've always been and then at the end you just fall off a cliff and die of a heart attack or stroke or something. But over the last 30 years the data has said the opposite. As we add years of life we're adding more years of life with disabilities. We are saving more people who have strokes. That's a triumph. But the consequence is people are living after strokes and they typically have disabilities - they have speech problems or cognitive problems. There's a tradeoff. We have extended the dying process.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""right""><span>We have extended the dying process</span></q></p> \n<p>Partly, this reflects good news. If you take the whole 20th century early on we expanded lifespan because we eliminated childhood diseases. Once you saved a child from whooping cough they lived a perfectly normal life. But beginning in the 1960s, we had done most of what we could do. There's a bit further to go — I point out in the article that infant mortality is way too high in America — but we're not going to get very much life extension out of saving kids. The life extension we're getting is prolonging people over 65, and that means prolonging the lives of people with disabilities.</p> \n<p>One of the reasons I'm against using life expectancy and birth as a metric of how a lifespan performs is we don't ask how many years are really good years for people? More is not always better. More years with Alzheimer's is not necessarily better.</p> \n<p><b>EK: Do you believe in anything after death?</b></p> \n<p>EE: I'm Jewish. I go to synagogue often, I keep kosher in two houses, but I'm an atheist. I think we return to the worms. By the way, though, I think people who believe in god should be perfectly fine with my view. You just get to heaven a little faster.</p> \n<p><b>EK: This piece gives your family an unusual level of clarity about what you do and don't want done after you turn 75. You didn't just write up an advance directive. You published it in a national magazine. But a lot of people don't have this conversation with their family or their doctors. In politics, when we got anywhere near this discussion, we got ""death panels."" </b></p> \n<p>EE: This is a hard conversation to have. I spent 30 years of my career devoted to end-of-life care. A lot of that was developing a new kind of advanced care directive called the medical-care directive to help with that. If I've done nothing else but stimulate families to talk about this I think it's an important public service. I think most Americans want to have this conversation but they're afraid of it, they're worried that having the conversation will communicate something awful.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""center""><span>we don't ask how many years are really good years for people? </span></q></p> \n<p>That said, when I started out in the 1980s, and I said in Harvard Medical School I wanted to work on end-of-life care, the dean of students basically said to me, ""that's a career ender."" He was wrong and I was right. And in America, we're doing a much better job. When I started out in cancer, 60 or 70 percent of the people who died from cancer died in the hospital. Now it's under 25 percent who die in the hospital. We do a much better job with hospice and other things here. It's not as if the country hasn't progressed. It has progressed.</p>"

The case against dying at 75,http://www.vox.com/2014/9/28/6850813/why-i-want-to-die-at-75-case-against,We haven't extended dying. We've made living longer.,"<p>""Health care,"" Ezekiel Emanuel<a href=""http://www.theatlantic.com/features/archive/2014/09/why-i-hope-to-die-at-75/379329/""> wrote</a> in his recent Atlantic cover story, ""hasn't slowed the aging process so much as it has slowed the dying process.""</p> \n<p>Emanuel's article makes the case that being old in America has gotten a lot worse. While life expectancy has grown, he argues, those additional years are riddled with disease and disability.</p> \n<p>Emanuel cites the research of Eileen Crimmins at the University of Southern California, who wrote a <a href=""http://psychsocgerontology.oxfordjournals.org/content/66B/1/75/T3.expansion.html"">2010 pape</a>r showing that older Americans spend more time living with disease and limited functioning. This suggests that the elderly spend more time dying than they did a decade or two ago.</p> \n<p>But Crimmins' paper isn't the only research on the issue. And separate work, some of which comes from Harvard health economist David Cutler, suggests that older Americans are living healthier lives. They do get diseases earlier than previous generations<b> </b>but are able to manage the effects better. And the number of years spent disabled is now on a decades-long decline.</p> \n<h3>There are lots of ways to measure quality of life</h3> \n<center> <img alt=""old age"" class=""small"" src=""http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/1404086/71268995.0.jpg""> \n<p class=""caption"">Old age: maybe not so terrible! (Christopher Furlong / Getty Images News)</p> \n</center> \n<p><span>There are lots of different ways for health economists to measure quality of life. Four metrics, in particular, turn up in the research on what counts as a good life for seniors. </span></p> \n<p>One metric that's easily available is disease — whether or not, for example, an individual has had a heart attack in their life or been diagnosed with cancer. There's some reason to think this isn't an especially good metric, and we'll get into that a bit more later.</p> \n<p>The three other metrics are more qualitative metrics, where seniors describe what they can and can't do. Researchers look at whether people have physical limitations — these aren't disabilities, per se, but difficulty doing physical activities that most would find easy. These include things like walking a quarter mile or climbing up 10 steps.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""center"">""Substantial strides have been made dealing with the consequences of disease""</q></p> \n<p>Researchers can get at this another way, by asking whether people have difficulty with the necessary actions to start the day. These are called, in the research, ""activities of daily living"" and include things like eating, dressing, and using the toilet.</p> \n<p>Last, researchers also look at a category called ""instrumental activities of daily living."" That includes the basic things that tend to happen during a given day, like preparing one's own meals or using the telephone.</p> \n<p>Looking at different measures you can get vastly different pictures of how quality of life has changed for older Americans.</p> \n<h3>Americans are spending more years with disease</h3> \n<center> <img src=""http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/1404088/108987265.0.jpg"" class=""small"" alt=""helath care seniors""> \n<p class=""caption"">(Justin Sullivan / Getty News Images)</p> \n</center> \n<p><span>Crimmins' work looks at the first two metrics: how long people are living with disease and whether they have a functional limitation. She finds that, inarguably, as people live longer they spend more years living with disease as life expectancy extends.</span></p> \n<p>At the same time, however, we've also gotten a lot better at treating disease. Heart attack patients live longer and survival rates for cancer have grown. Living with disease, then, isn't an especially good metric of what quality of life the elderly enjoy — something Crimmins acknowledges in her work.</p> \n<p>""Substantial strides have been made in dealing with the consequences of disease,"" she writes. ""Diseases are both less lethal and less disabling; they have become more chronic but perhaps less progressive.""</p> \n<p>As Crimmins writes elsewhere in her paper, ""the most consistent findings of improving health in the older population have been in decreases in indicators of functioning problems and reductions in disability.""</p> \n<p>This isn't to say old age has become problem-free. As Crimmins measures it, older Americans now live longer with reduced mobility. The elderly spend more years having trouble walking a quarter mile or climbing ten steps. The number of men over 80 reporting limited mobility, for example, has grown from 27.7 percent in 1998 to 41.7 percent in 2006. It's worth nothing though, that other age groups saw similar increases in limited mobility over the same time period.</p> \n<center> <img alt=""moblity"" class=""small"" src=""http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/1404064/limited_mobility.0.png""> </center> \n<p>The trend looks similar among women, except that women tend to report higher levels of mobility limitations than men.</p> \n<h3>Americans are also spending fewer years disabled</h3> \n<p>Culter measures quality of life differently, looking at the number of years that Americans spend with a disability that gets in the way of activities of daily living (those are the things like getting dressed or cleaning the house). And, <a href=""http://www.nber.org/papers/w19268"">in research published last year</a>, he found that Americans are spending fewer years disabled than they used to. Dying has gotten shorter, in his view, not longer.</p> \n<p>Using surveys of Medicare patients, Cutler shows that, in the early '90s, the average 65-year-old could expect to live an additional 17.5 years. Of that time, 8.8 years would be disability free but 8.7 would be with some kind of limitation.</p> \n<p>A little over a decade later, in the mid-2000s, life expectancy for a 65-year-old had lengthened to 18.2 years — and years spent disabled shortened to 7.8.</p> \n<center> <img src=""http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/1404070/life_expectancy_cutler.0.png"" class=""small"" alt=""disabiled years cutler""> </center> \n<p><span>The declines in disabled years (and overall increases in life expectancy) show up across men and women and across black and white seniors.</span></p> \n<p>""Our results show clearly that over the 1991-2009 period, disability has been compressed into the period just before death,"" Cutler and his co-authors, Kaushik Ghosh and Mary Beth Landrum, write. ""Disability-free life expectancy rose, and disabled life expectancy declined.""</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""left"">Americans are living fewer disabled years than ever before</q></p> \n<p><span>Much of the debate about quality of life in old age is, at its core, a debate about what counts as happy living. Some might find the physical limitations — the inability to walk a quarter mile, or climb 10 stairs — an unacceptable standard of living, even if they could go about the daily tasks of life. Others might think that, as long as they can continue with their everyday routines, life is pretty great.</span></p> \n<p>Emanuel, in a way, agrees that different people have different standards of living. ""I am not saying that those who want to live as long as possible are unethical or wrong,"" he writes. ""That is their choice, and I want to support them.""</p> \n<p>But the assumption that Americans will face more limitations, rather than fewer, as they age isn't fully supported by the research. Instead, there's lots of reasons to believe that older Americans are living healthier lives than ever before.</p>"

Implantable birth control requires no work on the part of the patient after a doctor inserts the device.

Birth control pills, meanwhile, have a failure rate of 9 percent, more than ten times the rate of most IUDs.</p> \n<p>IUD use has proven to be incredibly effective in small experiments to control teen pregnancy. For example, when a Colorado program made the contraceptives available at no cost to low-income teens, it led to a <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/7/7/5877505/colorado-contraceptives-teen-pregnancy-birth-control"">40 percent drop </a>in birth rates over four years.</p>"

For decades, physicians and pharmaceutical  companies have  enjoyed cozy relationships. Though these links have led  to the  discovery of life-saving drugs and devices, they have also bred  harmful  conflicts of interest. <a href=""http://projects.propublica.org/graphics/bigpharma"">Lawsuits in recent years</a> revealed that doctors' relationships with industry can alter their   prescribing practices and decision-making for the worse, and   pharmaceutical companies have paid out billions of dollars in fines for  fraudulent marketing practices.<br><br>These relationships have  been mostly cloaked in secrecy and hidden from view — until today. This afternoon a government-run <a href=""http://cms.gov/openpayments/"">Open Payments website</a> went live, detailing 4.4 million payments to more than 546,000 doctors and 1,360  teaching hospitals. In total, they show that industry paid doctors and  hospitals at least $3.5 billion in only the last five months of 2013.<br><br>Here's what you need to know:</p> \n<h3>1) The Sunshine Act makes it possible to see which Big Pharma and medical device companies pay your doctor</h3> \n<p data-para-count=""369"" data-total-count=""854"" itemprop=""articleBody"">The <a href=""https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2013/02/08/2013-02572/medicare-medicaid-childrens-health-insurance-programs-transparency-reports-and-reporting-of#h-24"">Sunshine law</a> is part of the Affordable Care Act, passed by Congress in 2010. It   mandates that every pharmaceutical and medical device company in the   country annually disclose payments made to doctors and teaching   hospitals for a range of activities — including promotional speaking,   research grants, meals, and trips of at least $10 value. In addition,  manufacturers and group  purchasing organizations are required to report  physician ownership or  investment interests.    <br><br>The companies had to  provide details to  the federal agency, the Centers for Medicare  and Medicaid Services  (CMS), about what they gave to whom and why, the  amount and date of the  payment, the name and address of the recipient,  the associated physician  ID number, the form of the payment (cash,  services, stock options,  etc.), and a few words about the context under  which the payment was  made. <br><br>Payments about medical  doctors, osteopaths, chiropractors, podiatrists, dentists, and  optometrists are <a href=""http://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2014/09/30/352725703/database-flaws-cloud-sunshine-on-industry-payments-to-doctors"" target=""_blank"">had to be reported</a> but not nurse practitioners and physician  assistants  since the law doesn't require reporting on payments to these groups.<br><br>CMS made this information public in  an <a href=""http://cms.gov/openpayments/"">online, searchable database</a> that launched on September 30.</p> \n<h3>2) The act was passed because payments by industry to health professionals can lead to bad medicine</h3> \n<p>The idea behind the database is simple: by shedding light on payments   to  medical professionals, the public can be informed about potential    conflicts of interest. The sunshine is also meant to deter potentially    harmful doctor-industry relations.<br><br>This type of remedy has been a long-time coming.

And while $3.5 billion  in payments sounds like a lot, it's estimated that companies spend about<a href=""http://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/fact-sheets/2013/11/11/persuading-the-prescribers-pharmaceutical-industry-marketing-and-its-influence-on-physicians-and-patients""> $30 billion a year</a> on marketing, so again, this is only a snapshot of what's  actually going on between doctors and industry. <br><br>What's more, CMS  says 40 percent of the 4.4 million records they collected are  ""de-identified"" for now. This means that nearly half of the data on the database  will not contain the name of the physician or teaching hospital that  received a payment but only the name of the manufacturer because of  unresolved concerns about the accuracy of the data. They promise this data  will be fully identifiable by June 2015.<br><br>About  199,000 records that were collected won't be published at all today. Of  these, CMS says 190,000 are being withheld because they met the criteria  for a delay in publication since they involved a new product or one that's under  regulatory review by the Food and Drug Administration. The remaining  9,000 were not published because of ongoing disputes with industry about  the accuracy of the data.<br><br>So this means that some payments to  doctors and hospitals just won't show up, and the fact that you don't  find a doctor or hospital listed doesn't mean they haven't been paid.</p> \n<h3>5) Doctors are worried about the accuracy of the data</h3> \n<p>The American Medical Association, along with dozens of health professional groups and medical societies, had <a href=""http://freepdfhosting.com/aad0b68522.pdf"">asked</a> the federal government to delay the launch of the database for six months. They wanted   more time to review the data. <br><br>CMS didn't comply, which has been a   sticking point for   doctors, who also <a href=""http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2014-09-29/get-ready-to-learn-a-lot-more-about-doctors-payments-from-pharma"">heavily lobbied</a> against the Act along with industry.<br><br><q class=""left"">""The CMS website had so many bugs in it""</q>AMA  president Dr. Robert Wah tells Vox, ""We are   concerned that with this  data release, patients may take the information   out of context or more  importantly that there will be inaccuracies   within the data."" <br><br>He   says CMS provided doctors with too little time to correct the data    (45 days) and that the website's user interface made it difficult   to  correct mistakes. Of the more than half a million doctors on the database, CMS says only about 26,000 registered on their Open Payments website to review their and 400 hospitals did so.<br><br>Dr. Aaron Carroll, assistant dean for   research mentoring at Indiana University School of Medicine, was one of the few who got online to check his data, and he had one of   those less-than-ideal experiences. When he logged into the CMS site, he found a pharma-sponsored lunch was ascribed to  him  that he actually didn't participate in. It then took him hours to   dispute and correct the claim. ""The website had so many bugs in it. Half   the time I would click things, and no matter what I did, I was brought   to an error screen. It was just a horrible,"" he says.<br><br>While the   mistake was so minimal — a $15 meal — that even if it wasn't caught,  it  wouldn't harm his career, he worried about the reputations of his   colleagues who might have bigger errors attributed to them that they   only learn about with the launch of the site. ""I don't know how easy it   will be to correct or fight this stuff.""<br><br>For now, users of the   database must proceed with caution, keeping in mind data may be   incorrect or that it may be misleading or unrepresentative.</p> \n<h3>6) Some of this data is already publicly available <br>\n</h3> \n<p>Journals now require physicians to disclose their conflicts of    interest, and so do some hospitals. Several states — such as Maine,    Massachusetts, Minnesota, and Vermont —  mandate the public reporting of    financial relationships, too. <br><br>Legal settlements with the   Office  of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human    Services  have also forced more than a dozen  pharmaceutical companies   to report  their relations with physicians  under ""corporate integrity   agreements,""  and several pharma companies and medical device   manufacturers  voluntarily report payments to doctors on their own   websites. <br><br>Notably,  ProPublica, the  investigative news website, has  been tracking   publicly   reported payments to doctors since 2010 on its  easily  searchable <a href=""http://projects.propublica.org/docdollars/"">Dollars for Docs database</a>.<br><br><b>Dollars for Docs</b><br> <a href=""http://projects.propublica.org/docdollars/""><img src=""http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/1406692/dollars_fordocs.0.jpg"" class=""small"" alt=""dollarsfordocs""> </a><br>So  this data about conflicts of interest exists  elsewhere. But what's    supposed to be different about the newly-launched database is that   it  is designed to  be a central location for payment data building    annually from 2013. There's also the possibility that CMS can audit   reports and fine stakeholders for lying, which means it should   theoretically be more accurate than other company-run databases.</p> \n<h3>7) Critics say disclosure isn't enough</h3> \n<p>Time will tell whether this turns out to be the comprehensive and   user-friendly resource it is supposed to be, and CMS emphasizes that it's a work in progress.. But right now, many   observers are skeptical. <br><br><q class=""left"">""Is the patient  going to know that this information is out there, and know  where to go  find it?""</q>Dr. <a href=""http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/profiles/results/directory/profile/0018306/martin-makary"">Marty Makary</a>,    associate professor of surgery at Johns Hopkins, pointed out that   while  there is already public disclosure of industry ties in many   places,  doctors still don't have to report their conflicts to patients   during  their everyday interactions. He wondered why this hasn't   happened yet and whether patients will have the  wherewithal to check   databases for this information. <br><br>""Is the patient  going to know   that this information is out there, and know  where to go  find it?"" he   asks. ""Those are real barriers to the world of patient-centered  care.""<br><br>There's also the question of whether and how this database will actually change behavior. Dr. <a href=""http://www.drugepi.org/faculty-staff-trainees/faculty/aaron-kesselheim/"">Aaron Kesselheim</a>,    an associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, says,  ""I   don't know that there's any good evidence yet on how these data are    going to effect patients or physicians."" <br><br>For example, one <a href=""http://archinte.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=1170047"">study</a> used the state sunshine laws already implemented in Maine and West   Virginia  to see what effect they had on doctors'  prescribing of   cholesterol-lowering statins and selective  serotonin reuptake    inhibitors for some mood disorders. These classes of drugs have good    generic alternatives but pharmaceutical companies heavily marketed the    branded versions to doctors. The researchers found physicians continued   to  prescribe branded medications, and that the state laws had little    impact on prescribing practices.</p> \n<p><q class=""right"">there's a lot of work on Conflict of interest left to be donE</q>""[Sunshine]   is a long time coming, it's a welcome evolution,""  Kesselheim says.   ""But there's a lot of work left to be done. It's going  to be important   to use the data and figure out how to use the data in  the right way to   try to better educate physicians and patient.""<br><br>Trudo Lemmens, a   University of Toronto-based expert on pharmaceutical regulation,  worries  that mandatory disclosures could become ""a  cleansing ritual""  for  doctors with little actual impact on the profession or patients.  ""You  get rid of your sins by  confessing, then the problems with  conflict of  interest are washed  away,"" he says. <br><br>""We've seen  studies  suggesting that when disclosure is introduced  as a method by  physicians  telling their patients — 'I'm being paid by  company x' — in  a strange  way it sometimes leads patients to have greater  trust in  the  specialists."" <br><br>Lemmens hopes people are aware of these <a href=""http://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/sds/docs/loewenstein/PitfallsdisclosingCOI.pdf"">pitfalls</a> and that disclosure doesn't just replace more effective means of actually disinfecting industry-physician relationships. <br><br>Unintended   consequences also include the potential that transparency could have   the opposite of the desired effect among some highly-paid,   entrepreneurial specialties — such as surgeons who work closely with   medical device companies, says the director of Columbia University's   Center for the Study of Society and Medicine      David Rothman.  <br><br>""These   are the entrepreneurs,"" Rothman says. ""They may take publication of   income, their money, as a point of pride. It's possible sunshine will   breed a kind of horse race and doctors will turn to a company and say   'hey all my colleagues are getting x, I'm only getting y. I want more.'""</p> \n<h3>8) Some worry the database will deter potentially beneficial industry ties</h3> \n<p>As the AMA said in a statement, ""Just because a  physician has a   relationship with industry does not automatically mean  that his or  her   professional judgment has been influenced inappropriately."" <br><br>Dr. Thomas Stossel, known as Harvard's ""<a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2009/4/24/the-pro-industry-professor-for-the-first/"">pro-industry professor</a>,""   says doctors' work with industry is ""necessary and beneficial."" He   worries that the Sunshine Act could make it embarrassing and difficult   for doctors to do work like developing medical devices or designing   clinical trials, and that industry may start avoiding working with   American doctors because of the time and investment disclosure will   require.  <br><br>""Some smaller companies may think this is too much   trouble,"" he says. ""They'll say 'we're not going to contract with   American medical schools, we'll just do it in Croatia.""</p> \n<h3>9) The money is already moving elsewhere</h3> \n<p>There are other limits to the Sunshine Act. Namely, conflicts of   interest are a moving target. Payments to  health professionals for   marketing have been plummeting in recent years. It's possible that since   this law was conceptualized and enacted, the target has already  shifted  and companies may now be required to disclose their  least-troubling  marketing practices.<br><br><q class=""center"">Companies such as GlaxoSmithKline have already reported that they'll be moving away from paying doctors to market their drugs</q><br><br> According to ProPublica,  ""Eli Lilly and Co.'s payments to speakers   dropped by 55 percent, from  $47.9 million in 2011 to $21.6 million in   2012."" During that time, Pfizer's payments decreased by  62 percent,   from about $22 million to $8.3  million. Companies including   GlaxoSmithKline have already reported that they'll be moving away from   paying doctors to market their drugs soon, and instead train their own   in-house physicians to do the job. <br><br>Kesselheim has run some of   these analyses and also found payments to physicians are shrinking over   time. ""In the back of your mind, there's a concern that if you   shed   some light on one aspect of pharma marketing, that there will  be  ways,   people will try to skirt or game the system to try to avoid the     sunshine."" <br><br>So if payments to doctors have been declining in    recent years, the question now is where the money is being  spent and   what changes will need to be made to the Sunshine Act to reflect them .</p> \n<h3>10) We are entering a new era of transparency</h3> \n<p>No matter what happens today, it's important to note that this move   is part of a new era of transparency in doctor-industry relations,   however imperfect. Even the skeptics think this is a solid, if   incomplete and overdue, step in the right direction.</p> \n<div class=""align-left""> \n<p><img alt=""grassley"" class=""small"" src=""http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/1406826/178229429.0.jpg""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Sen.

Stop reading this story and go get a flu shot,http://www.vox.com/2014/10/1/6882145/stop-reading-this-story-and-go-get-a-flu-shot,Here's a more productive way to stay healthy this fall than worrying abut the incredibly unlikely event of an American Ebola outbreak: Get a flu shot.,"<p>Here's a more productive way to stay healthy this fall than worrying abut the incredibly unlikely event of an American <a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/ebola-facts-you-need-to-know/what-is-the-ebola-virus#E6645776"">Ebola</a> outbreak: Get a flu shot.</p> \n<p>It's cheap, its inexpensive, and it will help safeguard you against a disease that kills thousands of people each year. The Centers for Disease Control<a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6332a3.htm""> recommends</a> that all Americans older than 6 months get <a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/vaccines/what-is-vaccine"">vaccinated</a> annually. Unless you are a particularly precocious 5-month-old, this includes you.</p> \n<h3>Why should I get the flu vaccine?</h3> \n<p>To protect yourself and those around you.</p> \n<p>Let's say you're a selfish person (we're not judging). The best reason to get a flu shot is to protect yourself against the upcoming flu season. The flu can be deadly; in 2004, an especially vicious outbreak killed more than <a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6332a3.htm"">48,000 people</a> in the US. Not every flu season is this bad. Others have killed as few as 3,000 people. But it's really hard to predict in advance how bad each flu season will be and a flu shot is a relatively cheap and easy way to hedge your bet against a bad season.</p> \n<p>If you care any bit about those around you, there's an even more compelling case for vaccination. <span>Vaccines work best when lots and lots of people are immunized. This is a concept known in science as ""herd immunity,"" something that pediatrician Aaron Carroll explains incredibly well in the video below. </span></p> \n<p><iframe frameborder=""0"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/ZuiHFg_nfnE"" height=""315"" width=""560""></iframe></p> \n<p>If a small number of people are vaccinated, that's a bit of a roadblock for the disease — but likely not an insurmountable one. There are still lots of unprotected people susceptible to the sickness. And the handful of people who are immunized aren't entirely safe, either. Vaccines do significantly reduce the risk of getting sick, but they aren't bulletproof. The flu vaccine, for example, was estimated to have a 61 percent success rate this year at blocking disease.</p> \n<p>If vaccines are going to work, they rely heavily ""on the decreased likelihood that anyone will come into contact with the disease,"" Carroll says.</p> \n<p>When you get vaccinated, it makes it harder for other people you come into contact with to catch the flu. This is important if you ever interact with the elderly, whose weaker immune systems aren't as able to fight off the infection. In other words: if you love your grandparents, get a flu shot.</p> \n<h3>Why shouldn't I get a flu vaccine?</h3> \n<p>That's a trick question: you should! But 58 percent of American adults don't, according to <a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/flu/fluvaxview/coverage-1314estimates.htm"">the most recent figures</a>. Flu is a disease with some of the lowest vaccination rates. While lots of other vaccinations are required for kids to go to school, the flu has no similar nudge.</p> \n<p>One <a href=""http://www.rand.org/pubs/research_briefs/RB9572.html"">2011 survey</a> found they have a lot of excuses. About three in ten Americans say they don't need a flu shot. Another 16 percent just don't get around to it.</p> \n<p><img src=""http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2336924/flu_shots_.0.png"" alt=""flu chart"" data-chorus-asset-id=""2336924""></p> \n<p>Let's go through a few of the excuses.</p> \n<p><i>I don't need it</i>: The CDC thinks otherwise, and recommends the flu vaccine for all adults. Whether or not you caught the flu last year says nothing about your susceptibility this season. And, as mentioned earlier, the flu vaccine isn't just about you: more vaccinated people means more protection for everyone around you.</p> \n<p><i>I didn't get around to it</i>: Yes, we're all busy. But flu shots are one of the easiest medical treatments to obtain. Walgreen's, CVS, and other major pharmacy chains offer flu shots. In New York City, you can even <a href=""http://finance.yahoo.com/news/media-alert-flu-season-let-120000845.html"">order</a> a flu vaccine straight to your home or office for $25.</p> \n<p><i style=""font-size: 15.5555562973022px; line-height: 1.5;"">I might get sick/suffer side effects</i><span>: First off, the flu shot cannot cause the flu. </span><a style=""font-size: 15.5555562973022px; line-height: 1.5; background-color: #ffffff;"" href=""http://www.cdc.gov/flu/protect/keyfacts.htm"">That is a myth</a><span>: the flu vaccine contains an inactive version of the virus, meaning that it's impossible to become infected. What it can cause is soreness at the site of injection, aches and, in some cases, a low-grade fever. These are relatively minor side effects compared to the flu, which kills thousands of people each year. </span></p> \n<p><i>I dislike needles: </i>Good news! There's a nasal flu vaccine. And the CDC<a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/qa/nasalspray.htm""> says </a>the nasal vaccine is just as good as the version that involves a needle.</p> \n<h3>Where can I get a flu shot?</h3> \n<p>Most drugstores or doctor offices can administer flu shots. To find a location near you, use HealthMap's <a href=""http://flushot.healthmap.org/"">vaccine finder tool</a><a href=""http://%20ealthMap%20found%2050%20different%20places%20where%20I%20could%20get%20a%20flu%20shot%20just%20in%20my%20zip%20code%20(you%20can%20search%20for%20your%20zip%20code%20here).%20"">. </a>Most health insurance covers the complete cost of a flu shot but, for the uninsured, HealthMap provides price data too (Costco, which charges <a href=""http://www.costco.com/Pharmacy/adult-immunization-program.html"">$14.99</a> for a flu shot, seems to have the cheapest price but CVS does offer a 20-percent-off-the-entire-store coupon upon vaccination, if you really want to live large). So find a location, and get vaccinated. There is no good reason not to.</p>"

Wendy Davis attempted to filibuster — had two main abortion restrictions. One was<a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/8/12/5991167/abortion-admitting-privileges-supreme-court""> a requirement</a> that all abortion clinics have admitting privileges at local hospitals. That piece of H.B. 2 went into effect in September 2013, and forced <a href=""http://fundtexaswomen.org/resources/texas-abortion-clinic-map/"">14 clinics </a>that could not obtain admitting privileges to close.</p> \n<p><q class=""center"" aria-hidden=""true"">texas will now have 7 abortion clinics, all in major cities</q></p> \n<p>The other H.B. 2 restriction required abortion clinics to become ambulatory surgical centers, essentially mini-emergency rooms that can handle complex medical situations. Ambulatory surgical centers, for example, must have wide enough hallways to fit a gurney and larger operating rooms than abortion clinics typically use.</p> \n<p><q class=""right"" aria-hidden=""true"">the court found ""no evidence"" closures would impede abortion access</q></p> \n<p>Abortion clinics in Texas have said that upgrading to these new standards would cost upwards of <a href=""http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/opinions/pub/14/14-50928-CV0.pdf"">$1 million</a>. They have argued that the new requirements are unnecessary as abortions tend to have a very low complication risk. Approximately <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23327244"">0.05 percent </a>of first trimester abortions have complications that require hospital care. A Texas district court judge agreed with them and<a href=""http://online.wsj.com/articles/judge-strikes-down-new-texas-abortion-restrictions-1409350588""> found</a> that law to be an ""unconstitutional undue burden on women.""</p> \n<p>But in <a href=""http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/opinions/pub/14/14-50928-CV0.pdf"">the new ruling</a>, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals overturned that opinion, finding the restriction constitutional. The three-judge panel found that Texas women will still be able to obtain abortion and that the longer travel distances would not unduly burden those seeking to terminate pregnancies. As evidence, they cited the fact that the admitting privilege law already shut more than a dozen clinics but that, in these new arguments, they did not see any ""evidence that the previous closures....have caused women to be turned away from clinics.""</p> \n<h3>The key metric in the Texas ruling: what's an undue burden?</h3> \n<p>The Supreme Court has, in previous rulings, articulated standards for judging the constitutionality of abortion restrictions. One key standard is whether a restriction places an ""undue burden"" on those seeking terminate a pregnancy.</p> \n<p><span>The Supreme Court has previously defined an undue burden as a law with the ""purpose or effect of placing a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion of a nonviable fetus."" The Supreme Court has previously ruled that laws requiring women to notify their spouses of their abortion, for example,  are an undue burden as it could make it impossible for some women to access the procedure.</span></p> \n<p><q class=""center"" aria-hidden=""true"">900,000 of texas' 4.5 million reproductive age women will now live 150 miles from an abortion clinic</q></p> \n<p>In this case, a district court ruled that the Texas law <i>was </i>an undue burden because it meant women would have to travel much further to terminate a pregnancy. Approximately 900,000 of Texas' 4.5 million reproductive-age women will now live more than 150 miles from an abortion clinic.</p> \n<p>But the Fifth Circuit panel disagreed: Texas women could, they argued, travel that distance and still find abortion accessible.</p> \n<p><b>Correction: </b>an earlier version of this story said there would be 7 abortion clinics left in Texas.

The project's most <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/10/2/6891337/st-louis-gave-teens-free-birth-control-and-they-now-have-very-low"">recent results,</a> published last week in the New England Journal of Medicine, found that the CHOICE Project's teenage participants had significantly lower abortion and birth rates than women nationwide.

We discussed how the project started, what she learned, and how her group is now trying to increase birth control access elsewhere in the country.</p> \n<p><b>Sarah Kliff: Tell me a little bit about how the CHOICE Project got started. What's been the goal of your work?</b></p> \n<p>Gina Secura: We were approached with the funding, and we started the project in 2007. At that point, we thought the only barrier to women using contraceptives was cost. So we got the study up and running really quickly. We assumed women would come in knowing what they wanted, we'd give it to them and then follow them during the research portion of the project.</p> \n<p>The first person we saw was a 25-year-old educated women with a career, and the person enrolling her asked her what she wanted. She said she didn't know and asked about her options. The person enrolling her ran upstairs and said, ""Gina, what do you want me to tell her?"" We hadn't even thought about this, as something we'd need to do.</p> \n<p>At that point we had one nurse practitioner and there was no way she was going to counsel the 10,000 women we were supposed to see. We did have research assistants running our surveys, so we decided to train them to do it. And we created a script for them to use.</p> \n<p>Now it seems so reasonable but seven years ago, it was a novel idea, which is just so crazy. There's no other medical situation where you'd start without a discussion of the best options. But that happens all the time with birth control. So like I said, we made the script, put it through testing, practice, and counseling, and then we rolled it out.</p> \n<p><b>SK: One of the thing that really stands out about the CHOICE Project population is they choose long-acting, reversible contraceptives (LARCs) at a much higher rate than the general population. What's different about the work that you do that might lead to that decision making?</b></p> \n<p>GS: We found that a lot of women might have known about the IUD but there is so much misinformation. We had the opportunity to educate nearly 10,000 women. We were running our own clinic, and all of our practitioners were very comfortable with IUDs and implants. We started then to partner with other clinics. The idea was our research assistants would go out and travel with the different methods, and leave them at the clinics where clinicians would do insertions.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""center"">A lot of women know about the IUD, but there is so much misinformation</q></p> \n<p>The research assistants would come back and say ""Gina, the clinician wouldn't put it in because the woman has an STD."" Or, ""She's going to make her wait to come back on her period."" [There's a misconception that IUDs are easier to insert during menstruation.]</p> \n<p>These were Planned Parenthoods, Title X clinics, and federally-qualified health clinics. It was specific to some providers and some of it was protocol-driven. These were providers who had been working for a very long time, and some were just uncomfortable with IUDs. There were these myths, like the period makes the insertion easier. It was that kind of stuff we stated working on, and removing those barriers.</p> \n<p><b>SK: I'm curious how the CHOICE Project affects your view on how </b><a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/obamacare-and-contraceptives/what-is-obamacare"">Obamacare's end of cost-sharing for contraceptives</a><b> will increase access. As you describe it now, it sounds like cost is one barrier but not the only one, that there are all these logistical obstacles that Obamacare doesn't really change at all. </b></p> \n<p>GS: As I've reflected on this over the past couple of years, it seems like a no-brainer now, but what we found was that it's not simply cost that is the barrier to birth control. There are all these other barriers that aren't so simple and obvious. If the clinic manager doesn't want to insert an IUD that day for example, and wants you to come back, that's a road block.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""left"">It's not simply cost that is the barrier to birth control</q></p> \n<p>There's nothing like somebody making a decision and acting on it right then. So unless clinics can afford to stock these more expensive methods, we're going to have women and hopefully teens saying, ""I heard about this and I would like it,"" and if it's not available that's going to a problem. How do we get those existing providers trained, comfortable, and confident?</p> \n<p>Cost is big and I'm not saying it's not a barrier, but I think practice patterns play an equally important role in increasing the use of more effective contraceptives.</p> \n<p><b>SK: I know one of the things that CHOICE Project has worked on is informing women about the most effective types of contraceptives, which are long-acting reversible contraceptives like intra-uterine devices. Those are used by a pretty small fraction of American women, but by lots and lots of women in CHOICE. </b></p> \n<p><b>How did you get LARC uptake to be so high? Was that hard? And what was different about what your patients heard, versus other women elsewhere in the country?</b></p> \n<p>GS: It was a complete organizational attitude. I think everybody who worked in our clinic was committed to preventing unintended pregnancy and thought LARCs were a great way to achieve that. When the entire organization believes that, it's hard for anyone to dig their heels in against it.</p> \n<p>If there was one champion, provider, or somebody else in management who said, ""This is what we're going to do,"" people usually got on board. For providers, once they say they weren't hurting a patient or putting them at risk: they would try putting an IUD in a 26-year-old and then might see, ""Okay, that went fine, I'll try it in a teen."" We saw it evolve over time.</p> \n<p><b>SK: You've talked a lot about changing provider practices. What about patients? Did they know much about IUDs going into counseling, and why did they pick them?</b></p> \n<p>GS: What we heard most often was they didn't know about them or, if they knew, it was incorrect information. They'd heard IUDs can move through your body or they can easily fall out or that their boyfriend would be able to feel it. A lot of it was about having a device in your body, and I think that for some women and teens that was just too weird.</p> \n<p>One thing we started doing was we would show them models of where the IUD goes. We would say, ""This is where it goes and there's no way it can travel to any other place unless you had a perforation. Either it will stay there, or it will fall out, and you'll know when that happens.""</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""center"">women hear ""IUDS can move through your body or easily fall out."" it's not true. </q></p> \n<p>This doesn't happen in the United States usually. We would have posters of the reproductive organs, so we can show women what their bodies look like. Our counseling session was taught by health educators who were sitting in an office, not in an exam room, and it was much more of a conversation. We often heard in follow-up surveys patients liked that.</p> \n<p>We definitely heard back from our teens that they liked the support. They felt like they could call us. They liked that we checked in on them.</p> \n<p><b>SK: One thing that surprised me in your recent study on teens in your program is that only two-thirds of the patients kept their LARCs for two or more years. Those methods are supposed to last a few years longer. What's going on there?</b></p> \n<p>GS: We looked at that. And we thought it would be great if they kept them for longer, at least for three years. Most of the reasons for discontinuation were for irregular bleeding. Some teens were okay with it and some weren't.</p> \n<p>I wish it was 80 percent [who kept their LARCs in for two or more years], honestly. But then if you think about it from the other angle it's like, ""Holy cow, most teens will stop their contraceptive method within six months. We have two-thirds of our teens using highly effective methods for two years. We got our 16-year-olds to graduate from high school without getting pregnant.""</p> \n<p><b>SK: So you've run this program in St. Louis for about six years now. Are there any plans to scale up, and disseminate what you've learned?</b></p> \n<p>GS: We've spent the last two years putting all of our learning together. We created a protocol for a LARC-first practice. It's really everything from the scripts to who you hire as desk staff. You need to make sure the person on the phone, sitting at the front desk, can answer the question of what methods are available.</p> \n<p>The other thing we've done is worked with a number of clinics and organizations who have asked for our help. We learn a lot from them.</p> \n<p>I recently retired, but the team is still there. And they've been funded to do some work with  a couple of clinics in Memphis and elsewhere in St. Louis. The idea is to see if the CHOICE model can be replicated in a new setting.</p> \n<p><b>SK: It seems like there's some momentum towards more women, particularly teens, using long-acting contraceptives. The American Academy of Pediatricians recently </b><a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/9/29/6868701/pediatricians-now-recommend-iuds-over-the-pill-for-teen-birth-control"">recommended</a><b> LARCs as the first-line choice for teens, and use has been ticking up slowly. How do you think teenage use of contraceptives is changing?</b></p> \n<p>GS: I think the stars are aligning. I was so excited when the pediatricians' policy came out.</p> \n<p>At the same time, it's not just enough to have recommendations and data. We have to get the right tools to people on the ground. Not just the provider, but everyone from the clinic staff to the front desk staff and the financial people.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""center"">There's actually a financial challenge for clinics to offer the most effective birth control</q></p> \n<p><span>There's actually a </span><span>financial</span><span> challenge for clinics to offer the most effective birth control.

This Harvard researcher wants you to know that your supplements can kill you,http://www.vox.com/2014/10/8/6945793/ingredient-label-vitamin-supplement-health-bath-salts,A new study finds some over-the-counter supplements contain designer drugs that have never been studied in humans.,"<p>In the past, people looking to get high on designer drugs had to seek them out, knowingly risking their health on products like ""bath salts.""</p> \n<p>Now, new research suggests that many consumers may be unknowingly ingesting similar untested designer stimulants — because over-the-counter nutrition supplements can be laced with them.</p> \n<p dir=""ltr"">That's the conclusion of a <a href=""http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/dta.1735/abstract?deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=&amp;userIsAuthenticated=false"">new study</a> published in the journal <i>Drug Testing and Analysis</i>. ""This is the third time in the last year that we have seen a brand-new class of drugs appear in mainstream supplements,"" said lead author Pieter Cohen, an internist and assistant professor at Harvard Medical School, who conducted the research with colleagues in Michigan and the Netherlands. <br><br>Cohen and his co-investigators examined over-the-counter supplements for the presence of a new, designer stimulant called DMBA. Designer drugs are just synthetic variations on the chemical structure of existing drugs, made to have similar effects but avoid being classified as illegal. In this case, DMBA is a man-made version of the chemical <a href=""http://www.fda.gov/Food/DietarySupplements/QADietarySupplements/ucm346576.htm"">DMAA</a>, also known as as 1,3-dimethylamylamine, methylhexanamine or geranium extract.</p> \n<p dir=""ltr""><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""center"">""It took people getting sickened by it — having bleeds in their heads,  dropping dead... that finally moved the FDA to get DMAA  off the market.""</q></p> \n<p>The researchers found DMBA — the new designer stimulant — in a dozen supplements. The health effects of DMBA are unknown because  it has only ever been studied in a small number of cats and dogs, but  never humans. And DMAA — the parent compound from which DMBA is derived — was banned in the US, UK and several other countries because it is linked to strokes, heart failure and sudden death.<br><br>""In 2006, DMAA was introduced on the market, but it should not have been in supplements,"" said Cohen. DMAA was found in dozens of sports and diet pills, selling to the tune of $100 million in 2010 alone. <br><br>""It took people getting sickened by it — having bleeds in their heads, dropping dead running marathons, that pathologists realized were due to DMAA — that finally moved the <a href=""http://www.fda.gov/Food/DietarySupplements/QADietarySupplements/ucm346576.htm"">Food and Drug Administration</a> to get DMAA off the market. That was seven years after it was introduced.""<br><br>But  while it's now illegal to put DMAA in supplements because it poses  such a health risk, the new research shows manufacturers are using a  sister chemical instead. With their new discovery, Cohen said, ""There is no need to wait seven years. Here we are finding the next version of DMAA.""</p> \n<h3>Nutrition supplements are very loosely regulated</h3> \n<p><a style=""font-family: 'Alright Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5; background-color: #ffffff;"" href=""http://harvardpublichealthreview.org/how-americas-flawed-supplement-law-creates-the-mirage-of-weight-loss-cures/"">Cohen is a critic</a><span> of the way the Food and Drug Administration regulates supplements, and said consumers need to be on alert since the labels on their pill bottles might not tell them the full truth about what they are putting in their bodies.</span></p> \n<p>Supplement manufacturers are not required to prove that their products actually do what they are marketed for in humans. So these pills can be promoted for weight loss or any number of health benefits, with no real evidence backing the claims. As Cohen showed, they may also contain chemicals and designer stimulants that have never been tested before.<br><br>There's no organized approach to collecting information about the adverse effects related to supplements, he explained.

As one senator put it: ""The scientific community is almost monolithic against you in terms of the efficacy of those three products that you called miracles.""</p> \n<h3>Consumers need to proceed with caution</h3> \n<p><br>Until there's a more robust regulatory process, Cohen said it has to be buyer beware. ""This category of supplements is sold as if they're going to help you: supplements for weight loss, to improve workouts in the gym. They are often labelled as having tons of diff natural ingredients combined. But actually they might rely on one chemical to have this effect.""And that chemical might be dangerous.</p> \n<p>""No consumer product should kill you. With supplements, we accept it's okay to take these pills, even if they might lead to a heart attack or stroke. To me it's mind boggling that we accept this.""</p>"

CVS has a plan to strong-arm other pharmacies out of selling cigarettes,http://www.vox.com/2014/10/20/7014987/cvs-cigarettes-co-pays-pharmacies,It's CVS' second round in its war against cigarettes.,"<p>Early last month, CVS <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/9/3/6101521/cvs-cigarette-sales-ended-heres-why"" style=""font-size: 15.5555562973022px; line-height: 1.5; background-color: #ffffff;"">became</a><span> the first major pharmacy chain to halt the sales of tobacco products. At its 7,700 pharmacies across the country, cigarette sales are now a thing of the past.</span></p> \n<p>You can think of that as phase one of the CVS war on tobacco. Today, the pharmacy chain <a href=""http://blogs.wsj.com/pharmalot/2014/10/20/smoke-this-caremark-to-charge-extra-co-pay-at-pharmacies-selling-cigarettes/"">announced</a> phase two: making it unprofitable for competitors to sell tobacco either.</p> \n<p>To understand how CVS can wield this kind of influence over other pharmacy chains, you have to understand how its business works. Most of us know CVS as the pharmacy chain with brick and mortar stores all across the country. And that is a big part of CVS' business. But another big part of CVS' business is Caremark, a pharmacy benefits manager.</p> \n<p>Caremark is a company that insurance plans contract with to run the drug side of health coverage, doing things like setting up a pharmacy network and determining co-payments. Most health insurers use pharmacy benefit managers and, in that world, Caremark is one of the biggest players. And CVS announced today that it's bringing Caremark into the fight against tobacco, too.</p> \n<p>Caremark-managed health plans will now charge an additional $15 co-pay for any drugs picked up in a pharmacy that sells tobacco products, the Wall Street Journal's Pharmalot blog<a href=""http://blogs.wsj.com/pharmalot/2014/10/20/smoke-this-caremark-to-charge-extra-co-pay-at-pharmacies-selling-cigarettes/""> reports </a>Monday morning.  More from Ed Silverman there:</p> \n<blockquote style=""margin: 0 0 0 40px; border: none; padding: 0px;""> \n<p>A CVS Health spokeswoman tells us that ""numerous"" Caremark clients have asked about developing a ""tobacco-free"" network of pharmacies. And so, CVS ""is in the process of identifying pharmacies that do not sell tobacco products,"" she writes us. She did not provide a specific start date.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>CVS is using its force as a pharmacy benefit manager to create a huge disadvantage for competitors who sell tobacco. And if consumers in Caremark-managed plans want to avoid that extra $15 co-pay, they can go fill their drugs at the one national chain that doesn't sell cigarettes: CVS.</p> \n<p>This new decision helps explain why CVS was okay with giving up an estimated $2 billion in profits when they decided to end cigarette sales. This change to Caremark policies will likely have the effect of driving more prescriptions into CVS stores, as consumers seek to avoid the $15 surcharge. After all, who wants to pay more for antibiotics just because the store happens to be selling cigarettes in a totally separate aisle?</p> \n<p>CVS told Pharmalot this isn't about profits and that they've had insurers who use Caremark ask about setting up tobacco-free networks. And even if that is the sole motivation, the move will almost certainly help CVS financially — and get their competitors to think twice about their cigarette sales.</p>"

Despite the study’s flaws, AFS used it to falsely claim that GCA caused consumers to lose 17.7 pounds, 10.5 percent of body weight, and 16 percent of body fat with or without diet and exercise, in 22 weeks, the complaint alleges.  <br><br>Although AFS played no part in featuring its study on The Dr. Oz Show, it took advantage of the publicity afterwards by issuing a press release highlighting the show.

""We've got no good data and everything we know is conducted by anonymous questionnaire.""</span></p> \n<p>There are legal ways for doctors to help patients end their lives. Assisting patients, for example, in ending eating or drinking is one way to guarantee death. But that can be a painful end. Patients can become delirious with thirst.

""I've discussed with many experts how I would die from it, and it's a terrible, terrible way to die."" This is the kind of death that, on Saturday, she avoided.</p> \n<h3><span>The Oregon aid-in-dying experience</span></h3> \n<p><span>Three states have passed laws to legalize physician-assisted suicide: Oregon in 1997, Washington in 2008, and Vermont in 2014. In these states there are strict rules about how and when patients can use these laws. </span></p> \n<p>In Oregon, for example, patients must request the terminal medications in writing and then again, 15 days later, orally. There's another 15-day waiting period, after the spoken request, for the patient to fill the prescription. Doctors only grant approximately one in six requests for aid-in-dying, one study found. Cases are routinely rejected if the patient's main motivation appears to be depression or wanting to avoid becoming a burden to others.</p> \n<p>Oregon keeps detailed statistics on who uses the aid-in-dying law (largely the college educated and affluent), what type of diseases they have (mostly cancer) and whether they received hospice care prior to taking the lethal medication (about 85 percent do).</p> \n<p><q class=""center"" aria-hidden=""true"">""for people who believe this can be regulated...the Oregon experience is reassuring.""</q></p> \n<p>In Oregon, physician-assisted suicide is out in the open. That means we can know 752 people used the law to kill themselves between 1997 and 2013. And we can know that about one-third of people who get the prescriptions for lethal medications don't use them, and ultimately die of other causes. We have data that lets us debate whether the law is working well or poorly. We can see if some physicians seem to be abusing it, and we can look for ways to give patients an easier death — or, perhaps, the counseling and pain relief that will let them live a few more good days.</p> \n<p>""For people who believe this can be regulated and made available as a last resort, the Oregon experience is reassuring,"" says Tim Quill, a leading palliative care expert at the University of Rochester who supports aid-in-dying laws. ""It shows that this can happen in the open, and work.""</p> \n<p>In a Facebook post published shortly before she died, <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.people.com/article/brittany-maynard-died-terminal-brain-cancer?xid=socialflow_facebook_peoplemag"">quoted by People</a>, Maynard remained fierce in the face of her disease. ""Today is the day I have chosen to pass away with dignity in the face of my terminal illness, this terrible brain cancer that has taken so much from me ... but would have taken so much more.""</p> \n<p>The question that legislators across the country need to face is why Maynard shouldn't have been allowed to make that choice. Consider<a href=""http://www.9news.com/story/news/local/2014/11/05/without-colo-law-man-plans-to-take-his-own-life/18567219/"" target=""_blank""> the case </a>of Robert Mitton, a 59-year-old Colorado resident with terminal brain cancer. Mitton received his diagnosis in January and was told he has six months left to live. Since Colorado doesn't have any death with dignity law, Mitton plans to end his life himself by pulling a plastic bag over his head and filling it with helium.</p> \n<p>""I don't want to go through the very last throes of swelling up and drowning in my own blood. It is supposed to be a very ugly death when your aortic heart valve finally goes,"" Mitton told a local television station.</p> \n<p>Why shouldn't others in Maynard's terrible position, people like Robert Mitton, be able to make her choice? Why is it better for physician-assisted suicide to remain in the shadows?</p> \n<p>Legislators may come to different conclusions. Some might look at Oregon's data and decide that it's the wrong future for their own states. But the debate itself, about how we regulate death, is absolutely worth having.</p>"
The idea that milk prevents broken bones is an udder sham,http://www.vox.com/2014/11/3/7149943/the-idea-that-milk-prevents-broken-bones-is-an-udder-sham,"A big new study of more than 100,000 Swedes suggests this is absolutely false: it finds no correlation between stronger bones and milk consumption.","<p><span>One of milk's big sells — aside from being a nice complement to breakfast cereal — is that its high calcium-content helps build stronger bones. A big new study of more than 100,000 Swedes suggests this is absolutely false: it finds no correlation between stronger bones and milk consumption. </span></p> \n<p>The new research, <a href=""http://www.bmj.com/content/349/bmj.g6015?etoc="" target=""_blank"">published </a>British Medical Journal, examined whether consuming more dairy products correlated with longer life or fewer fractures. They used a 20-year data set of how much dairy tens of thousands of Swedish people consumed daily.</p> \n<p>Most of what they learned about milk was not good news. They found that, in both women and men, higher milk consumption correlated with higher rates of death. And in women, those who consumed more milk were also <i>more </i>likely to have fractured a bone, not less.</p> \n<p>The research follows on <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12540414"" target=""_blank"">another large 2005 study</a>, of more than 70,000 nurses, which also showed milk to have no protective benefit against fractures and a separate review, also published in 2005, that found ""scant evidence"" to support ""dairy product intake for promoting adolescent bone mineralization.""</p> \n<p>Taken together, most of the evidence does seem to stack up against milk as a way to prevent broken bones. But is consuming milk actively harmful? The new, Swedish study did, after all, find higher death rates and more broken bones among those who consumed more dairy products. And they argue that could be the fault of lactose, which in some research has been shown to be harmful to health.</p> \n<p>There is less evidence on this point and, as obesity expert Yoni Freedhoff<a href=""http://www.pcrm.org/health/diets/vegdiets/health-concerns-about-dairy-products"" target=""_blank""> argues</a>, one correlational study probably should not be enough to write off milk altogether.

A new study shows why cancer screening can be bad for your health,http://www.vox.com/2014/11/6/7167343/new-study-shows-why-cancer-screening-can-be-bad-for-your-health,An epidemic of thyroid cancer diagnoses in South Korea didn't actually actually reduce the death rate from the disease.,"<p>In 1999, South Korea launched an ambitious campaign to improve health by finding and treating diseases like cancer. Part of this effort included a state-subsidized, mass screening program. <br><br>In two decades, the number of South Koreans diagnosed with thyroid cancer rose fifteenfold.<br><br>At first glance, this seemed like a great success. But while South Korea managed to diagnose many more patients with the disease, the country didn't actually succeed at its mission: improving health. <br><br>Thyroid-cancer deaths remained stubbornly stable as the incidence of the disease skyrocketed. The additional screenings were leading to many more cases, but those additional diagnoses — and the invasive courses of treatment that came along with them — weren't making thyroid cancer any less deadly.<b><br></b></p> \n<h3>Cancer screening may actually do more harm than good</h3> \n<p>How  do you get a message across that something you always thought was good  for you — say, broccoli or exercise — is actually really bad for you,  and could potentially make you very sick?<br><br>This is the question Dr. <a href=""https://geiselmed.dartmouth.edu/faculty/facultydb/view.php?uid=74"" target=""_blank"">Gilbert Welch</a>, a physician and researcher at Dartmouth's school of medicine, has been asking himself for years about cancer screening. <br><br>Over a decade ago, he began looking into the effects of mass screening programs that have  emerged around the globe. These take otherwise healthy people and  subject them to tests to find out whether they have lumps and bumps that  may be malignant.<br><br>He found something disturbing: in many cases, screening wasn't  actually helping people or saving lives. <br><br><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""center"">thyroid-cancer related death rates held constant, even as the number of diagnoses skyrocketed</q><br>His latest study of thyroid-cancer screening in South Korea, just published with Korean colleagues in the <a target=""new"" href=""http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp1409841"">New England Journal of Medicine</a>, adds yet more fodder for his crusade to make healthy people think twice about getting screened. <br><br>It shows what appears to be an epidemic of overdiagnosis in South Korea: lots more people were told they have thyroid cancer, but no more lives were saved. If screening programs worked as intended, more diagnoses would correlate with fewer deaths.<br><br>The chart below illustrates how that's not happening. As you can see, it looks as if there’s a surge in thyroid cancer in    South Korea, yet the related death rate has held constant. ""There is nothing like it in the world,"" Welch said of the astronomical rise.</p> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""2434356"" alt=""thyroid"" src=""http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2434356/thyroid_chart.0.jpg""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">(Chart courtesy of the <a target=""new"" href=""http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp1409841"">New England Journal of Medicine</a>)</p> \n<p>In the US, during the same  period, diagnoses of thyroid cancer <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/06/health/study-warns-against-overdiagnosis-of-thyroid-cancer.html"">more than doubled</a>, but we also had a death rate that remained stable.<br><br> In South Korea, the reason for the surge in diagnoses is simple and   it  has nothing to do with biology or the environment: over the last    twenty years, doctors there started looking more closely for thyroid    cancer, a side-effect of the national screening  program launched in 1999.</p> \n<h3>An ""epidemic of diagnoses"" in South Korea</h3> \n<p>Though  thyroid ultrasounds  weren't included in the state-funded screening campaign, doctors began  promoting them as an  inexpensive additional test while patients were getting  screened anyway.<br><br>Right around that time, South Korean researchers started to note the ""<a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/06/opinion/an-epidemic-of-thyroid-cancer.html"" target=""_blank"">an epidemic of diagnosis</a>,"" as Welch calls it, where the rate of thyroid cancer grew faster than any cancer, anywhere in the world. <br><br>They   were seeing more and more cases, more and more cancer patients.  These  folks were getting invasive surgeries. ""Any time  you have a massive  increase in diagnosis, you tend to have a  massive  increase in  treatment, and all of our treatments have some  harms,"" explained Welch.  <br><br>Some were having their  thyroids removed, and were being  put on lifelong hormone medications. ""Some  had vocal chord paralysis  from the operations,"" said Welch. ""There is  also death associated with  the operation.""<br><br>But again, all this treatment wasn't actually  saving lives.  ""So not  only is it scary for people, and does it label  people as  having a  feared disease, but they end up getting unneeded  treatments.""<br><br>This finding shouldn't really be news. Since 1947, the medical  community has had evidence that, while common, thyroid cancer is rarely a  cause of death and that at least one third of adults can have small  thyroid cancers that are harmless.</p> \n<h3>""Overdiagnosis"" in thyroid cancer — and many others<br>\n</h3> \n<p>Welch and his colleagues use the term ""over-diagnosis"" to refer to the diagnoses of cancers that would not have been fatal or  even harmful. These are diagnoses that turned healthy people into cancer patients  unnecessarily, leading them to unnecessary treatment and  hospitalization,  creating clubs of ""cancer survivors"" who actually  would have lived even  if their cancers were left in them.</p> \n<p>Mass screening of healthy people is notably different from using   technologies like ultrasounds to diagnose people at risk of a disease   or who have symptoms that require investigation.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""right"">""When you use a  powerful technology to screen for lung cancer, it looks like smokers and non-smokers have [the same cancer rate].""</q>And not all mass screening is bad. Colorectal-cancer screening, for  example, has been shown to save lives as a result of early detection,  and the Pap test transformed cervical cancer into a treatable disease. <br><br>Still,  Welch has found evidence of overdiagnosis in breast and kidney  cancers, as well as melanoma. Population-based  screening for prostate cancer has been scaled back after the realization  that most men will die with, not of, the disease.<br><br>Welch even found overdiagnosis in lung cancer. ""That's the wildest one,""  he said. ""We all think of lung cancer as being the most  aggressive and  of course it can be.""<br><br>But overdiagnosed lung cancer has been documented since the early 1980s. ""The most powerful example of population-based screening was in Japan, where they started using spiral CT scanning to do mass screening and found the same rate of  cancer in smokers as non-smokers."" <br><br>For the past 50 years, we have known that smokers are at a 20- to 30-times greater risk of dying from lung cancer. ""When you use a very powerful technology to screen for lung cancer, it looks like smokers and non-smokers  are about the same.""</p> \n<h3>How to avoid being a victim of overdiagnosis</h3> \n<p>In the US, Welch said harmless thyroid cancers are also being overdiagnosed often in the process of looking for something else. This usually happens when someone gets a chest CT scan or an ultrasound of the neck to evaluate their carotid artery (the blood vessel that supplies the brain). ""These exams are meant to find  things that might be relevant to stroke, for example, but the thyroid is right there and a lot of surprise cancers are found that  way.""<br><br>The South Korean experience, Welch said, should be a cautionary tale for the rest of the world, since many countries — including Canada, the US, Australia, China, France and Italy — have recorded a jump in thyroid-cancer incidence and no increase in related mortality in recent years.</p> \n<p><br><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""center"">""All  the forces line up to support early cancer detection""</q><br>""The South Korean experience suggests that these countries are seeing just the tip of the thyroid-cancer iceberg — and that if they want to prevent their own 'epidemic,' they will need to discourage early thyroid-cancer detection,"" Welch and his colleagues wrote in their study.<br><br>To avoid being the victim of overdiagnosis, Welch suggests people talk to their doctors about their individual risks before getting screened. The <a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/BasicOneColumn/28"" target=""_blank"">US Preventive Services Task Force</a>, which examines the evidence and makes recommendations about mass cancer-screening programs, is also an excellent resource. (When the Task Force <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK15464/"" target=""_blank"">looked at the evidence</a>, it recommended against mass screening of asymptomatic people for thyroid cancer since there was a ""lack of evidence"" that early detection improves outcomes.)<br><br>Getting the message across that not all cancer is deadly, and finding it early can actually do more harm than good, hasn't been easy, Welch said. <br><br>""All  the forces line up to support early cancer detection,"" he explained. ""On first  inspection it makes total sense, it's so intuitively appealing. And then  the more people who are diagnosed with thyroid cancer, who have their  thyroids taken out, and who are doing well — other than the fact that  they're on medications or may have vocal-chord paralysis — the more they are seen as  survivors.""</p>"

There's no federal law, for example, that requires all companies to offer health benefits to their employees' same-sex partners. And the CAP report argues that some individuals could miss out on coverage, too, as ""anti-LGBT bias in hiring [may] push many LGBT people into unemployment or low-wage <span>jobs that do not offer benefits such as health insurance coverage.""</span></p> \n<p>As a result, only 38 percent of LGBT people under 400 percent of the poverty line have an offer of insurance through either their own or their spouse's employer. Among the general population, that number stands at 58 percent.</p> \n<p>And even within the LGBT community, there's widespread disparities in coverage rates. Gay and bisexual individuals have higher insured rates than lesbian women. And the uninsured rate among transgender <span>populations is especially high.

An organ shortage is killing people. Are lab-grown organs the answer?,http://www.vox.com/2014/11/20/7252365/lab-grown-organs,Some people are already walking around with lab-grown organs inside them.,"<p>The medical need for organ transplants far outstrips our supply, and the gap is only getting worse. One possible solution may be to grow custom-made organs for people out of their own cells.</p> \n<p>It may sound crazy, but it's already happening. Humans are currently walking around with artificial bladders, urethras, windpipes, and vaginas — all grown from their own cells in a laboratory.</p> \n<p>Advances in the basic biology of how these cells normally grow and develop in the body, combined with technological advances in materials and fabrication, have led to a boom in research within the past decade or so. And today, many top universities have labs dedicated to engineering tissues and organs.</p> \n<p>""When we started out in the field about 25 years ago, a lot of this was considered science fiction,"" says Anthony Atala, of the Wake Forest School of Medicine, who's a real leader in this area. ""Then the field exploded, of course, as soon as there were a few successes.""</p> \n<p>However, some body parts are far more difficult to make than others. The relatively simple tube of the urethra is nothing compared to the liver or the kidney's complex architecture, with various cell types all working together to do some fairly complex things. So far, scientists haven't demonstrated that they can make something as complicated as a liver work inside a person. (We still rely on organ donors for those.) But they're certainly working on it.</p> \n<p>Here's what you need to know about lab-grown organs:</p> \n<h3>The need for more organs is real, and growing</h3> \n<p><img src=""http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2472282/gapgraph.0.jpg""></p> \n<p> </p> \n<p class=""caption"">The US's organ donation statistics show a pretty clear trend. (<a href=""http://www.organdonor.gov/about/data.html"" target=""_blank"">Organdonor.gov</a>)</p> \n<p> </p> \n<p>The gray skyrocketing line on this graph is the number of patients waiting for organ donations in the US: more than 120,000 people. And about 18 people in the US <a href=""http://www.organdonor.gov/about/data.html"">die</a> each day because they haven't received a donation. (By the way, note that there are more transplants than donors here — likely because one donor can provide multiple organs, especially if the donor is deceased.)</p> \n<p>Obviously one way to help fix the shortfall would be to get more people to <a href=""http://www.organdonor.gov/becomingdonor/index.html"">sign up</a> to be donors. But even organ donation isn't a perfect system. For one, the body will naturally react against tissue from someone else. The body is very good at sensing and attacking foreign invaders, and this includes organs from other people. Although doctors match organs as carefully as they can, based on blood type and other biological factors, the body's foreigner-detection system is so sophisticated that it can generally tell that something's not quite right.</p> \n<p>This problem is called ""<a href=""http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000815.htm"">rejection</a>,"" and it's a major issue with organ transplants. Many patients have to be on drugs that suppress their immune systems for the rest of their lives in order to stop their bodies from attacking their transplanted organ.</p> \n<p>This is one reason why many scientists are interested in an alternative strategy: making replacement organs out of a patient's own cells. There's no risk of rejection when you're your own organ donor.</p> \n<h3>Some simpler lab-grown organs already exist</h3> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""2474664"" alt=""Atala Urine tube"" src=""http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2474664/seeded_scaffold.0.jpg""></p> \n<p> </p> \n<p class=""caption"">A lab-engineered urine tube. (Wake Forest School of Medicine)</p> \n<p> </p> \n<p>Researchers have already started giving some patients organs made out of their very own cells. Although these aren't necessarily the most complicated organs around, it's a promising start.</p> \n<p>In 2006, Anthony Atala's group at Wake Forest School of Medicine published a <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16631879"">paper</a> in the <i>Lancet</i> describing how they had made <a href=""http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/4871540.stm"">bladders</a> for seven patients out of their cells, and the patients had been doing very well after five years of observation.</p> \n<p>And research in this area continues to accelerate. In 2011, surgeons in Sweden gave a man with cancer the first <a href=""http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-14047670"">windpipe</a> made out of a patient's own cells. Several others have received similar lab-grown windpipes since.</p> \n<p>That same year, Atala's group announced that they had <a href=""http://www.bbc.com/news/health-12666171"">created</a> artificial urethras for five boys who had damaged theirs (again, from the patients' own cells). All five were doing well.</p> \n<p>And, more recently, in April of 2014, Atala's group published a <a href=""http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2814%2960542-0/fulltext"">paper</a> showing that they had successfully implanted lab-grown vaginas in four female teenagers whose vaginas never formed normally. Scientists grew the organs using cells from the patients' vulva tissue. Then, they surgically implanted the vaginas and attached them to the patients' healthy uteruses. Over the following years, the women were able to regain normal function, including menstruation and sex.</p> \n<h3>How to make an organ in the lab</h3> \n<p><iframe width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/Rjj4qq5Ywy8"" frameborder=""0""></iframe></p> \n<p> </p> \n<p> </p> \n<p class=""caption"">Click to watch the rat lung inflate and deflate in the lab. (<a target=""_blank"" href=""http://ottlab.mgh.harvard.edu/?page_id=55"">Ott Lab, Center for Regenerative Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital</a>)</p> \n<p> </p> \n<p>Techniques vary, but they tend to have a similar strategy (note, this includes many experimental methods that have yet to be tried out in people):</p> \n<p><b>1) Scan the patient's organ.</b> Sometimes researchers first scan the patient's body to determine exactly what size and shape their existing organ is. This allows them to make a replacement that perfectly matches those parameters. For example, you'd probably want a new windpipe that fits your throat.</p> \n<p><b>2) Create a scaffold. </b>The scaffold is in the shape of the organ and will give the cells something to grow on. Sometimes researchers do this by reusing the natural scaffolding of a natural organ. They'll take a donor organ and dissolve all the cells until nothing is left but the dead structural material. Other times, they'll create the scaffold from scratch, using things like <a href=""http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/11/24/print-thyself"">3D printing</a> and other techniques to generate its intricate shape.</p> \n<p><b>3) Add cells.</b> Ideally, these cells come from the patient. Sometimes they will be able to get the right cell type straight from the patient. And in other research, they'll use precursor cells, such as stem cells, which scientists then direct to become what they need by providing the right molecules in their environment.</p> \n<p><b>4) Put it in a bioreactor. </b>This is a fancy name for a body-temperature environment with plenty of oxygen and food and everything else the cells need to grow and multiply. Cells can create an organ fairly quickly. For example, human bladders take several weeks.</p> \n<h3>One obstacle? Cells can be very picky</h3> \n<p><img src=""http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2474698/RS091213-088_hirez.0.jpg"" alt=""Wake Forest scientist"" data-chorus-asset-id=""2474698""></p> \n<p> </p> \n<p class=""caption"">A doctoral student uses an organ bath system to evaluate engineered muscle. (Wake Forest School of Medicine)</p> \n<p> </p> \n<p>A key step in making artificial organs is being able to grow various kinds of human cells in a laboratory. And for a long time, this was a major hurdle. (It still is for some types.)</p> \n<p>Each specialized type of cell in your body needs certain chemical clues from its environment in order to thrive and multiply. And even a simple-seeming body part, like a urethra, requires more than one cell type, arranged in certain ways relative to one another.</p> \n<p>Cells also need the right kinds of structures to climb on and stick to. And some need to feel appropriate kinds of <a href=""http://m.nautil.us/issue/12/feedback/this-iconoclast-injected-life-into-artificial-body-parts"">physical forces</a> from their environments, as well. Researchers have done a ton of work painstakingly figuring many of these signals out. ""It was all very basic biology,"" says Atala.</p> \n<p>Sometimes researchers need to use stem cells rather than adult cells. And in that case, they need to figure out how to tell these cells to become what they need. A major factor now allowing this research to flourish is basic research into what kinds of environmental cues tell the body to produce certain types of cells in the womb.</p> \n<h3>Kidneys are needed the most, but they're really difficult to make</h3> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""2474720"" alt=""Atala kidney printer"" src=""http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2474720/integrated_printer.0.jpg""></p> \n<p> </p> \n<p class=""caption"">Printing a prototype kidney.

They've put lab-grown <a href=""http://www.nature.com/news/lab-grown-kidneys-transplanted-into-rats-1.12791"">kidneys</a> in rats and lab-grown <a href=""http://phenomena.nationalgeographic.com/2010/06/24/lungs-rebuilt-in-lab-and-transplanted-into-rats/"">lungs</a> and tiny ""<a href=""http://www.nature.com/news/miniature-human-liver-grown-in-mice-1.13324"">liver buds</a>"" in mice. (However, these organs don't necessarily work as well as the real thing or last all that long.)</p> \n<p>And scaling up is a huge hurdle. The bigger the organ, the more blood vessels it needs to get nourishment all throughout the cells hidden inside. And this includes capillaries — blood vessels smaller than a human hair. Making those isn't easy, but researchers are using various techniques, including 3D printing, to create those exceptionally tiny but vitally important features. The key to going big is going small.</p>"

The myth of the food hangover,http://www.vox.com/2014/11/28/7259709/the-myth-of-the-food-hangover,You're probably just experiencing indigestion.,"<p>In the hours after Thanksgiving, you're lying down on the sofa in a glazed state and with a heavy stomach. It's almost as if you've drank too much, except you didn't drink at all. You just ate. A lot.<br><br>The concept of the ""food hangover"" has been floated in recent years: it refers to the hangover-like after-effects of eating a big meal rich in salt, sugar and fat: sleepiness, lethargy, thirstiness. In other words, it describes the way many feel after Thanksgiving. But is there any science to it?<br><br>At Vox, we tried to search for studies that could explain the food hangover. While there's lots of<a href=""http://www.wired.com/2014/05/hangover-cure/""> research on hangovers from drinking too much</a>, there doesn't seem to be a single study about an equivalent phenomenon caused by too much food.<br><br>We called health-myth debunker Dr. Aaron Carroll, of the Indiana University School of Medicine, to learn more. Here's what he had to say.</p> \n<p><b>Julia Belluz: ""Food hangovers:"" are they real?</b><br><br>Aaron Carroll: I  haven't seen any research. I  think it's just not  considered a ""thing"" like with alcohol. Is it really any different     than ""indigestion""? And it doesn't seem to take until the next morning     to show up.</p> \n<p><b>JB: But people, after they overeat, say they experience this. What's going on?</b><br><br>AC: I don't think many people distinguish too well between the concept of a food hangover and indigestion. If you eat too much, you don't feel well right away.</p> \n<p><b>JB: What's happening to your body after you overeat?</b><br><br>AC: Your body is trying to absorb as much as possible from all the food. It's an overload. There are hormones in your body, when you're hungry and need food. These hormones kick in to make you stop eating. Those hormones telling you to stop are in overload. At the same time, your gastrointestinal tract has various ways of letting you know it’s not comfortable, that you put too much into it. So it’s your body saying ""stop.""</p> \n<p><b>JB: What about the tiredness. You know, the classic scene on Thanksgiving, people passing out on the sofa with their belts unfastened.</b><br><br>AC: Some people theorize blood is being drawn away from other parts of our body to your gastrointestinal tract. When you’ve had enough to eat, your body wants to slow down and concentrate on digestion. Some people complain they feel sleepier after meals, but this is not happening to everybody. Again, it's one of those areas that doesn't have a ton of research behind it.</p> \n<p><b>JB: During the holidays, how can people avoid the food hangover... or whatever you'd call it?</b><br><br>AC: Just like a real hangover: prevention, moderation.</p>"
Why gynecologists think IUDs are the best contraceptive,http://www.vox.com/2014/11/24/7272485/iud-birth-control-facts,"Intrauterine devices (IUDs) are amazingly, fantastically good at preventing pregnancy â€” but only 8.5 percent of birth control users have one.","<p>Intrauterine devices (IUDs) are amazingly, fantastically good at preventing pregnancy — better than pretty much any other available contraceptive.</p> \n<p>Birth control pills, which have to be taken regularly, are susceptible to human error. The pill has a<a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/reproductivehealth/UnintendedPregnancy/PDF/Contraceptive_methods_508.pdf"" target=""_blank""> 6 percent failure rate</a>. So out of 1,000 women taking birth control pills, 60 will become pregnant in a typical year. Among women who use an IUD, that number will be between 2 and 8 (depending on the type of IUD they use).</p> \n<p>The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists<a href=""http://www.acog.org/Resources-And-Publications/Committee-Opinions/Committee-on-Gynecologic-Practice/Increasing-Use-of-Contraceptive-Implants-and-Intrauterine-Devices-To-Reduce-Unintended-Pregnancy"" target=""_blank""> recommends</a> IUDs and the contraceptive implant (<a href=""http://bedsider.org/methods/implant#details_tab"" target=""_blank"">the one other long-acting, reversible contraceptive</a>) as a ""first-line"" contraceptive that should be ""encouraged as an option for most women.""</p> \n<p>It should be no surprise, then, that IUD use has hugely increased in recent years.<a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhsr/nhsr086.pdf""> New federal data</a> show that the use of long-acting contraceptives, like IUDs and the birth control implant, has quadrupled since 2002.</p> \n<p>An estimated 11.6 percent of American women now use long-acting, reversible contraceptives like IUDs. Still, the devices tend to get an especially bad rap in the United States because of the Dalkon Shield, an early IUD from the 1970s. It was hard to insert (<a href=""http://www.case.edu/affil/skuyhistcontraception/online-2012/dalkon-sheild.jpg"">it looked like this</a>), sometimes failed to prevent pregnancy, <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/1987/12/06/magazine/the-sad-legacy-of-the-dalkon-shield.html"">injured as many as 200,000 women</a>, and sometimes led to infertility or even death. All in all, it was a terrible contraceptive that was subsequently pulled from the market.</p> \n<p>Today's IUDs are different: They're safer, easier to insert, and incredibly effective. That probably explains why <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/doctor-preferred-birth-control"" target=""_blank"">40 percent </a>of gynecologists using a contraceptive are using IUDs — way more than the general population. Here are a few of the most common questions about how they work, answered. If there are some we missed, feel free to email me <a href=""http://sarah.kliff@vox.com"">here</a>.</p> \n<h3>1) How do IUDs work?</h3> \n<div class=""align-right""> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""2485690"" alt=""iud"" src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2485690/iud.0.png""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">An ultrasound of an IUD in its natural habitat, the uterus.</p> \n</div> \n<p>IUDs make the uterus an incredibly hostile, inhospitable, sad place to be a sperm — which prevents a sperm from getting anywhere close to an egg.</p> \n<p>This is true for the two types of IUDs, copper and hormonal — although the way they work is a little bit different.</p> \n<p>Paragard, the copper IUD, ""releases copper ions in a steady, slow fashion so that the uterine cavity is bathed in those copper ions,"" said Laura MacIsaac, director of the family planning program at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York. She also helps the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists develop policy on birth control methods.</p> \n<p>The copper ions, she explained, ""kill the sperm. It's almost like a barrier method, like a condom, that keeps the sperm from getting any further than the uterus.""</p> \n<p>I asked MacIsaac if this was something akin to the IUD creating a force field around the uterus, and she said that was a pretty fair analogy. So if that helps you think about how an IUD works (or if, like me, the concept of a uterine force field amuses you), you're welcome.</p> \n<p>Mirena and Skyla, the two hormonal IUDs, use a hormone called levonorgestrel to do something similar. ""Levonorgestrel thickens the cervical mucus, which is the first step to sperm getting through the cervix [and then to the uterus],"" MacIsaac said. ""It also makes the whole lining of the uterine cavity very thin and unfriendly for sperm transport.""</p> \n<p>One other key difference between all the three IUDs available in the United States is how long they work. The copper IUD is effective for 12 years, while Mirena and Skyla last five and three years, respectively.</p> \n<h3>2) How is an IUD inserted?</h3> \n<p>It's done in four steps that take about five minutes.</p> \n<p>Step one is pretty much like a typical pelvic exam that happens at a regular checkup. With the patient's feet in stirrups, the doctor inserts a speculum into the vagina.</p> \n<div class=""align-right""> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2485706/paragard.0.png"" alt=""paragard"" data-chorus-asset-id=""2485706""></p> \n<p class=""caption""> </p> \n<p class=""caption"">Paragard, the copper IUD. (Paragard)</p> \n</div> \n<p><span></span>Step two is where the health care provider straightens out the cervical canal to create an easy path for inserting the IUD. This is done using a clamp called a tenaculum to hold on to the cervix. MacIsaac said this usually feels like a ""pinch"" and can be similar in pain to a menstrual cramp.</p> \n<p>Step three involves measuring the size and angle of the uterus, to make sure that the IUD stays put after it's inserted. To do this, the provider, with the tenaculum still holding the cervix straight, inserts a straw-size rod into the uterus. This is called ""sounding"" the uterus, and providers do it to ""know how far you have to go in order to insert the device,"" said Vanessa Cullins, vice president for medical affairs at Planned Parenthood.</p> \n<p>The final step is inserting the IUD itself. The measuring rod comes out of the cervix, and another rod that contains the device goes in. The health care provider uses this rod to position the IUD in the cervix and then leave it there.</p> \n<p>That, in four steps, is how IUDs find their uterine homes. You can watch an animated video of the process <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgi3mbW2YdA"">here</a>, if that's the kind of thing you're into.</p> \n<h3>3) How do I choose the right IUD?</h3> \n<p>Probably in consultation with your health care provider. But here's a quick chart comparing the differences between the three IUDs available in the United States.</p> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""2482980"" alt=""iud chart"" src=""https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2482980/iud_chart.0.png"">The big difference between IUDs is mostly their mechanism of action — whether they use copper or hormones to prevent pregnancy — and how long they last. Both have low failure rates, although hormonal IUDs have the lower failure rate of the two.</p> \n<h3>4) Does getting an IUD hurt?</h3> \n<p>The frustrating answer here is that it depends. Some women say it hurts a lot; others barely feel a thing.</p> \n<p>""I've seen such a huge range,"" said MacIsaac. ""I've done both ones where people are like, 'I don't feel anything,' and others where people say they feel like they're going to throw up because it hurts so much.""</p> \n<p>There is one study of Swedish women who had never before given birth and had an IUD inserted. It found 9 percent experienced ""no pain,"" 72 percent said it was ""moderately painful"" and 17 percent said it was ""severely painful."" And, for what it's worth, four months after the insertion, 5 percent said they were dissatisfied with their new method of birth control.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""center"">In one study, 72 percent of women said getting an IUD was ""moderately painful""</q></p> \n<p>In <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18821462"">a separate study</a>, about two-thirds of women rated the pain similar to the cramps they experienced during a menstrual cycle. Other surveys <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12885310"">have found </a>that women tend to anticipate IUD insertion to be more painful than the actual experience.</p> \n<p>A lot of providers will recommend taking an over-the-counter anti-inflammatory like Motrin or Advil an hour before the procedure. For patients who experience higher pain levels, MacIsaac sometimes administers a low dose of Valium.</p> \n<p>After insertion, women can expect to have cramps for about 24 hours or so. These are usually similar in pain level to menstrual cramps and subside after about a day.</p> \n<h3>5) Is there any chance I can get pregnant while I have an IUD?</h3> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2485708/shutterstock_131580971.0.jpg"" alt=""pregnant"" data-chorus-asset-id=""2485708""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">(Shutterstock)</p> \n<p>It's tiny, but, yes, there is chance. Of 1,000 women using Paragard (the copper IUD) typically eight will become pregnant in a given year. For 1,000 women using a hormonal IUD (either Mirena or Skyla), two will have IUDs that fail.</p> \n<p>This can happen for two reasons. There's the possibility that a woman could have an expulsion and not realize it. This is especially true for women using Paragard, who often experience heavy bleeding after insertion and heavier periods during the first few months or year.</p> \n<p>""The first two periods after Paragard you might have a blood clot the size of a half-dollar,"" said MacIsaac. ""So the IUD could fall out in the toilet, and you may not notice."" (We'll get to a way to prevent this in just a moment.)</p> \n<p><q class=""center"" aria-hidden=""true"">""There's, like, a billion sperm every time a man ejaculates, and they're really stubborn""</q></p> \n<p>And even if the IUD stays in, there's a  small chance that somehow, some way, a very persistent sperm will manage to still swim its way through the IUD's best defenses. Or as MacIsaac put it, ""There’s, like, a billion sperm every time a man ejaculates, and they’re really stubborn.""</p> \n<p>With the copper IUD, for example, there's that teeny, tiny chance that the copper ions that block sperm from entering the uterus left a tiny bit uncovered. And a sperm happened to make its way to the egg.</p> \n<p>To repeat, this is rare. But it does happen, even when a doctor has inserted an IUD perfectly.</p> \n<h3>6) What are the possible risks of an IUD?</h3> \n<p>Expulsions and perforations are the two main complications. Both are rare and perforations are a much more serious problem.</p> \n<p>Expulsions happen when the body pushes the IUD out of the uterus. This can happen if health care provider doesn't  insert the device correctly — or, even if it is placed correctly, the uterus becomes irritated with the foreign object and rejects it.</p> \n<p>The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists estimates that IUDs have an expulsion rate between<a href=""http://www.acog.org/Resources-And-Publications/Committee-Opinions/Committee-on-Adolescent-Health-Care/Adolescents-and-Long-Acting-Reversible-Contraception#34""> 3 and 5 percent</a>.</p> \n<p>Expulsions aren't necessarily dangerous to the body, although women may feel some discomfort and cramping if the IUD starts to come out of the uterus and through the cervix.</p> \n<p>""Whenever the uterus is trying to expel something, whether that's a baby, or menstrual blood, or an IUD, it cramps,"" said Cullins.</p> \n<p>The biggest risk factor of an expulsion is pregnancy: Women become fertile within about a day of their IUD coming out.</p> \n<p>Perforations<b> </b>occur when the IUD punctures the uterine wall. This can be incredibly dangerous, possibly damaging the nearby bladder or intestine. If left untreated, perforations can lead to hemorrhaging or sepsis. <b> </b></p> \n<p>Perforations are extremely rare, much rarer than expulsions. The largest study on uterine perforations, conducted in 2007 on more than 60,000 European women, found<a href=""http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/results/NCT00461175?sect=X70156#outcome1""> a perforation rate of 0.1</a> percent for both hormonal and copper IUDs.</p> \n<p>There are no known long-term health risks of IUD use. The IUD does not have any effect on long-term fertility; women can typically become pregnant within one day of having the device removed. And some research has actually shown IUDs could have a protective effect, as users have lower rates of gynecological cancers.</p> \n<h3>7) Who should get an IUD?</h3> \n<p>The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends IUDs for the vast majority of women who are sexually active, of reproductive age, and who do not want to become pregnant. They are the ""most effective forms of reversible contraception available and are safe for use by almost all reproductive-age women.""</p> \n<p><q class=""left"" aria-hidden=""true"">Gynecologists recommend IUDS for all reproductive-age women</q></p> \n<p>ACOG's recommendation mostly comes down to efficacy: IUDS are just way better at preventing pregnancy than nearly any other contraceptive. (The only thing with a lower error rate is the birth control implant,<a target=""_blank"" href=""http://bedsider.org/methods/implant#details_tab""> which you can read more about here</a>.) There's no space to screw up the IUD like there is with birth control rings, patches, and pills that have to be taken at regular intervals.</p> \n<p>As ACOG points out, ""More than half of women who have an unplanned pregnancy were using contraception. ... [IUDs] have the highest continuation rates of all reversible contraceptives, a key factor in contraceptive successes.""</p> \n<p>The one group of people who should not get IUDs is those who have an untreated sexually transmitted infection (STI). Infections can lead to a higher risk of pelvic infection when the device is inserted. This is why many providers will do an STI test at the time of insertion.</p> \n<h3>8) Do I need to do anything after the IUD is in?</h3> \n<p>Not much — but there are a few things MacIsaac recommends to patients. For starters, no unprotected sex for two weeks after insertion. That's because right after the IUD is inserted, there's a higher risk that any sexually contracted disease could travel up into the uterus and become a pelvic infection. But after about two weeks, that risk goes away.</p> \n<p>MacIsaac also has patients check whether they can feel the string from their IUD for first six months or so after insertion. This is the string that she will eventually use to remove the IUD, and it typically can be felt by the patient where it hangs just below the cervix. The reason she has patients check for the string is to make sure the IUD hasn't fallen out accidentally, which doesn't usually happen — but if it does, it tends to be shortly after insertion.</p> \n<p>And if they can't feel the string, it's not an immediate cause for panic. ""Many women aren't able to reach their cervix, or the strings are tucked up behind it,"" MacIsaac said. ""If after a few months they can't feel them, they can come in and we'll do an ultrasound to make sure it's still there.""</p> \n<h3>9) Can I or my partner feel an IUD during sex?</h3> \n<p>Not if it's situated correctly. But if the IUD is falling out during an expulsion, it's possible that a woman or her partner could feel it during intercourse or other sexual activities — and that would be reason to head back to the doctor for a visit.</p>"

Indoor smoking bans followed in the 1990s.</p> \n<p>At the same time, cigarette prices rose rapidly as states added excise taxes.

One study showed that food diarizers <a href=""http://www.ajpmonline.org/article/S0749-3797%2808%2900374-7/abstract"" target=""_blank"">lost twice the amount</a> of those who didn't track. <br><br>Counting calories helps people to be more mindful about what they're eating, when they are eating too much, and where they might be going wrong, they said.<br><br>Almost as soon as I published the piece, however, I heard from readers who thought that tracking their food intake was much easier said than done.<br><br>Or, as one coworker put it: ""How do I log the three bites of chocolate banana cake that was on the Vox kitchen counter this morning?""</p> \n<p><b><i>Read more: </i><i><a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/11/27/7289565/weight-loss-diet-tips"" target=""_blank"">Surprisingly simple tips from 20 experts about how to lose weight and keep it off</a></i> </b><i><b>and <a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/obesity-weight-loss-diet/what-is-obesity"" target=""_blank""><i>Everything you wanted to know about weight loss and obesity</i></a></b><i><br></i></i><br>Another noted that she often starts tracking, but then gives up when she eats out; calculating a restaurant meal is too difficult.<br><br>I went back to the experts to see what advice they had about how best to track. Here's a quick summary of what they told me:</p> \n<h3>1) Stop trying to be perfect</h3> \n<p>Calorie counting, while important, does not always have to be a perfect science.<br><br>""I am not crazy exact about counting calories,"" said <a href=""http://www.drsharma.ca/about"">Dr. Arya Sharma</a>, director of the Canadian Obesity Network. ""I recommend caloric awareness. You just need to be somewhere in the ballpark, it's nothing to obsess about.""</p> \n<p>On the face of it, this seemed to contradict the message that knowing exactly what's going into your body is extremely important when it comes to weight loss and maintenance.</p> \n<p>But the doctors were trying to say that, realistically, no one is going to be able to tally perfectly the nutrition content of every bite, every day. Keeping some kind of food diary — even if you don't get the calorie total exactly right — helps people to be more careful about what they're consuming. Imperfect tracking is better than none at all. When done over a long period, it might even change how you eat. <br><br>""Just guessing maintains thoughtfulness and reminds a person of all of the changes they’re trying to make,"" said obesity physician and <i>Diet Fix</i> author <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/The-Diet-Fix-Diets-Yours/dp/0804137579"">Dr. Yoni Freedhoff</a>.<br><br><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""center"">""A food diary is simply a source of information to help inform   your decisions""</q><span><br>As I wrote in </span><a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/11/27/7289565/weight-loss-diet-tips"" style=""font-size: 17.7777786254883px; background-color: #ffffff;"">last week's feature</a><span>, I once had to lose nearly 30 pounds and tracking helped give me a good sense of what I was eating. I'm by no means perfect, but I logged for long enough to know the nutrition makeup of most of the foods I regularly eat, so now I'm often tracking in my head. <br><br>Whenever I feel I'm not being careful enough, I use an app for an extra nudge (more on that later). I don't aim for perfection or fret when I miss a meal or even a day. The mere act of tracking helps me stay focused and better understand where my calories are coming from. </span><br><br>As <span><a href=""http://greatist.com/health/yoni-freedhoff-count-calories"" target=""_blank"">Dr. Freedhoff</a> has said, tracking shouldn't be punitive or judgmental: ""</span>A food diary is simply a source of information to help inform   your decisions, as well as an incredibly powerful habit-building tool.""<br><br> <img data-chorus-asset-id=""2513390"" alt=""chocolate"" src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2513390/459040956.0.jpg""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">How many calories in three bites of chocolate cake? (Photo by Tiziana Fabi/AFP/Getty Images)</p> \n<h3>2)  When dining out, assume the worst and use your hand to estimate portion sizes</h3> \n<p>Experts do have some tips for how to estimate in situations where calorie counts aren't available. The first: assume the worst.<br><br>""When  eating out, it's a good bet, even when choosing healthier options, that  you are going to eat more  calories  than you would at home,"" said  Katherine Zeratsky, a registered dietician at the Mayo Clinic.<br><br>The gurus all suggested over-estimating your calorie intake whenever you have a meal outside of the house.<br><br><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""center"">Add 40 percent to non-posted calorie counts for meals at restaurants</q><br>Dr. Freedhoff recommended adding 40 percent to non-posted calorie counts for meals at restaurants, and 20 percent to posted information (since studies have shown that restaurants often undervalue the actual calorie content of their foods).<br><br>Zeratsky  had some other helpful advice about counting: a portion of  lean meat or protein the size of a woman's palm is worth  about 200 calories. But, again, most restaurant portions are much  larger, and probably include <i>at least</i> 120 calories (or a tablespoon) of fat for cooking.<br><br>A  cup of starch — such as a pasta or potatoes — would be about the size of  a woman's fist. This would include 180 to 220 calories,  depending on sauces, fats, or other ingredients used during cooking. <br><br>Vegetables are very low  in calories, but again — Zeratsky said she'd add a minimum of 120 calories for cooking  fat (unless the greens were steamed).<br><br>As  for desserts, such as those found in the Vox kitchen: Zeratsky said it's safe to assume they contain about 25 to 50 calories per one tablespoon. ""Those three bites of decadent dessert,"" she said, ""could be 100 to 150  calories.""<br><br> <img data-chorus-asset-id=""2513394"" alt=""blueberries"" src=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2513394/459762086.0.jpg""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">(Photo by Frank Bienewald/LightRocket)</p> \n<h3>3) Use an app to track</h3> \n<p>""One of the mobile apps like <a href=""https://www.loseit.com/"" target=""_blank"">Lose It</a> can help,"" Dr. Lawrence Cheskin, director of the Johns Hopkins Weight Management Center, suggested.<br><br>The other weight loss gurus noted that apps have made tracking so much easier today than in the past, when calorie books and old-fashioned pen and paper tallying were the norm. <br><br>I have found MyFitnessPal to be  very useful: you can set reminders for when you've forgotten to  log a meal, and it saves the foods you eat frequently so once you've been using it for a while, it only takes a  few minutes to log each day.</p>"
"From condoms to defibrillators, the best stuff you can buy with leftover FSA dollars",http://www.vox.com/2014/12/3/7324939/fsa-how-to-spend,Who is excited to purchase tons and tons of ibuprofen?!,"<p>December is here, which means Christmas cheer, Hanukkah joy — and for some flexible health spending account holders, a mad rush to purchase medical supplies.</p> \n<p>Medical Flexible Spending Accounts (or FSAs) allow people who get health insurance at work to set aside part of their pre-tax paycheck (up to $2,500 annually) for health-care purchases. FSA dollars can be spent on doctor appointment co-pays and co-insurance. Or, they can be spent on lots of drugstore items that range from over-the-counter drugs (think painkillers and allergy medications) to less-medical-seeming items (sunscreen, contact solution, and condoms are all FSA-eligible).</p> \n<p>FSA dollars expire at the end of each year — I became acutely aware of this fact earlier this month, when I realized I had a decent amount left in my account. So I started to do some research: what could I buy with my leftover FSA dollars? Here are some of the greatest deals I discovered.</p> \n<h3></h3> \n<h3>Your goal: Never, ever purchase Advil again</h3> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2512600/shutterstock_59787397.0.jpg"" alt=""ibuprofen"" data-chorus-asset-id=""2512600""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Like this, except maybe 100 times more pills (Shutterstock)</p> \n<p><b>Your purchase:</b><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.amazon.com/Kirkland-Signature-Ibuprofen-200mg-2X500/dp/B0009RT5P0""><b> </b></a><a href=""http://www.drugstore.com/products/prod.asp?pid=369207&amp;catid=183124"" target=""_blank"">Ibuprofen jumbo pack</a><b>.</b> First things first: never buy Advil — the generic version works equally well. <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/7/25/5936739/shop-like-a-pharmacist-dont-buy-advil"">Pharmacists don't buy brand-name, over-the-counter medications, and you shouldn't either</a>. Second: you can use FSA dollars to buy unlimited amounts of over-the-counter medications, but you will need a doctor's prescription to do so. This is a relatively recent change to FSA regulations that<a href=""http://www.irs.gov/uac/Affordable-Care-Act:-Questions-and-Answers-on-Over-the-Counter-Medicines-and-Drugs""> took effect in 2011 and is part of Obamacare</a>. So before you go crazy stocking up on ibuprofen, or any other over-the-counter medication, keep in mind you're going to have to get your doctor's sign-off.</p> \n<h3>Your goal: stock up on something you'll definitely use, without a prescription</h3> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2512612/shutterstock_122062870.0.jpg"" alt=""Contact Solution"" data-chorus-asset-id=""2512612""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">In Oprah voice: ""You get contact solution!

Sunscreen, too, is another good option — although keep in mind sunscreen does tend to expire a little bit faster.</p> \n<h3>Your goal: Save your FSA dollars for next year</h3> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2512626/shutterstock_169652402.0.jpg"" alt=""shutterstock_169652402.0.jpg"" data-chorus-asset-id=""2512626""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">You cannot, sadly, use FSA dollars to buy the chocolate chips (Shutterstock)</p> \n<p><b>Your purchase: Some cookies for your HR department</b>. Companies do actually have some discretion to stretch FSA dollars into the new year. Federal regulations allow them to do two things. First, they can extend the spending period two and a half months until March 15, 2015. Second, they can allow employees to roll over a maximum of $500 into next year's account. While companies have the flexibility to make these accommodations, they are not required to — hence the cookies to bribe them.</p> \n<h3>Your goal: Get a Halloween costume for next year</h3> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2512630/shutterstock_74666299.0.jpg"" alt=""shutterstock_74666299.0.jpg"" data-chorus-asset-id=""2512630""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Just.

The long-acting contraceptive, meanwhile, is 20 times more effective at preventing pregnancy than condoms, which can be put on incorrectly and thus subject to human error.

A co-worker here at Vox told me about a friend who used leftover FSA dollars to buy defibrillators as Christmas gifts for his parents.

Birth control implants: The incredibly effective contraception that you've never heard of,http://www.vox.com/2014/12/4/7327607/birth-control-implant-facts,"The 4-centimeter device, inserted by a doctor into the arm, is far more effective than birth control pills and condoms at preventing pregnancy.","<p>Birth control control implants are, hands down, the most effective, non-permanent contraceptive.</p> \n<p>The 4-centimeter device, inserted by a doctor into the arm, is far more effective than birth control pills and condoms at preventing pregnancy — and even slightly better than other long-term contraceptives,<a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/11/24/7272485/iud-birth-control-facts""> such as IUDs</a>.

Birth control implants both work the best — but are used the least, and don't get talked about too much as a contraceptive option. The devices are a relatively new form of birth control and insertion requires special training on the part of a gynecologist.</p> \n<p>""IUDs have been around a whole lot longer than implants, that's a huge factor,"" says Jill Rabin, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Hofstra North Shore-LIJ School of Medicine. ""They're what doctors are used to, and recommend. Then there's also the fact that ob-gyns aren't trained to operate on arms, even though it's not difficult to do. It's an easy insertion, but also different from our typical work.""</p> \n<p>Rabin inserts both IUDs and implants regularly at her practice in Long Island. And I got to talk to her this week about birth control implants: how they work, what kind of side effects they have, and why so few women use them.</p> \n<h3>1) Birth control implants prevent pregnancy by delivering hormones to the blood stream</h3> \n<div class=""align-right""> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""2515172"" alt=""nexplanon"" src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2515172/nexplanon.0.png""></p> \n<p><span></span></p> \n<p class=""caption"">A birth control implant (the rod to the left of the bone) in its natural habitat, the arm (British Medical Journal)</p> \n</div> \n<p>Gynecologists typically use a birth control implant called <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.nexplanon.com/en/consumer/"">Nexplanon</a>, which is manufactured by pharmaceutical company Merck. Some also will use an older version of the implant called Implanon, the main difference between the two is that Nexplanon (a newer implant) is manufactured to show up in x-rays. Implanon isn't.</p> \n<p>Both of the implants contain 68 milligrams of etonogestrel that slowly get released during the device's three-year lifespan. This is actually the same hormone used in other contraceptives like Nuvaring, a contraceptive ring inserted into the vagina.</p> \n<p>The etonogesterel hormone makes the uterus a really sad, difficult place for a sperm to even get to — or, if a sperm does make it there, for it to fertilize an egg and create an embryo.</p> \n<p>""Because of the etonogesterel the cervical mucus gets thick and the lining of the uterus gets thin, which makes a fertilized egg not excited about implanting there,"" Rabin says .""Think about if you were a fertilized seed pod and you were looking for a place to settle to grow into a plant.""</p> \n<p>Landing in the uterus of an implant user is akin, as Rabin puts it, ""to landing on a rock rather than soil.""</p> \n<h3>2) Birth control implants take a few minutes to insert with a needle</h3> \n<div style=""text-align:center"">\n<img data-chorus-asset-id=""2515180"" alt=""applicator.0.png"" src=""https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2515180/applicator.0.png""> \n<p class=""caption"">The Nexplanon applicator (British Medical Journal)</p> \n</div> \n<p><span></span>The insertion process works like this: a gynecologist or other provider will measure eight centimeters up from the elbow and make a mark between the bicep and tricep muscles. That's where they'll poke a needle under the skin to insert the implant. They'll also make another mark four centimeters further up the arm, closer to the shoulder, which is where the implant should stop once inserted.</p> \n<p>""We clean the arm, and then numb it with lidocaine [an anesthetic],"" Rabin says. ""We put the tip of the needle in at the first mark at an angle, to tent up the skin. And then we basically use the inserted needle to deploy the device. Once you remove the needle, you have the applicator out and the implant under the skin.""</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""center"">implants prevent pregnancy in 99.95% of all cases — more than any other contraceptive</q></p> \n<p>Rabin checks the applicator afterwards to make sure that the implant is no longer there, and also the patient's arm, to ensure she can feel the device under the skin. Typically she can but, if not, ""we use an ultrasound to check. Almost 100 percent of the time it's right where we put it.""</p> \n<p>Because of the anesthetic, the insertion process shouldn't hurt. Merck does warn that insertion and removal of the implant do have the possible side effects of ""pain, irritation, swelling, bruising, scarring"" and other risks. And if you spend any time poking around on Google, you'll find images of women who show big bruise marks after implantation.</p> \n<p>There isn't a ton of research on this yet, but the studies that do exist suggest this is an atypical reaction. One <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3728804/"">2012 study</a> of 23 women receiving the birth control implant showed that 61% experienced minor discomfort at the insertion site that disappeared within a week. Doctors will typically put a pressure bandage over the insertion site, left there for a day or two after, to minimize the risk of a bruise.</p> \n<h3>3) Patients should be able to feel (and maybe even see) the implant under their skin</h3> \n<p>""You should definitely be able to feel it if you poke at your arm,"" Rabin says. ""Whether you can see the outline depends in part on your weight. Generally, if you're heavier with more fat tissue, you might not see it.""</p> \n<p>I asked Rabin whether she thought this was a barrier to some women using the implant — did the idea of seeing the outline of a tiny, rod inside their arm weird patients out? She says no.</p> \n<p><q class=""center"" aria-hidden=""true"">can't feel your birth control implant? go to the doctor.</q></p> \n<p>""I really think that's minor,"" Rabin says. ""The biggest barrier is having a provider who is trained, on board, and willing to take the time to do the procedure.""</p> \n<p>That being said, it is still possible that one reason women don't ask about the birth control implant in the first place is because they're not quite ready to see the outline of a foreign object in the side of their arm.</p> \n<h3>4) The most common side effect of the implant is irregular bleeding</h3> \n<p>Much more so than other contraceptives, the birth control implant causes high rates of irregular bleeding.</p> \n<p>The <a href=""http://www.drugs.com/pro/nexplanon.html"">best data available</a> about half of women using the implant will have infrequent bleeding, or no periods altogether. Another 20 percent or so will have heavy bleeding or irregular bleeding, more so than they did prior to the implant's insertion.</p> \n<p>Nobody know why, exactly, this happens at such high levels with the implant. ""The mechanism of irregular cycles of bleeding are complex and poorly understood and few studies have been conducted on the management of bleeding with the implant,"" the Association of Reproductive Health Professionals <a href=""https://www.arhp.org/publications-and-resources/clinical-proceedings/Single-Rod/History"" target=""_blank"">writes</a>.</p> \n<p>Of the women who discontinue implant use, the most common reason is irregular bleeding. This isn't to say, however, that all women with irregular bleeding decide to have their implant taken out. Instead, it's actually a relatively small minority.</p> \n<p>""About one in ten women who have irregular bleeding want the device removed,"" Rabin says. ""It's a trade-off that most women think is worth it for the contraceptive's efficacy.""</p> \n<h3>5) Complexity, newness of the product, and training are obstacles of the implant</h3> \n<p>I ended my interview with Rabin circling back to my initial question: if the implant works so well, why do so few women use it? She homed in on three main obstacles:</p> \n<ul> \n<li> <b>The implant is relatively new.</b> Implanon came onto the market in the United States in 1998, followed by Nexplanon in 2011. Birth control pills and even IUDs have been around significantly longer (the non-hormonal IUD Paragard, for example, <a href=""http://www.uhs.berkeley.edu/home/healthtopics/PDF%20Handouts/ParaGard%20IUD.pdf"">came onto the market in 1988</a>.) ""It can be a matter of habit to rely on the device that you know,"" Rabin says. ""But I think maybe a decade or so from now, you'll see more of an equalization between IUDs and implants.""</li> \n<li> <b>The implant goes in the arm.</b> Most of gynecologists' work happens, unsurprisingly, in women's reproductive organs. And while learning how to insert the implant is pretty easy (and taught in gynecology residencies) it does require doctors to work on a different part of the body than their day-to-day work typically requires. </li> \n<li> <b>Inserting an implant takes time.</b> Sending a patient off with a prescription for birth control pills is the easier option for health care providers. They don't have to do anything else. But an implant (and an IUD) typically mean a follow-up appointment and a bigger time commitment to insert the device. Separate research has shown that women's health providers are sometimes hesitant to take the extra time that more effective contraceptives require. ""It takes more time than the pill, its a procedure but it does give you better contraceptive coverage,"" Rabin says. </li> \n</ul>"

The dilemma in Republican governance: why fix a program you want to end?,http://www.vox.com/2015/3/27/8299131/medicare-doc-fix-republicans,Why conservatives are angry at John Boehner.,"<p>On Thursday, the House did something truly surprising: it <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/3/17/8232071/medicare-doc-fix-sgr"">passed legislation</a> fixing the way Medicare pays doctors. Or, if fixing is too strong a term, at least making Medicare's payments to doctors predictable. (For much more on the crazy way Medicare manages payments, see Sarah Kliff's <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/3/17/8232071/medicare-doc-fix-sgr"">explainer</a>.)</p> \n<p>At the National Review, Yuval Levin has a thoughtful <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/3/17/8232071/medicare-doc-fix-sgr"">assessment of the House legislation</a>, and why he opposes it. It's worth quoting at length, in part because it illuminates an important tension right now in Republican health-care policy thinking. The GOP's campaign to eliminate or overhaul Obamacare, Medicaid, and Medicare are in tension with any effort to effectively govern the programs. This didn't much matter when Republicans were in the minority, but now that they control Congress, it's becoming a bigger issue.</p> \n<p>Here's Levin:</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>For the next five years, physician payment rates in fee-for-service Medicare would increase by 0.5 percent per year. After that, physician payments in Medicare are supposed to be determined by a new payment system that’s meant to move away from paying for volume toward paying for quality and outcomes. This is basically a replacement of a blunt technocratic instrument with a fine technocratic instrument—and fine technocratic instruments are very often even worse, indeed much worse, than blunt ones.</p> \n<p>The portion of the bill laying out how this is supposed to work adds up to a 120-page demonstration of why the government should not be acting as a health insurer. It draws precisely the wrong lesson from the SGR experience, concluding in essence that, because the Medicare bureaucracy could not manage a crude price-control mechanism without rewarding volume over quality in counterproductive ways, that same bureaucracy should now be assigned to define quality, measure it, and reward it.</p> \n<p>The bill text brims with confidence in the capacity of central planning and public-interested management (""In order to involve the physician, practitioner, and other stakeholder communities in enhancing the infrastructure for resource use measurement, including for purposes of the Merit-based Incentive Payment System under subsection 1833(z), the Secretary shall…), in the clarifying power of federal information management (""In order to classify similar patients into care episode groups and patient condition groups, the Secretary shall…"") and in the potential of the bureaucracy to stand above American health economics and render objective assessments of the relative performance of its parts (""Not later than January 1, 2017, the Comptroller General of the United States shall submit to Congress a report examining whether entities that pool financial risk for physician practices, such as independent risk managers, can play a role in supporting physician practices, particularly small physician practices, in assuming financial risk for the treatment of patients."")</p> \n<p>The core insight underlying the conservative approach to Medicare reform in recent years points in precisely the opposite direction from this proposed payment system. It suggests that the way to contend with the unavoidable complexity of health economics in a free society is not to internalize that complexity in a bureaucracy that seeks to manage the whole but to externalize it in individual consumer decisions that never seek to manage more than small, individual parts.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>There's wisdom in Levin's post. Blunt, simple approaches often are superior to finely tuned technocratic plans. There are real difficulties with the government's efforts to measure the quality of health-care services — a much more subjective concept than the quantity of health-care services.</p> \n<p>But the idea that the private market manages to effectively price American health care is ... bizarre. Medicare has its problems, but this is <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/8/15/6005953/a-10169-blood-test-is-everything-wrong-with-american-health-care"">the current state</a> of pricing in the market that Levin wants to replace it with:</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>Hsia and her colleagues compiled reams of data about how much more than 100 hospitals charged for basic blood work. The prices these facilities charged consumers were all over the map.</p> \n<p>The charge for a lipid panel ranged from $10 to $10,169. Hospital prices for a basic metabolic panel (which doctors use to measure the body's metabolism) were $35 at one facility — and $7,303 at another ... Hsia's previous research looked at the cost of an appendectomy in California and found similarly gigantic variation. For an appendectomy with no complications, she<a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/post/how-much-does-an-appendectomy-cost-somewhere-between-1529-and-186955/2012/04/24/gIQAMeKMeT_blog.html""> found</a> that hospitals in the state would charge anywhere between $1,529 and $186,955.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Americans pay vastly higher prices than residents of any other country, they know almost nothing about the prices they pay, and the cost of particular treatments vary wildly for no discernible reason depending on who's paying and where the service is being delivered. American health-care pricing is an insane mess — and Medicare, for the most part, pays much less than private insurers for the same services. I'm open to certain forms of premium support, but I think pricing is a particularly terrible argument to turn more of health care over to private insurers. (Here are<a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/health-prices/america-is-getting-gouged-on-health-care-prices""> 15 charts</a> showing how nuts American health-care prices are as compared to those in other nations.)</p> \n<p>What's important to understand about Levin's post is that it really isn't an argument for fixing Medicare pricing. It's an argument for <em>not</em> fixing Medicare pricing — because the more problems Medicare has, the more politically vulnerable it will become.</p> \n<p>Levin is a supporter of moving Medicare to a voucherized, premium support system, and a big part of his beef with the House doc fix is it doesn't do that. Indeed, by making Medicare work a little more smoothly, it does the opposite of that. As he writes, ""The most relevant question is about whether the bill as a whole makes a larger reform toward a premium-support system more or less likely."" In this case, he concludes, ""Indulging liberals in this technocratic fantasy is not a step toward the Medicare reforms we need.""</p> \n<p>There is a deep tension in conservatism right now between those who want to use Republican control of Congress to heighten the contradictions in America's social programs, hoping the resulting mess will create opportunities for conservative reform, and those who want to try to improve those programs.</p> \n<p>You can see it particularly clearly in Obamacare, where Republicans are working toward strategies, like the <em>King v. Burwell</em> case, that would sabotage the law in the hopes that the resulting policy mess clears the way for some version of repeal-and-replace (though the ""replace"" part remains vague, to say the least).</p> \n<p>But this approach is present, in gentler form, in Levin's article, too. Republicans want to devolve Medicare to private insurers. That's a tremendous political lift, and the fewer problems there are in Medicare, the harder that lift becomes. One reason conservatives are frustrated with Boehner right now is that in his effort to make Medicare work a bit better in the short term he's potentially making it harder for Republicans to change Medicare completely in the long term.</p>"

It works out to a 12 percent reduction in Medicare spending in the time period studied (from an expected $2.87 trillion down to an actual $2.55 trillion).</p> \n<p>Those savings are meaningful: when the government spends less money on Medicare, it frees up dollars to spend more money on education or defense or whatever other priorities the administration wants to invest in. Over four years, $315 billion could, for example, cover federal spending for the Children's Health Insurance Program (which covers about 8 million low- and middle-income kids) about <a style=""font-size: 1.15em; line-height: 1.65; background-color: #ffffff;"">nine times over</a><span>. Or it could </span><a style=""font-size: 1.15em; line-height: 1.65; background-color: #ffffff;"">cover the entire Education Department's budget</a><span>, without spending any more money.</span></p> \n<p>This is what makes the spending slowdown in health care so meaningful for the federal government: it suggests that Medicare, a program typically seen as a budget-buster, may not be the juggernaut we thought.</p>"

That's huge.,"<p>Between writing best-selling books, operating on cancer patients, and helping fight the Ebola crisis, Harvard surgeon Atul Gawande appears to have pulled off another victory in the past year: <a href=""http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/11/overkill-atul-gawande"">showing that it is, in fact, possible to dramatically reduce health-care costs</a>.</p> \n<p>A few years ago, Gawande<a href=""http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2009/06/01/the-cost-conundrum""> wrote a lengthy piece in the New Yorker about McAllen, Texas</a>: a city that spent way more than the rest of the country on health care but didn't deliver better results (sometimes, the results were worse). ""The difference was that McAllen’s doctors were ordering more of almost everything — diagnostic testing, hospital admissions, procedures,"" Gawande wrote.</p> \n<p><!--  ########  BEGIN SNIPPET  ########  --></p> \n<div class=""chorus-snippet s-related"">\n<span class=""s-related__title"">Related</span> <!-- Add links here --><a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/7/24/5931025/the-10-best-new-yorker-articles-on-health-care"">The 10 best New Yorker articles on health care </a>\n</div> \n<p>His article ran in the summer of 2009, when Congress was in the throes of the health reform debate. And McAllen became a stand-in for everything wrong with American health care: doctors ordering more tests just for the heck of it, but not actually helping anyone get healthier. President Obama brought up the article in <a href=""http://www.themonitor.com/news/local/obama-looking-at-mcallen-healthcare-costs/article_e6a771dc-62f5-5454-8080-3e66d599664f.html"">private meetings</a> and <a href=""http://www.cbsnews.com/news/texas-town-at-center-of-healthcare-debate/"">public speeches</a>.

And nobody seems to have gotten any sicker; they just got rid of the care that wasn't doing any good.</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>As it turns out, the cost of a Medicare patient has flattened across the country, El Paso included. U.S. health-care inflation is the lowest it has been in more than fifty years. Most startling of all, McAllen has been changing its ways. Between 2009 and 2012, its costs dropped almost three thousand dollars per Medicare recipient. Skinner projects the total savings to taxpayers to have reached almost half a <em>billion</em> dollars by the end of 2014. The hope of reform had been to simply ""bend the curve."" This was savings on an unprecedented scale.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>This is partly a story about McAllen, and what happens to a city that becomes synonymous with bad health care. Doctors there, as Gawande writes, began to reevaluate the type of care they provided.</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>The major overuse of home-health-care services proved particularly embarrassing. ""We didn’t know that home health was a thousand dollars a month"" for each patient, Peña said. People in the medical community had never paid attention to how much of it they were ordering or how little of it was really needed. He led monthly staff meetings with more than four hundred local physicians and began encouraging them to be more mindful about signing home-health-care orders. Within a year, home-health-care agencies started going out of business.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>But this is also, in a way, a national story: as Gawande notes, Medicare spending has grown particularly slowly over the past five years. Some of that likely reflects an overall economic slowdown with the recession, but there are lots of health-care economists who think this change is partially structural — that doctors are doing <em>something </em>differently that has helped lower health-care costs.</p> \n<p>You see that particularly in one Obamacare program that has saved<a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/5/4/8545993/obamacare-costs-aco-savings""> $384 million over two years by changing the way it pays doctors</a> — rewarding them for helping patients get better, not for how many tests and scans they provide.</p> \n<p>That Obamacare experiment and McAllen are two glimmers of hope in the health-care system. They suggest that with the proper leadership and tenacity, it really is possible to improve the health-care system in the way Gawande's original article and Obamacare hoped — to lower costs by driving out unnecessary care. It's happening right now.</p>"
Republicans back new effort to get more military women birth control,http://www.vox.com/2015/5/20/8629659/birth-control-military-republicans,Lots of servicewomen have unintended pregnancies â€” and obstacles to accessing contraceptives could be to blame.,"<p>Congress typically spends a lot of time fighting about <a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/obamacare-and-contraceptives"">birth control</a>. This makes it all the more surprising that both Republicans and Democrats are supporting legislation to increase access to contraceptives among women in the military. Robert Pear at the New York Times <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/20/us/lawmakers-back-broader-access-to-contraceptives-for-women-in-the-military.html"">has the details</a>:</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>The annual defense policy bill, passed on Friday by the House, says military clinics and hospitals must be able to dispense any method of <a href=""http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/specialtopic/birth-control-and-family-planning/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier"">contraception</a> approved by the Food and Drug Administration. Women have complained that they are sometimes unable to obtain contraceptives prescribed by their doctors, especially when they are deployed overseas.</p> \n<p>The House bill also says women should, whenever possible, have access to ""a sufficient supply"" that will last for their entire deployment. Women who are overseas for long periods sometimes report that they have difficulty refilling prescriptions because military clinics run out of specific contraceptives and resupply shipments can be slow to arrive.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>The House has passed a bill containing this language, while a similar version is still making its way through the Senate.</p> \n<p>Servicewomen tend to have a higher rate of unintended pregnancy than the civilian population. <a href=""http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/01/24/us-pregnancies-servicewoman-idUSBRE90N1B820130124"">One 2012 report</a><a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22200252""> </a>found that more than 10 percent of women in the military said they'd had an unintended pregnancy in the past year. The Center for American Progress published<a href=""https://cdn.americanprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Arons_OutOfRange-report1.pdf""> a separate report</a> in 2014 detailing the obstacles that military women face in accessing birth control.</p> \n<p>""A survey of servicewomen’s experiences accessing contraception during deployment found that one-third of servicewomen could not obtain the method of birth control they wanted before deployment for a variety of reasons, including short notice of their deployment,"" it found. ""Fifty-nine percent of respondents reported that they did not speak to a provider about contraceptive options prior to deployment, and 41 percent found that their prescriptions were difficult to refill once they were deployed.""</p> \n<p>The congressional proposal would go beyond requiring military hospitals to offer birth control — it would also provide access to long-acting, reversible contraceptives like<a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/11/24/7272485/iud-birth-control-facts""> intra-uterine devices</a> and <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/12/4/7327607/birth-control-implant-facts"">birth control implants</a>. These types of birth control, which are inserted by a doctor and last for years, are better at preventing pregnancy because they leave no space for human error.

The STD test, for example, can't test for HIV, syphilis, or HPV, which all require blood work. And the most effective reversible birth controls are IUDs and the implant, both of which must be inserted by a health professional.</p> \n<p>""Undoubtedly, there are trade-offs,"" Williams says, ""But we think that, on the balance, this is going to positively effect women's health.""</p> \n<p>Still, Williams and Planned Parenthood see the trade-off as worthwhile: that convenience and privacy will ultimately be a big benefit to people who wouldn't make it into the clinic otherwise.</p> \n<p>""Online care shouldn't replace a relationship with a provider,"" Balderson says. ""It's one avenue to increase convenience, but we're also looking to make sure we refer to health-care centers when we need to, as well.""</p>"

That's because patients who don't want vaccines might flock to doctors they know will waive them.</p> \n<p>Now, you could say this is the case for medical exemptions for everything, not just vaccines — that a doctor can sign off on whatever he or she deems being medically necessary for a patient (and collect fees for seeing the patient).</p> \n<p>But there is a policy solution to this particular problem, and it's been enacted in West Virginia, one of the only other states (along with Mississippi) with a strict vaccine mandate. As Orac writes:</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>In contrast, <a href=""http://www.dhhr.wv.gov/oeps/immunization/requirements/Pages/Medical-Exemption-Resource-Center.aspx"">in West Virginia</a>, it isn’t just the word of the child’s physician that matters; all requests for medical exemptions are reviewed by an Immunization Officer, who determines if they are appropriate ""based upon the most recent guidance from the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), and the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) with respect to medical contraindications or precautions for each vaccine.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>So West Virginia asks not only for a signed medical exemption from a doctor, but also for a government immunization officer to approve that request and make sure that it's real.</p> \n<p><!--  ########  BEGIN VOLUME VIDEO  ########  --></p> \n<div data-volume-id=""1028"" data-analytics-placement=""entry:middle"" data-volume-placement=""article"" id=""volume-placement-5886"" class=""volume-video"" data-volume-uuid=""bd763cd4b"" data-analytics-label=""The 220-year history of the anti-vaccine movement | 1028"" data-analytics-action=""volume:view:entry:middle"" data-analytics-viewport=""video""></div> \n<!--  ########  END VOLUME VIDEO  ########  --> \n<h3>California's the perfect test of whether a vaccine mandate actually changes vaccination rates</h3> \n<p>An interesting post at <a href=""http://www.wired.com/2015/06/sb277-california-is-now-the-perfect-test-lab-for-vaccine-laws/"">Wired</a> by journalist Katie Palmer points out that <span>California</span> is the perfect testing lab to study the consequences of vaccine mandates.

Mississippi has the highest rate in the country, but West Virginia is number 18. If the mandate was the panacea, she notes, both states should theoretically be at the top. <br><br>On the other hand, she writes, there appears to be a link between states that allow both religious and philosophical exemptions to vaccines and lower vaccine rates, but that the pattern doesn't necessarily mean that the policy actually changed the rate. (There could be other factors that explain some of the trends: for example, states that already have a stronger anti-vaccine sentiment may be more likely to have more lax policies.)</p> \n<p>So we need better evidence, and California presents a unique opportunity. West Virginia and Mississippi enacted their policies decades ago, making it difficult to figure out how their policies are having an impact on current vaccination. She writes:</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>Now is the time to test that hypothesis. California is at a historical inflection point. If public health researchers and politicians can look carefully at the state of the state’s vaccination rates and disease numbers before and after SB277 is enacted, they’ll get a powerful tool to either support more bans of these exemptions—several of which are on the table in other states right now—or drive the United States toward different, perhaps more effective strategies to reduce vaccine-preventable disease. Let’s see what comes out of the lab.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Measuring these and other outcomes is a very smart idea that could save lives.</p>"
A new study reveals something important about obesity and health costs,http://www.vox.com/2015/7/17/8990625/obesity-health-costs,"""So far as health-care spending goes, not all obesity is equal, or even close to it.""","<p>A <a href=""http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs40273-014-0230-2"">new paper</a> in the journal <i>PharmacoEconomics</i> estimates that obesity is costing the US $315 billion in health-care costs alone. But those costs aren't distributed the way people normally think.</p> \n<p>As physician Aaron Carroll <a href=""http://theincidentaleconomist.com/wordpress/what-are-the-costs-of-obesity/"">writes</a>, the way we talk about obesity suggests that ""if everyone in the US would just lose a little weight, we’d save massive money."" This paper shows that's not true. Rather, ""the relationship of medical care costs over BMI [body mass index] is J-shaped"" — which is to say, the costs are concentrated in the small percentage of the population that's most obese.</p> \n<p>To put this in dollar terms, someone with a BMI of 30 who loses 5 percent of her bodyweight will save $69 in health-care costs each year. Someone with a BMI of 35 who loses 5 percent of his bodyweight will save $528. Someone with a BMI of 40 who loses 5 percent of her bodyweight will save <i>$2,137</i>.</p> \n<p>Technically, all these people are obese. But so far as health-care spending goes, not all obesity is equal, or even close to it.</p> \n<p>""If our goal is to reduce the cost to the US for obesity, we should likely focus on that small group of people, who are also likely the hardest to reach and influence,"" writes Carroll. ""Trying to get lots of people who have a BMI of 30-35 to lose some weight might make them feel better, but won't influence health care spending in the US much at all.""</p> \n<p>This is a principle that recurs often in health care: A massive amount of the costs are concentrated in a very small fraction of the population.

Here's what it looked like for a hospital near my house, at Howard University:</p> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""3943352"">\n<img src=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3943352/howard%20yelp.png""> \n<div class=""caption""> \n<p>(<a href=""http://www.yelp.com/biz/howard-university-hospital-washington-4"">Yelp</a>)</p> \n</div> \n</div> \n<p>Nursing home pages have information about fines the facility has paid in recent years as well as serious deficiencies noted by inspectors:</p> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""3943360"">\n<img src=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3943360/nursing.png""> \n<div class=""caption""> \n<p>(<a href=""http://www.yelp.com/biz/beachside-nursing-center-huntington-beach-2"">Yelp</a>)</p> \n</div> \n</div> \n<p>The data behind the new Yelp listings comes from two places: Medicare and ProPublica, a nonprofit that supports investigative journalism. Both maintain great databases of patient safety information (Medicare's <a href=""https://www.medicare.gov/hospitalcompare/search.html"">Hospital Compare</a> and ProPublica's <a href=""http://projects.propublica.org/nursing-homes/"">Nursing Home Inspect</a>), but both can also be difficult for consumers to navigate. The idea here is to make existing information more accessible.</p> \n<p>""We're taking data that otherwise might live in some government pdf that's hard to find and we're putting it in a context where it makes sense for people who may be in the middle of making critical decisions,"" Yelp's Luther Lowe <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2015/08/05/coming-to-yelp-a-bigger-dose-of-data-on-health-care-facilities/"">told</a> Lena Sun at the Washington Post.</p> \n<p>Will the new Yelp tool change how Americans shop for health care? I'd wager yes. Right now it's really difficult to compare different facilities. The Hospital Compare database has a wealth of information — we used it to make <a href=""http://www.vox.com/a/infections-hospitals-map"" target=""_blank"">this map</a> of hospital infection rates — but it's hard for consumers to navigate. There's a deluge of information with dozens of different metrics; reading just one hospital's profile is a bit like drinking from a fire hose.</p> \n<p>The data Yelp has decided to include is far from a complete picture. Still, it's probably better information than the word-of-mouth recommendations we often use to pick a hospital — and in a format that's easier to access than before.</p>"

How we die in the US versus how people die abroad,http://www.vox.com/2015/8/20/9183195/death-us-abroad,Whatâ€™s the average life expectancy in the world's 31 poorest countries? 59 years.,"<p>In the past few years, there's been a lot of talk about how we die in America. There's been a lot less talk about how we don't.</p> \n<p>We don't die from diarrhea. We don’t die from malnutrition. We don't die from tuberculosis.</p> \n<p>The rest of the world isn’t so lucky. I was looking at World Health Organization <a href=""http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs310/en/index1.html"">statistics</a> last week and was struck by the huge gap between the richest and poorest nations. In countries like Afghanistan and Ethiopia, communicable and <em>conquerable </em>illnesses like TB kill people at hundreds of times the rate of death as in the United States.</p> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""3985512""><img src=""https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3985512/Screen%20Shot%202015-08-20%20at%201.20.20%20PM.png""></div> \n<p>Organizations like the Gates Foundation are <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/dandiamond/2015/01/22/bill-gates-says-we-can-save-millions-of-children-from-dying-heres-how/"">working</a> to disseminate simple, replicable interventions like encouraging mothers to dry their newborns and breastfeed them. But the problems are still huge, and the public health challenge remains enormous.</p> \n<p>""There are still 6 million children who die every year before their fifth birthday from causes that are almost entirely preventable,"" William Heisel told me. Heisel is the director of global engagement for the <a href=""http://www.healthdata.org/"">Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation</a>. (He was emailing with me from Rwanda, one of the world's poorest and sickest nations.) ""We know what strategies work, and yet those strategies are not available equally around the world,"" he added.</p> \n<p>As epidemiologists and analysts know well, a nation's disease patterns vary dramatically based on underlying public health, as do the risk factors for mortality. For an especially stark comparison, I'll hold the United States up to one of the world's largest low-income countries, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and contrast four important factors.</p> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""3985560""><img src=""https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3985560/Screen%20Shot%202015-08-20%20at%201.31.16%20PM.png""></div> \n<p>Of course, high-income nations have plenty of <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/9/2/6089693/health-care-facts-whats-wrong-american-insurance"">serious</a> health-care challenges, too. But many of our afflictions are first-world afflictions.</p> \n<p>Alzheimer's is horrible, and we desperately need a cure — but it almost always strikes the elderly, after they've lived a reasonably full life. (More than 96 percent of the 5 million-plus Americans with Alzheimer's are <a href=""http://www.alz.org/facts/downloads/facts_figures_2015.pdf"">over</a> age 65.) Heart disease, stroke, and other top causes of death in the United States also tend to afflict Americans later in life.</p> \n<p>In comparison, many residents of low-income nations don't live long enough to die from these chronic diseases. The average life expectancy in the world's 31 poorest countries is just 59 years.</p> \n<p>And while Americans might realize just how good we have it — broken health system and all — I'd bet most of us don't grasp just how fixable the world's public health problems could be.</p> \n<p>""On average, it costs just $4,000 to save a child under 5 from dying, and it costs even less in the poorest countries,"" Heisel told me.</p> \n<p>""If you look at the scale-up in health assistance that began in the 1990s, which funded things like medicine for HIV patients, bednets to prevent malaria, and vaccine programs, and you look at the declines in death and suffering around the same countries that received that funding, it's hard not to see the linkage.""</p> \n<!--  ########  BEGIN VOLUME VIDEO  ########  --> \n<div data-volume-id=""3725"" data-analytics-placement=""entry:middle"" data-volume-placement=""article"" id=""volume-placement-3909"" class=""volume-video"" data-volume-uuid=""d97d40dbd"" data-analytics-label=""The #1 reason people die early, in each country | 3725"" data-analytics-action=""volume:view:entry:middle"" data-analytics-viewport=""video""></div> \n<!--  ########  END VOLUME VIDEO  ########  -->"
A government shutdown fight is brewing. This one is over Planned Parenthood.,http://www.vox.com/2015/9/10/9297303/planned-parenthood-government-shutdown,This fight is shaping up into the biggest policy clash of the rest of the year.,"<p>Arizona Rep. Trent Franks, one of the most conservative Republicans in the House, opened a hearing on Planned Parenthood Wednesday with a statement that should terrify House Speaker John Boehner.</p> \n<p>""The sands of time should blow over the Capitol dome before we ever give Planned Parenthood one more dime of taxpayers' money,"" Franks declared in an opening statement.</p> \n<p>Franks is part of a movement in the Republican Congress hell-bent on defunding Planned Parenthood, potentially even shutting down the government. This fight is shaping up into the biggest policy clash of the rest of the year — testing the power of the far-right wing of the Republican conference and, once again, putting Planned Parenthood in the spotlight.</p> \n<p>House Speaker John Boehner knows defunding Planned Parenthood won't fly with Democrats in the Senate or with President Barack Obama. The question is whether Boehner can keep enough of his conference in line to pass a bill to keep the government running, as he did a year ago, or whether he'll lose them and endure a government shutdown, as he did two years ago when the government closed for almost a month.</p> \n<p>So far, at least, the issue is not going away. It came up repeatedly at Wednesday's hearing — despite the fact that the hearing was meant to focus on ""the organization's practices.""</p> \n<p>""When Congress sets budget priorities, we have to decide what's important and what should not be funded,"" Michigan Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner said, questioning Planned Parenthood's funding. ""Would you please tell us why Planned Parenthood needs to get over a half-billion in federal funding each year when there are other pressing needs like feeding hungry children?""</p> \n<p>And speaking on Planned Parenthood's funding, Idaho Rep. Raul Labrador added, ""This nation should step back on whether we are a moral nation or an immoral nation.""</p> \n<h3>Planned Parenthood gets just over $500 million in public funds annually</h3> \n<p>Just over 40 percent of Planned Parenthood's budget comes from government grants and reimbursements, the organization's most recent <a href=""http://issuu.com/actionfund/docs/annual_report_final_proof_12.16.14_/0"">budget report</a> shows. Between June 2013 and 2014, Planned Parenthood received $528.4 million in public funding, a big chunk of its $1.3 billion national budget.</p> \n<p>That $528.4 million figure covers both state and federal funding, and Planned Parenthood does not publicly break out how much money it gets just from federal funding. The best estimate arguably comes from the Government Accountability Office, which <a href=""http://www.gao.gov/assets/670/669140.pdf"">estimated</a> that Planned Parenthood received $105 million in federal funding in 2012.</p> \n<p>There are two main ways Planned Parenthood receives public funds. One is through Medicaid, the public health insurance program that covers 71 million low-income Americans. Whenever a Medicaid patient has an appointment at a Planned Parenthood clinic, the nonprofit will bill the health plan for whatever services the patient uses.</p> \n<p>The other source of funding is grants, largely through the Title X Family Planning Program — the only domestic grant program dedicated to family planning. Organizations like Planned Parenthood often use Title X grants to subsidize birth control, STD screenings, and other reproductive health services for low-income patients who may lack health insurance coverage.</p> \n<p>Planned Parenthood receives Title X funds both directly from the federal government and from states, which will sometimes make the nonprofit's health center a subgrantee for the dollars they receive from the federal government.</p> \n<h3>Planned Parenthood doesn't use federal dollars to pay for abortions — but conservatives argue funds are ""fungible""</h3> \n<p>The current government shutdown fight has a sense of déjà vu for Capitol Hill veterans: Conservatives unsuccessfully attempted to defund Planned Parenthood in a 2011 budget fight.</p> \n<p>A government shutdown was only averted when Congress reached a budget deal at the last moment — only one hour before funds would have run out. That deal continued the funding Planned Parenthood had then, and that continues today.</p> \n<p>Planned Parenthood remains a key target for conservatives because it is the largest abortion provider in the country. Federal law expressly prohibits the use of federal funds to pay for abortions. While abortion providers like Planned Parenthood can qualify for grants, the government requires that no federal dollars go toward the termination of pregnancies.</p> \n<p>There is no evidence currently suggesting that Planned Parenthood illegally uses federal funds to pay for abortions. Still, conservatives have protested that it's possible — and that the best solution is to strip Planned Parenthood of all federal dollars altogether.</p> \n<p>""Money is fungible,"" Sensenbrenner said at the hearing. ""You and I know that.""</p> \n<h3>Can a Planned Parenthood fight shut down the government?</h3> \n<p>We know there's a faction of conservative Republicans who want to cut off Planned Parenthood's funding. At least <a href=""http://heritageaction.com/defund-planned-parenthood/?utm_source=heritageaction&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=gr-hill&amp;utm_content="">31 members</a> have signed on to a Heritage Action pledge refusing to back a budget that funds the group.</p> \n<p>We also know the Obama administration will not bend on the issue and, historically, has gone to great lengths to defend Planned Parenthood's funding.</p> \n<p>What we don't know, at this point, is how those two forces ultimately collide. Republican leaders are, according to Politico, already looking at a short-term budget bill that could keep the government running for an additional month as the debate continues.</p> \n<p>And it's hard to know how far conservatives are willing to take their fight — whether the 31 members committed to defunding the group will see their ranks grow.</p> \n<p>And even for Franks, who started the hearing with a fiery statement, it's not clear how far he's willing to go on the issue. At the end of the five-hour hearing, I asked him whether he'd be okay with a government shutdown over Planned Parenthood's funding. He told me, ""I'm not going to answer that,"" before walking out of the room.</p>"
Ben Carson is a great doctor. But that wouldn't make him a good president.,http://www.vox.com/2015/9/15/9330675/ben-carson-republican-presidental-candidate-doctor,There's no evidence the surgeon has the negotiation and leadership skills to succeed in politics.,"<p>Can a doctor be president? Ben Carson's trying to be our first.</p> \n<p>Polls have him tied with Donald Trump atop the Republican field. Carson's single best pitch for the job? That as a surgeon, he's uniquely qualified to make hard decisions.</p> \n<p><!--  ########  BEGIN SNIPPET  ########  --></p> \n<div class=""chorus-snippet s-related"" data-analytics-action=""link:related"" data-analytics-category=""article"">\n<span class=""s-related__title"">Related</span> <!-- Add links here --><a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/6/18/8806817/presidential-debate-schedule"">Presidential debate schedule, 2015-2016</a><br><!-- End links -->\n</div> \n<!--  ########  END SNIPPET  ########  --> \n<p>""This is a big theme of Carson's presidential pitch: that neither the rigors of the campaign nor those of the White House can faze a man who held children's lives in his hands,"" Jim Rutenberg <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/22/magazine/how-do-you-solve-a-problem-like-ben-carson.html?_r=0"" style=""font-size: 1.3em; line-height: 1.65; background-color: #ffffff;"">wrote</a><span> in the New York Times, back in March. </span><span>""His life in brain surgery has prepared him for the presidency, [Carson] maintains, better than lives in politics have for his rivals.""</span></p> \n<p>Of course, those rivals don't agree. ""Ben's a doctor, and he's not a dealmaker,"" Trump said on<i> Face the Nation</i> this week.</p> \n<p>Experts in surgery, leadership, and presidential history disagree with Carson, too.</p> \n<p>""Nothing in the life of a surgeon prepares you for the complicated negotiating structure of the presidency,"" Elaine Kamarck of the Brookings Institution told me.</p> \n<h3>How to think about surgeons</h3> \n<p>There's no question that of all the major candidates, Carson has the most proficiency in a <em>technical</em> skill. He spent four years in medical school, and another six years in residency.</p> \n<p>And to become a Johns Hopkins neurosurgeon isn't just a matter of tenure and persistence; you need true talents. <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Gifted-Hands-Ben-Carson-Story/dp/0310214696"">""Gifted hands,""</a> say.</p> \n<p>Regardless of what happens with Carson's presidential run, his life has already defied the odds. And his career has been important and meaningful: He's helped advance medicine, and saved thousands of lives.</p> \n<p>But while surgeons play God in the operating room, they're just as human as the rest of us. Many have problems <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/30/your-money/money-advice-for-doctors-and-lawyers.html?_r=0"">managing their money</a> or their tempers.</p> \n<p>The writer Malcolm Gladwell even says we overestimate the difficulty of surgery, and claims that with enough practice — and fine motor skills — nearly anyone who can drive a car can also be a heart surgeon.</p> \n<p>""I have a very low opinion of the difficulty of cardiac surgery,"" Gladwell <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/dandiamond/2015/02/27/malcolm-gladwells-law-if-you-can-drive-a-car-you-can-do-heart-surgery/"">confessed</a> in an interview last year.</p> \n<h3>Why surgeons tend to be lackluster leaders</h3> \n<p>I think Gladwell goes too far. The best surgeons are incredibly driven and exceptionally smart, and it's no surprise that some have found success outside of the hospital. Heart surgeon Bill Frist became Senate majority leader. General surgeon Atul Gawande is arguably America's best health-care journalist.</p> \n<p>But Gladwell is right that sheer <a href=""http://www.harrisinteractive.com/NewsRoom/HarrisPolls/tabid/447/mid/1508/articleId/1490/ctl/ReadCustom%20Default/Default.aspx"">admiration</a> for surgeons may blind us to the reality of the job. And Justin Dimick, a University of Michigan surgeon who runs a leadership development program, agrees that it's a mistake to ascribe certain skills to <em>all</em> surgeons. That's especially true for a rare quality like leadership.</p> \n<p>""Does being a surgeon make you a better leader?"" Dimick mused in an interview. ""I haven't seen any evidence to suggest that.""</p> \n<p>Dimick co-authored a recent <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26323368?dopt=Citation"">study</a> that found rising surgeon-leaders admitted to having gaps in key administrative skills, like setting a vision and getting others to follow them. This isn't surprising: Doctors go to school to be doctors. They don't go to school to learn management skills.</p> \n<p>""Most physicians have major deficits in those leadership competencies by the time they're elevated to leadership positions,"" Dimick says. ""And that's why we developed our leadership program — to help them develop those competencies in an intentional way.""</p> \n<p>And while Carson has held that surgery is the best preparation for national leadership, I couldn't find an expert who agrees with him. Instead, a half-dozen researchers kept returning to the same theme: It's very different to be a leader in the operating room, where a surgeon has total autonomy, than it is to be a leader in politics, business, or beyond.</p> \n<p>""<span>Some surgeons lead well within the OR, but once they leave that sphere of influence … they can often be horrible at leading others (and leading themselves, too)</span>,"" University of Alabama Birmingham scholar Christy Lemak said via email.</p> \n<p>""For every surgeon who ends up succeeding in the boardroom,"" Dimick adds, ""there are probably an equal number of surgeons who haven't dealt with the stress well and ended up in anger management.""</p> \n<h3>Why a doctor might not be ready for the presidency</h3> \n<p>Rather than focus on whether a doctor can be president, there's a different way to approach Carson's candidacy: by identifying the qualities of our nation's <em>best</em> presidents.</p> \n<p>Kamarck would know: She's a veteran of the Clinton White House, a Brookings Institution scholar, and the author of the forthcoming book <i>Why Presidents Fail</i>.</p> \n<p>""Great presidents are great politicians,"" Kamarck told me. ""The presidency was designed by the Founding Fathers to not be an autocratic place."" She ticked off a few examples of presidents who were able to navigate difficult politics and build consensus: Franklin Roosevelt, Ronald Reagan, and Bill Clinton.</p> \n<p>Based on that rubric, I asked Kamarck who was best prepared among the Republican field. She named John Kasich — the Ohio governor who also served in Congress and ran the House Budget Committee.</p> \n<p>""He's conducted the most complicated negotiations in the government, with Congress, and over the budget,"" Kamarck said. ""Kasich stands out from the crowd, in terms of the experiences [that] allow you to be a good president.""</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, Carson's most prominent leadership experience outside of the hospital is serving on the boards of Kellogg and Costco. And that's why Kamarck's opinion on Carson was less optimistic.</p> \n<p>""People who are not used to working in a world that requires negotiation will be frustrated"" by the presidency, Kamarck added. ""And brilliant doctors — wonderful as they are [for] opening up a heart  — don't have to have a negotiation for what they do.""</p> \n<p>Kamarck said we should think about choosing our president the way we think about choosing a doctor.</p> \n<p>""If you needed brain surgery, wouldn't you want to go to somebody who <em>knows</em> how to do brain surgery?"" she added. ""You look at someone who knows how to do the actual job.""</p> \n<p>Correction: A previous version of this article reported that Kasich was the former head of the Office of Management and Budget. The piece has been updated.</p> \n"

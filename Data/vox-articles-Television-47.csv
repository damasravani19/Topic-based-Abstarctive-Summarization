The problem with the Comcast-Time Warner Cable merger,http://www.vox.com/2014/8/23/6057357/the-problem-with-the-comcast-time-warner-cable-merger,"Comcast and Time Warner don't compete directly with each other, but the merger could still harm competition in the television and internet industries.","<p>America's largest cable company, Comcast, has signed a deal to buy Time Warner Cable, the second largest. The deal requires approval from the Federal Communications Commission, which is currently soliciting public comments on the transaction. The deadline for comments is on Monday.</p> \n<p>At first blush, it seems like the transaction shouldn't have much effect on consumers. The service areas of traditional cable companies don't overlap, so combining Comcast and Time Warner won't reduce the number of options customers have for cable or internet service.</p> \n<p>But cable companies don't only operate in the consumer market. They also negotiate with network owners and content providers on the ""back end"" of their networks. And here size has a huge — and problematic — impact on the competitiveness of the market.</p> \n<p>A good example of this is Comcast's <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/5/6/5678080/voxsplaining-telecom"">dispute</a> earlier this year with Netflix. Netflix says Comcast strong-armed it into paying unfair tolls to deliver content to Comcast's own customers. Comcast says it was just an ordinary commercial dispute.</p> \n<p>The dispute puts the FCC in an awkward position, because it's hard to draw a clear line between legitimate business practices and monopolistic ones. The FCC probably doesn't want to get bogged down with policing the terms of each of the hundreds of peering agreements made between cable companies and ISPs. Yet Netflix, as well as ISPs such as Level 3 and Cogent, have raised some legitimate concerns about Comcast's business practices; ignoring them entirely isn't a good option either.</p> \n<p><q class=""right"" aria-hidden=""true""><span>The merger will make Comcast even bigger, giving it even more leverage in negotiations with Netflix and others</span></q></p> \n<p>This is a problem created by Comcast's vast size. Small ISPs don't have the leverage to make the kinds of demands Comcast (and Verizon, another massive ISP) have made of companies such as Netflix. In a more decentralized broadband market, the FCC could leave these kinds of peering negotiations to the free market. But as the broadband market gets more concentrated, the danger of broadband companies abusing their power becomes correspondingly larger.</p> \n<p>The merger will make Comcast even bigger, giving it even more leverage in negotiations with Netflix and others. That will increase the need for regulatory oversight to ensure Comcast doesn't abuse its market power.</p> \n<p>And the same point applies to the cable television market. Comcast negotiates with big content companies like Fox and Disney for access to their content. Right now, some of these media conglomerates have a pretty strong bargaining position. That allows market forces to keep cable companies in check.</p> \n<p>Adding Time Warner Cable's heft to Comcast's will produce a cable behemoth whose business practices will require closer watch from regulators. It's hard to predict exactly what kinds of problems might crop up. But allowing one of America's least competitive industries to become even more concentrated is likely to make things worse, not better.</p> \n<p>The FCC is interested in hearing from the public.

True Blood never figured out what it wanted its vampires to be,http://www.vox.com/2014/8/24/6057383/true-blood-series-finale,"True Blood thought it was being simple and lazy when, actually, it was being perfect.","<p><span>""I wanna do bad things with you.""</span></p> \n<p>For the last seven seasons, that line introduced every episode of HBO's wild vampire soap <i>True Blood</i>. It's a confident invitation — a promise of excitement, danger, and sex. Unfortunately, for the last three seasons, it's served as a reminder of how much fun viewers are <i>not </i>having. And it can only serve to disappoint even more heading into tonight's series finale.</p> \n<p>In the beginning, this beguiling show had a premise that felt fresh. Vampires in <i>True Blood</i> were fantastical beings capable of amazing feats, blessed with good looks, and possessing unquenchable sex drives. Yet they were still struggling for equal rights in the eyes of the American people.</p> \n<p>The oppression of vampires was meant to be representative of xenophobia, homophobia, racism, or misogyny. An added layer of this was that vampire blood was valuable. It had healing qualities and induced euphoria, which made vampires an endangered species, hunted for their blood.</p> \n<p>Vampires in television and movies had explored some of these themes before. In Stephenie Meyer's <i>Twilight </i>series, vampires were misunderstood, amazing creatures trying to stay out of the way of the rest of humanity by eternally haunting one high school. <i>Underworld</i> made vampires stand-ins for elites fighting against extinction. <i>Buffy the Vampire</i> <i>Slayer</i> used vampires as stand-ins for predators and the patriarchy (""one girl in all the world … she alone will wield the strength …  to stop the spread of their evil and the swell of their numbers""). And those are only a few of pop culture's recent vampire touchstones. We could go even deeper by dipping into classic vampire tales.</p> \n<p>But this also meant vampires were well-worn territory, which made <i>True Blood</i> developer Alan Ball's fresh interpretation of Charlaine Harris's novels more impressive. Ball was blunt in the show's first season, wrapping stories about civil rights, fetishes, and miscegenation around both his human and vampire characters.</p> \n<p>Bill (Stephen Moyer) and Sookie (Anna Paquin), their strange love story, and the reactions of the humans in Bon Temps, Louisiana, drove that first season. Even though the vampires had ugly sides, the humans, like vampire blood addict Amy Burley (Lizzy Caplan), who captured and tortured a vampire for his blood, and Rene (Michael Raymond-James), a serial killer, were just as capable of ugliness.</p> \n<p>At times, Ball's bluntness felt too formulaic. The series featured only smart heroes and dumb villains, and the other characters were either adorable idiots or thrown into the pile of vampire haters. And it seemed like he knew this too.</p> \n<p>""To look at these vampires on the show as metaphors for gays and lesbians is so simple and so easy, that it's kind of lazy,"" <a href=""http://nypost.com/2009/06/23/flesh-blood/"">Ball said during a 2009 press conference.</a> ""If you get really serious about it, well, then the show could be seen to be very homophobic because vampires are dangerous: They kill, they're amoral.""</p> \n<div style=""text-align:center""><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""center"">the show wanted us to See vampires as stand-ins for the Republican field of 2012.</q></div> \n<div style=""text-align:center""><br></div> \n<p>The season after those comments were made revolved around Russell Edgington (Denis O'Hare), a manipulative, angry, gay vampire king of Mississippi who killed without abandon. An over-the-top, gay, militant villain felt like an equally lazy attempt to stop the ""lazy"" gay rights allegory that everyone saw in the show. But that didn't stop Edgington from becoming a <a style=""line-height: 1.5;"" href=""http://screenrant.com/true-blood-season-5-russell-edgington-aco-122228/"">fan-favorite.</a></p> \n<p>Fairies, werewolves, witches, mediums, shape-shifters, and were-panthers (like werewolves, but panthers) were introduced and fleshed out in the next couple of seasons, culminating in a season-breaking female were-panther gang rape of Jason Stackhouse (Ryan Kwanten). That incident pointed to a larger problem with the show's fantastical elements: these supernatural beings didn't really reflect anything bigger the way vampires once had. Most of the time, fairies/were-panthers/werewolves were just there to introduce the audience to other, meaner fairies/were-panthers/werewolves.</p> \n<p><span>That shallowness is why no one is really grieving that those storylines have been dropped. </span></p> \n<p>But the plot that broke the whole show came in the fifth season, when Ball plunged us into the bowels of The Authority, a secret vampire council that rules vampire society. While it didn't help that the majority of the season was set in the Authority's underground, gray home base, what really bogged down the fifth season was the strange, heavy-handed religious aspect of the show, which featured a cabal of old, powerful vampires who believed in strict adherence to a vampire bible of sorts.</p> \n<p><i>True Blood </i>stopped being fun. Instead of wanting to do bad things with us, the show wanted us to see vampires as stand-ins for the Republican field of 2012. <span>Vampires went from fun, supernatural one-night stands to Rick Santorum. </span></p> \n<p><span></span><span>""For me the jumping off point was watching the Republican primaries, watching Michele Bachmann, Rick Santorum, and asking what would it be like  to have a theocracy in America — which is way more terrifying than any fictional monster could ever be,"" Ball told</span><a style=""line-height: 1.5; background-color: #ffffff;"" href=""http://www.thewrap.com/tv/column-post/true-blood-season-was-inspired-rick-santorum-says-alan-ball-44446/""> The Wrap</a><span> in 2012. </span></p> \n<p><span>It's deeply strange that not even primary voters ultimately found Rick Santorum all that appealing, yet a whole season was built around him. </span><span>The </span><a style=""line-height: 1.5; background-color: #ffffff;"" href=""http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/tag/true-blood-ratings/page/11/"">fifth season's ratings dipped</a><span> from the highs of the third and fourth installments, and Ball left the show after the season's conclusion.</span></p> \n<p>Instead of veering knee-deep into The Authority or trying to introduce new characters, it's still a mystery why the show didn't give more to its strong supporting characters. <span>Lafayette (Nelsan Ellis), Arlene Bellefleur (Carrie Preston), </span><span>Tara Thornton (Rutina Wesley), and Jason Stackhouse all sparkled, but were often too stuck into one-note caricatures — Lafayette always sassy, Arlene always neurotic, Tara always angry, and Jason always randy. </span></p> \n<p><span>Each one of these actors brought</span><span> a humanity to their characters that made them feel like outsiders despite not having fangs, fairy blood, or shape-shifting abilities. And seven seasons later, these characters (the ones who are alive anyway), except for maybe Arlene, are still in the same place doing the same things we saw them doing in the first season. </span></p> \n<p>Mark Hudis (<i>Nurse Jackie</i>) replaced Ball, and then <a href=""http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/hbos-true-blood-showrunner-replaced-427034"">was replaced </a>by Brian Buckner (<i>Friends</i>), who was with <i>True Blood</i> since the first season. Now, vamps have once again become the hunted, doomed for death by Sarah Newlin (Anna Camp) and the AIDS-like disease called Hep-V — a plot spanning the last two seasons. The Yakuza have made an appearance. Hoyt's mom died, prompting Hoyt to come back from Alaska. And there was a penis-shaped, hot metal torture device.</p> \n<p>But despite all these spinning plates, there's been a lack of pace and a cloud of boredom in Bon Temps. There may just be too much scar tissue from seasons past for anyone to get too excited about a show that once promised excess. The show mistook simple for lazy, convoluted for interesting. In trying to tinker with and continually redefine its vampires, the show ended up gumming up its own motor. <span>And along the way, it lost all the excess, and we lost all the fun we were having.</span></p> \n<p><i>True Blood ends its run tonight at 9 p.m Eastern on HBO.</i></p>",Television
"The Leftovers, Episode 9: Why everyone on this show is so miserable, explained",http://www.vox.com/2014/8/25/6064049/the-leftovers-episode-9-why-everyone-on-this-show-is-so-miserable,Here's a rundown of what the characters were doing just before the Vanishings.,"<p><b>The episode in a sentence:</b> The show finally gives us a flashback to the events of the Departure.</p> \n<p>That's right. This <i>is</i> a Damon Lindelof series. Just like <i>Lost (</i>his other ""WTF is happening?!"" television show), <i>The Leftovers</i> sure knows how to tell a story. Lindelof doesn't take audiences from A to B to C, then on until Z; he takes them from A to C to X, then back to B, before jumping to the number nine.</p> \n<p>Here's a look at what the Departure was like for each character on the show.</p> \n<h3><span>Kevin</span></h3> \n<p>The episode opens on Kevin (Justin Theroux) going for a run. The world around him is chipper and friendly, and ""The Girl from King Marie"" plays in his headphones. Per his usual routine, he stops at a mailbox, taking a cigarette from the pack he's taped underneath it. He has to sneak away and smoke — like he did at summer camp in Cairo! — because, surprise, Laurie (Amy Brenneman) doesn't want him to smoke. He makes his way home, and in typical <i>Lost</i>-reveal style, we learn that the Departure hasn't yet happened, but is imminent.</p> \n<p>Kevin's relationship with his children is great: he's interested in them and protective of them, and they return his love. (Seriously, there was so much affection going on between the Garveys!) His relationship with Laurie seems picture-perfect, maybe almost too perfect. Lurking beneath the surface is a man unsatisfied with the whole thing. He feels trapped, like the deer he insists on saving from slaughter. No need to kill the creature — a tranquilizer can do the trick.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""left"">Where were you on october 14?</q></p> \n<p>During a fight at the end of the episode, Laurie makes it obvious that Kevin identifies with the trapped deer. He gets angry and hollers, ""Fuck you, Laurie,"" and then goes and fucks someone else. (Were those the last words he said to his wife before she left him for the GR?)</p> \n<p><span>Kevin seems to have everything an American man is supposed to aspire to: a beautiful spouse, loving children, an exquisite home, and an honorable career. </span>The contrast to his life post-October 14 is painful to watch — like the biblical Job, Kevin really had everything taken away from him in one fell swoop.</p> \n<h3>Garvey, Sr.</h3> \n<p>The last time we saw Kevin's dad (Scott Glenn) was when Kevin locked him up after he went crazy and tried to recruit his son to do The Voices' bidding. In episode nine, however, he's trying to convince his son that there are no voices, even voices of ambition, and Kevin should stop listening to them.</p> \n<p>""Why isn't it enough?"" Kevin asks, referring to his picture-perfect life. Kevin feels like he should be content with all that he has. His father tells him he's not alone in his dissatisfaction: ""Every man rebels against the idea that this is fucking it."" Garvey wants more than the family he has. After October 14, all he wants is the family he had.</p> \n<p>Kevin's dad is much more interesting as a character in the post-Departure world. And his romantic relationship with Mayor Lucy (Amanda Warren) is one I still don't understand. At any rate, father/son relationships are incredibly important to the overall narrative of <i>The Leftovers </i>— next week's episode is titled ""The Prodigal Son Returns"" — and Kevin's father serves an important function. The Garvey man-hug, the tight embrace of three generations of Garvey men, was a tender moment to watch, but also bittersweet because we know dissolution is coming.</p> \n<p><chorus-asset class=""chorus-snippet browser_wide_media"" data-id=""671228""> <img alt=""Kevin and Garvey, Sr. "" class=""small"" src=""http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/671228/772224_TL109s37_061014_PS32586.0.jpg""> </chorus-asset></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Justin Theroux, Scott Glenn. (Paul Schiraldi/HBO)</p> \n<h3>Laurie</h3> \n<p>We learn Laurie is a therapist, and one of her clients is Patti (Ann Dowd), who just died in last week's episode, set in the present. Laurie's office bears a calendar, very similar to the GR's own wall-hangings, that says, ""The foot feels the foot when it feels the ground."" This seems like it may be included because, well, it doesn't really mean anything. It's one of those fancy-sounding sayings that serves more as a distraction from a riddle than an answer to a question.</p> \n<p>Laurie's home is luxurious. Her office is elegant. Everything about her life is in meticulous order. But Patti sees through it. ""There's something wrong inside you,"" she says during one of their sessions. Laurie seems momentarily affected by the would-be prophet's diagnosis, but in the end, she maintains her brave face and tells Patti she's got it wrong. ""There's nothing wrong with me,"" she answers. (Now we know where Jill got her ""I'm OK"" stuff. The self-deluding apple doesn't fall far from the tree.)</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""right"">""There's something wrong inside you.""</q></p> \n<p>Laurie really wants a dog, but she knows Kevin doesn't want one. Still, she dabbles. In an interesting Oh-that's-how-they're-connected moment, Laurie visits Gladys (Marceline Hugot), who's a dog breeder. In the world of <i>The Leftovers</i>, dogs aren't cute and cuddly; they're raucous and angry and vicious. The contrast between pre- and post-October 14 animals is quite noticeable, and it's also worth mentioning that Gladys's comment about how wonderful dogs are seems foreboding in the most creepy way.</p> \n<p>Further propelling Laurie's gradually unraveling relationship with her husband is her secret pregnancy. If Kevin doesn't want a dog, then she can only imagine how he'll respond to the news of a baby. Pregnancies seem to be an integral component of the mythology of this series, and it'll be interesting to see if and how Laurie's pregnancy is dealt with in the future.</p> \n<p>It's probably worth mentioning that the final shot of the episode does not confirm that the baby vanished from Laurie's body, though it's strongly implied. With Lindelof, however, the camera's implications can be used to distract from what really happened. Given the fact that the ultrasound shot isn't confirmed, coupled with Patti's ominous ""There's something wrong inside you"" and that strange ""It's a girl!"" balloon Kevin finds in the dead deer's antlers, it's probably safe to bet that the final shot of episode nine will have major ramifications for the entire series.</p> \n<h3>Patti</h3> \n<p>At this point, we don't know how long Patti has been seeing Laurie, but the two seem to know each other well enough. Patti feels comfortable expressing herself in front of her therapist, just as she did during her hotel restaurant trip with her. <span>What Patti said to Laurie — ""There's something wrong</span><span> </span><i style=""line-height: 1.5;"">inside you</i><span>"" — is certainly interesting, however</span><span>. </span></p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""left"">""Remember what you told me to do in the last session before everything changed?"" </q></p> \n<p><span>I don't think Patti knows her shrink is pregnant. Then again, Patti doesn't</span><span> </span><i style=""line-height: 1.5;"">know</i><span> what she knows; she feels it. She has bursts of prophetic ""tremors."" She feels deep down in her soul that the world is going to end. Laurie interprets this as a manifestation of Patti's tense relationship with her abusive partner Neil, who recently kicked Patti out of their home. (""He paid for it. It's his house,"" she tells Laurie. When Laurie says, ""That's not how it works,"" you have to wonder what she thinks of her own financial situation with Kevin.) </span></p> \n<p>The reveal of Patti's relationship with Neil was set up wonderfully. <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/7/28/5944241/the-leftovers-episode-5-the-turning-point-of-the-series"">Think back to episode five</a>, ""Gladys,"" when Patti gave Laurie a holiday from silence and smoking. At the end of their meal, Patti asked the waitress for a doggie bag. <span>""Remember what you told me to do in the last session before everything changed?"" she asked Laurie, and wrote down the name </span><i style=""line-height: 1.5;"">Neil</i><span> on the bag. Later in the episode, Patti dropped the bag on the doorstep. We knew she wasn't leaving leftovers — are there really any leftovers on the show? Hasn't everyone departed, in some sense, since October 14? But now we know what was in the bag: all the abusive things Neil said to her. </span></p> \n<p>Patti and Laurie's relationship is fascinating. Before the Departure, Laurie held the power, but the balance has shifted since the Vanishings. Laurie submits to her GR leader probably because she now believes her former client's doomsday preaching. The world did end, and Patti knew it.</p> \n<p><chorus-asset class=""chorus-snippet browser_wide_media"" data-id=""671232""> <img alt=""Jill and Tommy"" class=""small"" src=""http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/671232/772224_TL109s57_061414_PS33313.0.jpg""> </chorus-asset></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Chris Zylka, Margaret Qualley. (Paul Schiraldi/HBO)</p> \n<h3><span>Jill and Tommy</span></h3> \n<p>It was nice to see Tommy (Chris Zylka) and Jill (Margaret Qualley) together. It's clear they love and are devoted to each other. They also love and respect their parents and have been picking up clues that not all is well with mom and dad. ""I think he's gonna leave,"" Jill tells her brother when he asks what she thinks is happening with their family.</p> \n<p>Jill's relationship with her parents has been explored in several other episodes, so it was great to see some of Tommy's backstory with them. We've long known that Tommy isn't Kevin's biological son, but what we didn't know is that Tommy has a habit of getting drunk and sneaking over to see his biological father. Tommy tells his mom he should probably just try and forget about the man. But Laurie tells him, ""As a trained professional, it doesn't work."" In both her pre- and post-October 14 careers, Laurie is a professional rememberer.</p> \n<p>The science fair scene was one of the most captivating moments of the series. I've long wondered how the writers would go about showing the Vanishings without falling down the CGI rabbit hole. The episode nails that image.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""left"">'The garveys at their best' was an explainer that didn't over-explain.</q></p> \n<p>When one of the teachers asks for volunteers to help make a circuit, Tommy volunteers himself and Jill. As they join hands in a circle with several other students, completing the circuit and acting as a conduit for the electricity that will serve to light the oversized light bulb, Tommy makes faces at his sister to get her to laugh. Max Richter's musical motif starts to play in the background, <span>with its usual perfect timing,</span><span> </span><span>and the action slows to a crawl. One of the children from the circuit vanishes, and the light shining on Tommy's face went dark, a beautifully foreboding image.</span></p> \n<p>The last scene of episode nine hearkens back to the last scene of the pilot, in which the the camera flashed from one Garvey to the next as they responded to their grief. In spite of all that's happened to them, this family's members really love each other, and I'm hoping that season one doesn't end without giving us some sort of family reunion, however brief, however tearful.</p> \n<h3><span>Nora</span></h3> \n<p>We knew the writers had to explain that paper towel — and they did! <span> </span></p> \n<p><span>In episode six, we learned Nora kept performing her motherly duties even long after her family departed. She bought gallons of milk and children's cereal, even though she didn't eat any of it. She wouldn't replace the paper towel roll on her kitchen counter. The roll itself was empty, save the remains of a paper sheet that had been pulled off in haste. </span></p> \n<p><span>In the immediate moments following her family's Departure, Nora, wad of paper towels in hand, stood staring at the mess her children just made at the breakfast table. She'd never again have the chance to play supermom, to clean up her children's spills, to beg them to quiet down. That's why, before her encounter with Holy Wayne, she left that roll of paper towels just as it was: it reminded her that she used to be Nora Durst.</span></p> \n<h3>Matt and Mary</h3> \n<p><span>It was nice to finally get to hear from Mary (Janel Moloney). She loves her husband Matt (Christopher Eccleston) and is concerned for his health. As she explains to Laurie (whom she meets in the doctor's office of Laurie's OB/GYN) Matt has been sick since childhood, and every few years, he has a cancer scare. Of course, he puts on a brave face for his wife and doesn't let her go into the doctor's office with him while he hears the news. Laurie understands what it's like to hide your vulnerability from your spouse: ""He's scared. He doesn't want you to see him like that."" As Mary reminds Laurie, for better or for worse, spouses see all the things the other tries to hide from them.</span></p> \n<p>When Matt comes out and gives the good news that he isn't sick, he tells Mary they should go celebrate. ""You get drunk, I'll drive,"" says Mary. It's heartbreaking to think that their time of celebration would be cut short by the accident that left Mary paralyzed. Given the moments leading up to their car wreck, I'm beginning to think that Mary is more of a Job figure than her husband.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""center"">how did the garveys end up this way?</q></p> \n<h3>Ordinary details</h3> \n<p>One of the biggest criticisms of <i>Lost</i> was that Lindelof and fellow creator Carlton Cuse were just flying by the seat of their pants: they weren't really sure what exactly was happening with the Island, and the series suffered slightly because of it. But with <i>The Leftovers</i>, Lindelof seems to have learned his lesson. Episode nine, from a purely literary standpoint, is gold, and it suggests we can trust the writers because they know exactly what they're doing.</p> \n<p>Besides the perfect script, ""The Garveys at Their Best"" is everything you'd want from a television show reveling in mystery: it was, in essence, an explainer that didn't over-explain. How did the Garveys end up this way? What motivated Patti to found the GR? When did Kevin's obsession with deer begin?</p> \n<p><a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2014/06/the-brutal-power-of-the-ordinary-details/373327/"" style=""line-height: 1.5;"">Tom Perrotta has said</a> from the beginning that <i>The Leftovers</i> is a show about ordinary people living ordinary lives when, all of a sudden, on one ordinary day, something inexplicable happens. And the ordinary moments leading up to the Event — paper towels, spilled juice, a foolish affair, a high school science experiment — take on new significance as the characters are forced to confront them in search of meaning or forgiveness or hope. The question episode nine asks of its characters is, where were you on October 14?</p> \n<p>The question episode nine asks of its viewers is, where will you be when your own October 14 happens?</p>",Television

As this chart shows, the cost of this ""transit"" service fell by a factor of 15 between 2008 and 2013.</p> \n<p>Comcast has to buy transit in order to provide its customers with access to the entire internet. But more important, transit service is a helpful proxy for the falling cost of network connectivity more generally. The transit market is highly competitive, with dozens of companies offering service in direct competition. If the residential broadband market were this competitive, we would likely see dramatic improvements there too. Certainly, the per-megabit cost of broadband service should improve faster than 20 percent over 6 years.</p> \n<p>So what's going on? It's hard to know for sure. But it's worth noting that there aren't many applications capable of generating enough data to hit Comcast's current 300 GB limit. By far the most popular is HD video streaming services such as Netflix — which happens to compete with Comcast's own lucrative paid television service.</p> \n<p>And the data caps aren't the only Comcast strategy that happens to hamstring large video streaming services. This spring, Comcast <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/5/6/5678080/voxsplaining-telecom"">used hardball tactics</a> to force Netflix to pay Comcast to deliver videos Comcast's own customers had asked for. This kind of toll makes it more difficult for Netflix to undercut Comcast's pay TV service on price.</p> \n<p>Comcast insists that both measures are simply designed to make heavy users of its network pay their fair share.

It's getting harder and harder to imagine that all of the elements of the show are going to stick together in a way that makes sense, come the finale. The show obviously has four episodes to bring everything in line, and that's a lot of time. But at the same time, it keeps introducing new elements, which is often a sign of a group of writers that isn't sure what it should do next.</p> \n<p>In short: I'm hoping this will all come together, but I'm worried.</p> \n<p>Let's break down the reasons for being worried about this season, starting with...</p> \n<p><chorus-asset class=""chorus-snippet browser_wide_media"" data-id=""676828""> <img alt=""Masters of Sex"" class=""small"" src=""http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/676828/MastersOfSex_208_0910.r.0.jpg""> </chorus-asset></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Bill (Michael Sheen) meets with Francis, a mysterious figure from his past (Christian Borle). (Showtime)</p> \n<h3>1) Is this season going to be <i>about</i> anything?</h3> \n<p>With eight episodes under our belts, the show's many stories essentially have nothing to do with each other. If the first season was about the ways all of our lives are affected by sex in its many facets — among other things — then this season is about what? The co-dependent connection between Bill and Virginia? Libby's battles against racism — both her own and that baked into her society? Flo the Cal-o-Metric woman's business strategies?</p> \n<p>Even when the first season was struggling here and there, it had a thematic backbone that kept things pointed toward a kind of true north. I'm not sure season two has this quality yet, and that means that a reveal like, say, Langham working with Flo as the new spokesman for Cal-o-Metric diet pills mostly elicits groans because it's dumping in some other story that has nothing to do with anything.</p> \n<p>The first season had its share of plotlines that went nowhere and characters that could feel like they added nothing to the proceedings, but it also had the rock-solid foundation of Bill's curiosity about sex, and his and Virginia's struggles to get the study accepted by people at Memorial. This season has nothing like that. In fact, it's essentially rebooted itself three times now, in ways that suggest the writers are casting about for a solid story as well. And even when it has a solid theme, as with the idea of duality and mirroring in tonight's episode, it struggles to really <i>do</i> anything with it.</p> \n<p>But maybe that's because...</p> \n<p><chorus-asset class=""chorus-snippet browser_wide_media"" data-id=""676832""> <img alt=""Masters of Sex"" class=""small"" src=""http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/676832/MastersOfSex_208_0613.r.0.jpg""> </chorus-asset></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Flo (Artemis Pebdani) announces Langham (Teddy Sears) as the new Cal-o-Metric spokesman. Did anybody want this at all? (Showtime)</p> \n<h3>2) There are just too many characters scattered all over.</h3> \n<p>As mentioned, season one had a huge ensemble of characters, too, but outside of Libby, they were united by all working at Memorial (and even she eventually wound up working there). That meant when the show couldn't lean on any of its storylines, it could always revert to a workplace drama about a 1950s hospital. So the flirtation of Lester and Jane, say, could play out as a background story that occasionally gained prominence.</p> \n<p>This season, because the characters are scattered to the winds, the show necessarily needs to cut away to Langham to see what he's up to, or make sure we know what's going on with Libby. Even the Lillian stuff — which mostly worked — took place on its own island. It's had the structural effect of turning <i>Masters of Sex</i> into five or six different shows existing within the same space and jockeying for attention.</p> \n<p>Tonight alone, we had Bill and Virginia's separate stories about combatting sexual inadequacies (stories that brought in yet another new character in Francis, revealed to be Bill's brother at episode's end), Libby's story about the cover-up of a racially-motivated crime, Langham's story about taking a job with Cal-o-Metric, and the story about forming the board of trustees at the clinic. That's five storylines that have essentially nothing to do with each other, outside of a vague idea of buried secrets coming to light, an idea that doesn't carry enough weight to put the episode over.</p> \n<p>After season one, the show probably needed to just cut every character that wasn't Bill, Virginia, or Libby (whom the show needs for reasons I will get to in a moment), then start over. But that wasn't really possible, which has led to the mess we're in.</p> \n<p>Is it possible that ...</p> \n<p><chorus-asset class=""chorus-snippet browser_wide_media"" data-id=""676836""> <img alt=""Masters of Sex"" class=""small"" src=""http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/676836/MastersOfSex_208_0747.r.0.jpg""> </chorus-asset></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Bill and Virginia hope to use their study to cure those with sexual problems. (Showtime)</p> \n<h3>3) The show now works better as a collection of scenes than anything else.</h3> \n<p>Somehow, <i>Masters of Sex</i> has turned into a show that tells stories into one that has individual scenes that awkwardly get juxtaposed with each other. And the show seems <i>aware</i> of this, too. One of the best scenes in tonight's episode, for instance, is when Barbara has the breakthrough and realizes that she used to have sex with her brother, a revelation Virginia is not remotely prepared to handle.</p> \n<p>It's a great scene that has the <i>shape</i> of a story, but it's also not really a story with beginning, middle, and end. And it also leads to Virginia's strange decision to head to the psychiatrist on Barbara's behalf and present Barbara's story as her own. I sort of buy that Virginia would be this desperate to help out that she would do this; I don't buy that she would be so stupid as to think she could get away with this and actually use it to help Barbara through her trauma somehow. I get that both Bill and Virginia are so drawn to each other because they're both people who see their own limitations as gentle suggestions, but this is simply ludicrous in a way the show rarely allows itself to be.</p> \n<p>And that's the case throughout this episode and the season: the scenes try to be stories, but they don't really hook up with each other. That leaves the episodes trying too hard to make them hook up, and creating heavy-handed parts where the characters might as well be turning straight to camera and telling us just what each scene is supposed to signify.</p> \n<p>But you know what?

It's the sort of juicy material that any TV show would love to dig into. <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/8/24/6062737/masters-of-sex-episode-7-recap-review-time-jump"" target=""_blank"">The end of last week's episode</a> hinted at some of this, but we're still a bit too far off from it to really dig into it. And this is mostly at a point when Masters and Johnson were trying to get their sex study off the ground again, which could easily feel repetitive (and has at various points).</p> \n<p>But because of what's coming, the show needs characters like Libby. And that means it needs to find something for them to do, because Showtime isn't going to pay Caitlin FitzGerald to sit around all season and not do anything. This means that she gets diverted into storylines like this season's tale of her realization that, hey, maybe racism is a real thing that exists and maybe she is a little bit racist, too. And that could have worked if the show had really committed to making Buell Green its central setting, <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/8/17/6028785/masters-of-sex-episode-6-recap-review-lines-of-dialogue/in/5664110"" target=""_blank"">but it largely bailed on that</a>, and Libby has felt isolated from everything else for most of the season.</p> \n<p>But the show needs her for future seasons, so she gets a story, even if it sucks.

It's been about the two of them coming together and falling apart and coming together again. And yet the show treats their partnership almost as something it's not that interested in, because it has other things to attend to.</p> \n<p>Have you seen Michael Sheen and Lizzy Caplan's chemistry, show?

Heck, even ""Asterion"" mostly worked, because it could sell Bill and Virginia being separated for what amounted to about three-quarters of one episode as the worst thing that could happen to either of them. Now, the series is drowning itself in standalone stories for both of the characters, with occasional check-ins with them in their hotel room (check-ins interrupted by moments when Bill gets to go look at the corpse of a man who ate himself to death for no particular reason). The series has this powerful, potent thing, and it keeps ignoring it in favor of so much other <i>stuff</i>.</p> \n<p><!--[if gte mso 9]><xml> 0   0   1   1338   7627   Vox Media   63   17   8948   14.0 </xml><![endif]--> <!--[if gte mso 9]><xml> Normal   0               false   false   false      EN-US   JA   X-NONE </xml><![endif]--><!--[if gte mso 9]><xml> </xml><![endif]--> <!--[if gte mso 10]> \n<style> \n /* Style Definitions */ \ntable.MsoNormalTable \n\t{mso-style-name:""Table Normal""; \n\tmso-tstyle-rowband-size:0; \n\tmso-tstyle-colband-size:0; \n\tmso-style-noshow:yes; \n\tmso-style-priority:99; \n\tmso-style-parent:""""; \n\tmso-padding-alt:0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt; \n\tmso-para-margin:0in; \n\tmso-para-margin-bottom:.0001pt; \n\tmso-pagination:widow-orphan; \n\tfont-size:12.0pt; \n\tfont-family:Cambria; \n\tmso-ascii-font-family:Cambria; \n\tmso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin; \n\tmso-hansi-font-family:Cambria; \n\tmso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin;} \n</style> \n<![endif]--></p> \n<p>As I said above, none of this is unfixable.

The last four episodes of the season could tie everything from the eight episodes prior together into a neat little bow that makes me feel foolish for not trusting Ashford and her team. But for any show to work, it needs a center, and <i>Masters of Sex</i> will need to find one soon — or at least use the center it could have in Bill and Virginia's pairing more frequently — if it's not going to write its entire second season off as a wash.</p>",Television
Netflixâ€™s next challenge: how to end a show,http://www.vox.com/2014/9/2/6098785/hemlock-grove-renewed-netflix,Hemlock Grove is renewed for a third and final season.,"<p>There comes a time in every young television provider's life when it must switch from an outlet that starts shows to one that ends them. Sometimes, that results in carefully negotiated endpoints, as with HBO. Sometimes, it results in almost every show going on too long, as with Showtime. And sometimes, it results in a confusing mish-mash of the two, where carefully negotiated endpoints get strung out over multiple years, as with AMC.</p> \n<p>Netflix, then, is aiming more for the ""carefully negotiated endpoint,"" or so it would seem, having announced a renewal of <i>Hemlock Grove</i> for a third and final season of 10 episodes. Honestly, you probably forgot <i>Hemlock Grove</i> even existed, lost as it got between the site's more high-profile content (like <i>House of Cards</i> and <i>Orange Is the New Black</i>). Of Netflix's series, <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.metacritic.com/tv/hemlock-grove"">it has gotten by far the worst reviews</a>.</p> \n<p>What's interesting is that the quotes from Netflix's press release for the renewal don't read like a celebration of triumph but, rather, a show that got renewed by the skin of its teeth at the last minute. Since we'll never know how many people watch Netflix's shows (it refuses to release ratings data), this sort of press release tea leaf reading is the next best thing.</p> \n<p>For example:</p> \n<ul> \n<li>""We are so grateful to the fans of <i>Hemlock Grove</i> who have championed the series so intensely over two seasons,"" said series executive producer Eli Roth.</li> \n<li>""The fan support of <i>Hemlock Grove</i> has been amazing and we are thrilled Netflix recognizes this and is rewarding the fans with a third and final season,"" said Katie O'Connell, CEO of Gaumont Television, which produces the series.</li> \n<li><span>""We are delighted that our fans have invited us back to explore the fiendish recesses of the human condition for another season,"" said executive producer Chic Eglee.</span></li> \n</ul> \n<p>Now, separately, these quotes don't really mean anything. But if you really want to engage in baseless speculation, this much credit is usually only paid to ""the fans"" when a show has a passionate, diehard fanbase that manages to keep resurrecting it year after year.

Plus, that quote from O'Connell would not be out of place in a ""surprise renewal for a final season of a beloved cult show"" press release.</p> \n<p>But, then, Netflix put together this press release and is unlikely to be interested in even vaguely suggesting viewership data, so we could be incredibly wrong.</p> \n<p><!--[if gte mso 9]><xml> 0   0   1   342   1950   Vox Media   16   4   2288   14.0 </xml><![endif]--> <!--[if gte mso 9]><xml> Normal   0               false   false   false      EN-US   JA   X-NONE </xml><![endif]--><!--[if gte mso 9]><xml> </xml><![endif]--> <!--[if gte mso 10]> \n<style> \n /* Style Definitions */ \ntable.MsoNormalTable \n\t{mso-style-name:""Table Normal""; \n\tmso-tstyle-rowband-size:0; \n\tmso-tstyle-colband-size:0; \n\tmso-style-noshow:yes; \n\tmso-style-priority:99; \n\tmso-style-parent:""""; \n\tmso-padding-alt:0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt; \n\tmso-para-margin:0in; \n\tmso-para-margin-bottom:.0001pt; \n\tmso-pagination:widow-orphan; \n\tfont-size:12.0pt; \n\tfont-family:Cambria; \n\tmso-ascii-font-family:Cambria; \n\tmso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin; \n\tmso-hansi-font-family:Cambria; \n\tmso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin;} \n</style> \n<![endif]--></p> \n<p>Season three of <i>Hemlock Grove</i> will premiere next year.</p>",Television

Some weeks, being a series of scenes has made the show feel incredibly disconnected as storytelling. But on other weeks, when those scenes are good enough, the show becomes richer <i>because</i> it's made up of smaller bits and pieces of larger stories. Not everything in tonight's episode, ""The Story of My Life,"" works, but there are enough powerful scenes that it's a marked improvement over last week's episode (and the latest piece of evidence in my budding theory that this season is at its best in its odd-numbered episodes).</p> \n<p>The episode centers on a lot of things — the weight of the truth, the responsibility of parents, the way people view shared history differently — so perhaps the best way to consider it is via some of its best scenes, rather than as a whole. Here are a handful of them.</p> \n<h3>Virginia goes to therapy</h3> \n<p>These are technically two scenes in the midst of everything else, but they immediately reveal that the show, and the characters, are at least somewhat aware that the idea of Virginia going to therapy to get ideas on how to treat Barbara (by passing Barbara's story off as her own) is ridiculous. That's reassuring, as it means the show hasn't <i>totally</i> taken leave of its senses. The scenes are also helped by placing Lizzy Caplan in the same room as the great character actor John Billingsley, who turns the therapist into a man who starts poking holes in Virginia's affect almost immediately.</p> \n<p>Now, the notion of someone going to therapy for some other reason, then ending up talking about themselves anyway, is as old as dramatic depictions of talk therapy. But <i>Masters of Sex</i> has often been a show that works much better when it behaves more like a stage play than a TV series, and that means the therapy scenes gain power just from the fact of what they are: two people sitting in a room and talking to each other.</p> \n<p>In particular, the second scene is terrific. I like the way director Jeremy Webb instinctively knows exactly when to cut away from Caplan's face, as the therapist quietly asks Virginia why she continues to sleep with Bill when Libby is her friend. (He knows nothing of the real situation, but you can still see the way in which Virginia feels troubled by what he says.) I've become so fond of Caplan's unconventional line readings — she never places the emphasis quite where you expect her to — that it's easy to forget just how good she is at the smaller parts of her technique. But the way she navigates the tiny shifts in Virginia's mood in this scene speak to how willfully Virginia's blinded herself, and the scene gets bonus points for invoking Lillian's memory without being maudlin.</p> \n<p><chorus-asset data-id=""688634"" class=""chorus-snippet browser_wide_media""> <img src=""http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/688634/MastersOfSex_209_0225.r.0.jpg"" class=""small"" alt=""Masters of Sex""> </chorus-asset></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Robert (Jocko Sims) confronts Libby (Caitlin Fitzgerald) about what she's actually willing to do. (Showtime)</p> \n<h3>Libby visits CORE</h3> \n<p>The ""Libby Masters explores the depths of mid-20th century racism and/or has a kind of crush on Robert"" storyline continues to be the messiest thing about the season, an attempt to give the character complexity that keeps shying away, at the last possible moment, from doing anything of the sort. So the scenes where she agrees to appear as a witness, testifying to the terrible events she saw last week, are kind of lumpy — even if they have an intriguing moral quandary at their center. (The CORE lawyer and Robert want Libby to lie about exactly what she saw, to make their case better.)</p> \n<p>But the scene where Libby and Robert talk through her testimony is solid, as these things go. The season's grand master plan seems to be throwing in Libby's face just how little she understands her own privilege, and how much she's benefited from being who she is. (I also like how this episode flips that on its head, to remind us that Libby is drastically limited in what she can do in her society, simply by virtue of the fact that she's a woman who's ""expected"" to behave a certain way.) Robert does a fair amount of that in this scene, asking her just what she'd ever have to have lied about, and how important it is that she gets this one right.</p> \n<p>It's the right kind of complicated. Technically, what Libby is being asked to do is wrong, but it's for a cause that's just. Which outweighs the other? Libby ultimately can't lie, but she still ends up volunteering for CORE. Regardless of why, Libby is lurching her way toward an understanding of what's wrong in her world.</p> \n<p><chorus-asset data-id=""688636"" class=""chorus-snippet browser_wide_media""> <img src=""http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/688636/MastersOfSex_209_0555.r.0.jpg"" class=""small"" alt=""Masters of Sex""> </chorus-asset></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Francis (Christian Borle) shares a painful story from his past. (Showtime)</p> \n<h3>Frank at Alcoholics Anonymous</h3> \n<p>I'm still not entirely sure why Bill's long-estranged brother Francis is a part of the show now, considering how thoroughly their estrangement rests on the characters telling us it happened. But Christian Borle is so good in the role, and he and Michael Sheen have such instant, prickly chemistry, that I find myself not really minding, even as I can feel the wheels turning to make all of this relevant.</p> \n<p>The notion of Bill's terrible upbringing has been one of the few constants this season, and the show gains potency every time it returns to it. ""The Story of My Life"" actually finds a way to back into telling that story: Frank drags his brother to an AA meeting, where he plans to share the story of his addiction. That story is a long, writerly monologue that (again) wouldn't be out of place in a stage play, but that's also what's so great about it. Writer Amy Lippman (also credited for the script on <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/7/27/5942875/masters-of-sex-episode-3-one-of-the-best-episodes-of-tv-this-year/in/5664110"" target=""_blank"">the season's best episode, ""Fight""</a>) constructs a lovely little speech for him, one that sets up the idea of ""disappearing"" as central to the boys' upbringing.</p> \n<p>It pays off in the moment when Bill disappears. He later reveals that he's convinced Frank appropriated Bill's childhood suffering for his own story. But, of course, both boys struggled with a terrible father, in very different ways; Bill didn't quite realize that, since he abandoned his younger brother. ""Story of My Life"" has to do a lot of work in order to retroactively justify bringing Francis into the story. It doesn't get all of the way there, but this scene comes so close to doing so that it works anyway.</p> \n<h3>Barbara goes to see her brother</h3> \n<p>Another way that <i>Masters</i> succeeds in a fashion similar to a stage play is the amount of scenes in which we are told about an encounter, rather than seeing it happen. This is the case with Barbara's story tonight, which involves her going to see her brother and confronting him about their sexual encounters as children. If the show is shifting its focus slightly to be about Bill and Virginia's attempts to treat sexual issues, instead of simply acknowledge they exist, then this is a good way to show the potential limits of that approach.</p> \n<p>Treating sexual issues might require a physical component, but there's also an important psychological side. Virginia intuitively understands that, but she's improperly trained to deal with them. Barbara, for instance, takes Virginia's suggestion to imagine what her younger self wants to say to her brother as an actual suggestion to go talk to her brother — something that only causes Barbara more pain, when she comes to realize that there's every possibility she was the one who suggested the two have sex in the first place.</p> \n<p>And if nothing else, this is the scene that will be the centerpiece of Betsy Brandt's Emmy campaign. It wasn't immediately clear why the show brought in an actress of her caliber earlier in the season, but it ended up working in the show's favor. Wondering just why she was there made it easier to remember her when she resurfaced a couple of episodes ago; the quality of her acting has made these stories feel not salacious, as they might have on another show, but riddled with deep-seated pain.</p> \n<p><chorus-asset data-id=""688638"" class=""chorus-snippet browser_wide_media""> <img src=""http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/688638/MastersOfSex_209_0728.r.0.jpg"" class=""small"" alt=""Masters of Sex""> </chorus-asset></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Bill and Virginia meet again in the hotel room. (Showtime)</p> \n<h3>The final scene</h3> \n<p>So much of this season has boiled down to Bill and Virginia in a hotel room, carrying on an affair that once had a veneer of being ""for science."" The final scene sends both characters' stories crashing into each other: Virginia finally confronts Bill with her misgivings, with her concerns that what they're doing would destroy Libby if she found out. Bill can claim that he's doing everything without hopes of hurting anybody as much as he likes, but as we've seen with Francis, he's so relentlessly focused on himself that these good intentions don't matter.</p> \n<p>What's more, this allows the show to rope in the ""cure"" side of things with the story of Bill and Virginia's affair. The irony is that by embarking on an attempt to cure Bill's impotence, the two will only increase Virginia's guilt over what's happened. If they're able to have sex again, that means they've ""succeeded,"" which would mean that there's no real scientific reason for the affair to continue. The two are trapped, and they might even know it. But there's simply no way they're going to stop what they're doing.</p> \n<p><!--[if gte mso 9]><xml> 0   0   1   1336   7617   Vox Media   63   17   8936   14.0 </xml><![endif]--> <!--[if gte mso 9]><xml> Normal   0               false   false   false      EN-US   JA   X-NONE </xml><![endif]--><!--[if gte mso 9]><xml> </xml><![endif]--> <!--[if gte mso 10]> \n<style> \n /* Style Definitions */ \ntable.MsoNormalTable \n\t{mso-style-name:""Table Normal""; \n\tmso-tstyle-rowband-size:0; \n\tmso-tstyle-colband-size:0; \n\tmso-style-noshow:yes; \n\tmso-style-priority:99; \n\tmso-style-parent:""""; \n\tmso-padding-alt:0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt; \n\tmso-para-margin:0in; \n\tmso-para-margin-bottom:.0001pt; \n\tmso-pagination:widow-orphan; \n\tfont-size:12.0pt; \n\tfont-family:Cambria; \n\tmso-ascii-font-family:Cambria; \n\tmso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin; \n\tmso-hansi-font-family:Cambria; \n\tmso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin;} \n</style> \n<![endif]--></p> \n<p>That, in a way, is the message of ""The Story of My Life.""

"The Leftovers, Episode 10: Why do bad things happen to good people?",http://www.vox.com/2014/9/8/6121495/the-leftovers-episode-10-why-do-bad-things-happen-to-good-people,The season one finale of 'The Leftovers' was surprisingly cathartic.,"<p><span>Who is good? What is goodness? Why do good people suffer? </span></p> \n<p><span>This entire season of </span><i style=""line-height: 1.5;"">The Leftovers </i><span>has explored these questions, but episode 10 brings them to the forefront. The writers have already given us several references to the Book of Job — a Jewish epic poem that deals with these questions on a cosmic scale — but during the finale,</span><b style=""line-height: 1.5;""> </b><span>we are treated to a gut-wrenching recitation of a lengthy portion from Job 23.</span></p> \n<p><iframe frameborder=""0"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/rBZDj4nTFNY"" height=""315"" width=""560""></iframe></p> \n<p><span></span><span>When biblical Job's entire family is taken away from him in an instant, he is forced to try and make sense of their Departure. His misfortune is surprising. Job is a righteous man — even God compliments his blameless character — so it doesn't make sense that he would be so unjustly punished. Job's friends point this out to him and offer him their various takes on Job's conundrum, which are mostly theological riffs that all amount to victim-blaming: </span><i style=""line-height: 1.5;"">Look, Job, God would not have punished you like this if you didn't sin. Repent of your wrongdoing, and God will make the evil go away</i><span>.</span></p> \n<p>Of course,<i> </i>the writer makes it very clear that Job's friends are wrong, and God scolds them for their answers. But most surprisingly, rather than answer Job's own questions, God responds rather cruelly with a soliloquy contrasting his infinite power with Job's human weakness. ""Where were you when I laid the foundations of the earth?"" God asks Job. The book ends with Job recognizing that he is not on par with God, and therefore, was wrong to demand answers for his suffering.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""left"">whys ultimately do not matter in 'job,' just like they do not matter in 'the leftovers'</q></p> \n<p>The Book of Job has long puzzled theologians. The epic poem presumes to tackle the questions of why bad things happen to good people. Though the text offers some answers to these questions, Job is ultimately about another question altogether.<i> </i>""Why did something bad happen to someone good?"" becomes ""What is a good person to do about it?"" Whys ultimately do not matter in Job<i>, </i>just like they don't ultimately matter in <i>The Leftovers</i>. What matters to both stories is how the ordinary characters respond to their lot. Their stakes are real, and what they decide matters greatly in the grand design of the cosmos. After all, God might not be answering questions, but he is certainly lurking about in the background watching the characters' every move.</p> \n<h3>Is he a jolly, good fellow?</h3> \n<p>Episode 10, titled ""The Prodigal Son Returns,"" opens where episode eight left off, in the aftermath of Patti's (Ann Dowd) suicide. The first shot reveals Kevin's (Justin Theroux) face reflected in a pool of Patti's blood. The camera then flashes to Patti's opened, lifeless eyes, before revolving away from her body, winding upwards in a way that called back the moment in episode eight when she stood by the clothes of Mapleton's Departed, making final preparations for the GR's most audacious stunt to date.</p> \n<p><chorus-asset class=""chorus-snippet browser_wide_media"" data-id=""689324""> <img alt=""772225_TL110s1_061914_PS34011.0.jpg"" class=""small"" src=""http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/689324/772225_TL110s1_061914_PS34011.0.jpg""> </chorus-asset></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Justin Theroux. (Paul Schiraldi/HBO)</p> \n<p>Kevin mindlessly holds Patti's cigarette bag in his hand, undoubtedly wondering what will happen next. Who is going to believe that Patti killed herself? He, after all, is the one that brought her to this cabin in Cairo — he certainly appears guilty enough. Kevin takes out a cigarette and smokes it just like he did in that same cabin as a young boy, when he would sneak away from summer camp to be by himself.</p> \n<p>Kevin is alone. Laurie, Tom, Jill, Papa Garvey, Dean, Nora, Patti — all of them are gone. <span>There is only one person Kevin thinks he can count on: Matt (Christopher Eccleston). The priest shows up prepared with shovels and a change of clothes — has he done this before? — and helps Kevin dispose of Patti's body. Matt has a talk with Kevin and reminds him he's ""a good man."" </span></p> \n<p><span>The camera then flashes to the party Kevin threw for his dad in an earlier episode, </span><span>to the moment when the attendees sang ""For he's a jolly good fellow."" </span><i style=""line-height: 1.5;"">Is Kevin a good fellow?</i><span> we thought as Kevin watched his family rejoicing, the same family he didn't seem contented with.</span></p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""right"">is kevin a jolly, good fellow?</q></p> \n<p>After their mock funeral for Patti, Matt offers Kevin a change of clothes and some fresh water to bathe himself with. Kevin takes the water, and washes his hands and body with it, calling back to the baptisms Matt performed in episode three, for both his wife and his church member's baby. But this time, Matt was not the one performing the rite. He was simply watching it being done before him, much like he watched Kevin just moments before recite a passage of Scripture. Matt is becoming less a pastor who performs sacred duties and more a pastor who encourages people to perform these duties for themselves.</p> \n<p>This is further explored in a later scene when Kevin confesses his guilt to Father Matt, who never offers him forgiveness. Granted, he tells Kevin, ""It's not your fault,"" when Kevin intimates that his dissatisfaction with his family somehow had a hand in the Departure. Kevin then recalls finding Tom and Jill distraught at school on October 14, and how happy they were they saw him alive. He was almost embarrassed to tell Matt they were happy — as if it were difficult to believe his own children could have had more faith in him than he had in himself.</p> \n<p>It's no secret that Kevin is spiraling out of control. He has difficulty controlling himself during his sleeping states. For that matter, what <i>are</i> his sleeping states? Who is the real Kevin: The one who kidnaps Patti, or the one who unties her the following day? The one who shoots dogs or the one who pets them, as he did at the end of the episode while walking hand in hand with his daughter? Is the real Kevin the one who gets thrown in the same mental institution as his father where he confronts a posthumous Patti, or the one who doesn't buy his father's spiel about the magical significance of the May 1972 issue of <i>National Geographic</i>?</p> \n<p>When reading Job, the question we want to ask is, <i>Where is God during all of this suffering?</i> But the real question is, <i>Where is Job during his suffering? </i>Similarly, <i>The Leftovers </i>doesn't ask where God is during Kevin's suffering, but rather, where Kevin is during his own suffering. Will he show up to his own pain? Will he face his own dissatisfaction? Who knows if Kevin believes in God. The point is, he doesn't even seem to believe in himself.</p> \n<p><chorus-asset class=""chorus-snippet browser_wide_media"" data-id=""689326""> <img alt=""Laurie.0.jpg"" class=""small"" src=""http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/689326/Laurie.0.jpg""> </chorus-asset></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Margaret Qualley, Amy Brenneman. (Paul Schiraldi/HBO)</p> \n<h3>TALK</h3> \n<p>One of the most intense moments of the finale was the fire montage, when Kevin realizes his daughter is trapped in the burning GR house. At the end of episode eight, we saw Jill (Margaret Qualley) show up to GR headquarters asking to move in. Laurie (Amy Brenneman) wasn't happy about it, and continued to persuade her daughter to leave in episode ten. ""WHY?"" Laurie writes on her pad, wanting to know why her daughter would give up her life for the GR. Jill replies with her own scribbled message for her mother: ""TALK."" When Laurie refuses, Jill changes into white. ""At least you'll be together,"" writes Meg, and with that, Laurie sends the GR off on their mission.</p> \n<p>As Mapleton sleeps, the GR takes the mannequins delivered to them in episode eight, and puts them exactly where the people they are meant to represent disappeared from on October 14. Understandably, this sets off riots in Mapleton. The GR members are seized and beaten, and their homes are set on fire. Kevin finds Laurie as she is being dragged out of the house and he rescues her from her would-be assaulter. As he tries to take her to safety, she refuses to leave and begins to do something she hasn't done for months: talk.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""left"">'the leftovers' doesn't ask where god is during kevin's suffering, but rather, where is kevin during his own suffering?</q></p> \n<p>""Ji — "" she struggles to get the word out. Her voice sounds hoarse and rough, just as you'd expect from someone who hasn't exercised her vocal cords in a long time. Finally, summoning all of her strength, she grabs Kevin's face and shouts, ""JILL!"" and points to the house. <span>A few moments earlier, Jill tried to get her mother to talk. And though she may never know it, she actually succeeded. In the face of death, Laurie laid aside her vow of silence, just like Gladys did when she was being stoned. But rather than plead for her own life, which is what Gladys did, Laurie pleaded for her daughter's.<i> </i>Earlier this season, Jill gave her mom a lighter engraved with the words <i>Don't forget me</i>. </span></p> \n<p>Laurie didn't.</p> \n<p>Unfortunately, even as Laurie is warming back up to her family, Nora (Carrie Coon) is becoming familiar with them, too. And as we learn in the finale, she thinks she loves Kevin. For a while there, things with the two of them seemed to be moving to a nice place. But when she wakes up to the mannequins of her departed family members, she realizes that she wasn't actually ready to move on. That's because, as she writes in a note to Kevin — which, at first I thought was suicide note! — there isn't really any moving on. Even if you do leave your grief, she says, when you finally return home, you find your family right there where you left them. (Grief is like a dead-end, in other words, which certainly adds a new dimension to the GR's homes, which are located in a cul-de-sac.)</p> \n<p>But just when it seems like Kevin — and we — are never to hear from Nora again, she discovers Baby Wayne right where Tom (Chris Zylka) left her on his father's porch and finds a new reason for staying around Mapleton. ""Look what I found,"" a smiling Nora tells Kevin, and we wonder if the new child can replace what she lost. <span>Another thing to remember is, though it seems like Nora, Kevin, Jill, and Baby Wayne are going to be a happy family, Holy Wayne's baby is still … Holy Wayne's baby. There's something slightly ominous about her, even if she is adorable. And given all the references to Antichrist the show has dropped, I'm just a bit concerned that the baby will end up being like her father.</span></p> \n<p><chorus-asset class=""chorus-snippet browser_wide_media"" data-id=""689336""> <img alt=""TL110s51_062414_PS35468.0.jpg"" class=""small"" src=""http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/689336/TL110s51_062414_PS35468.0.jpg""> </chorus-asset></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Carrie Coon. (Paul Schiraldi/HBO)</p> \n<h3>Return</h3> \n<p><span>The season one finale of </span><i style=""line-height: 1.5;"">The Leftovers</i><span> was not what you might have expected. There were no looming cliffhangers, no surprise deaths. There were no crazy plot twists. And, rather happily, long-awaited reunions — like Tom and Laurie — finally came to pass. I, for one, was surprised. For a show that has a reputation for didn't-see-that-coming moments, </span><i style=""line-height: 1.5;"">The Leftovers</i><span>' finale contained a healthy dose of now-that's-what-I-was-hoping-fors. There were obviously dark moments, and a few surprises, but the general feeling I had once the closing credits started to roll was satisfaction.</span></p> \n<p>Of course, not all loose ends were tied up, and the series left a few open questions for us to think about going into season two.</p> \n<ul> \n<li><span>Is all of this stuff actually happening? Is Kevin ""dreaming"" any (or most) of this? That would be a storytelling copout in a way, but it might also help explain some of the bigger questions of the show, like the voices he and his father hear, and his hallucinations (like his dry cleaning).</span></li> \n<li><span>What. The heck. With Baby Wayne? Is Holy Wayne somehow special? Does he actually heal people with his hugs? Can he really grant wishes? And speaking of wishes, what do you think Kevin wished for in the bathroom with Wayne? I'm guessing it had to do with being reunited with Tom, which would both explain Wayne's knowing smile and call back to the episode's title. </span></li> \n<li><span>What do those dogs represent? And why, after the night of riots, are the vicious dogs now docile and kind? </span></li> \n<li><span>Is Dean gone? Like, really gone? </span></li> \n</ul> \n<p><span>The biggest question, though, has to do with the title of the finale. At the beginning of the episode, a French song played on Christine's headphones, titled </span><i style=""line-height: 1.5;"">Ne me quitte pas</i><span>, which translates to ""Do not leave me."" That is certainly a fitting song for </span><i style=""line-height: 1.5;"">The Leftovers</i><span>. And it's also very appropriate for the finale, which took as its starting point the Gospel parable of the Prodigal Son. </span></p> \n<p><span>In that story, a man's son demands his inheritance money, then runs away and blows it. After running out of money, he decides to return to his father and beg for grace. (The church van, by the way, that Tom sees belongs to Grace Church.) His father, rather than being angry with him, is elated that his son has returned, and acts as if he never left. ""My son was lost, and is found,"" he says. </span></p> \n<p><span>The question we have to think about before season two is, who is the prodigal son? The most obvious answer is Tom. He's returned to Mapleton and reunited with his mother. At the same time, though, he and Laurie haven't yet returned to Jill and Kevin, and I'm not sure they plan to. So maybe Tom isn't the son referenced in the title. </span><span>Maybe the returning son is Kevin. After all, when his father leaves him alone with Patti's horny ghost (is it a ghost?), Kevin becomes scared and cries for his daddy. The Prodigal could also be Jill: she's no longer a GR pledge. And of course, the script gave us another option. ""Look what I found,"" said Nora, Baby Wayne in arms, sounding very much like the father from the Gospel story.</span></p> \n<div>\n<q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""left"">""my son was lost, and is found""</q> \n<p>Or maybe, in a meta sense, the Prodigal is the series itself — after all, <i>The Leftovers</i> is returning in a year.</p> \n<p>Regardless of who the Prodigal is, the fact remains that there was a sense of return and healing to the finale. It was a very cathartic hour of television. Without erasing every question mark the series has established, <i>The Leftovers</i> found a way of speaking gently to its viewers. Questions of suffering remain, as does the palpable pain every character feels. But it's nice to know that, going into season two, the fractured Garvey family is slightly more whole.</p> \n</div>",Television

Big Cable's big problem in the net neutrality debate: everyone hates them,http://www.vox.com/2014/9/12/6137019/big-cables-problem-is-that-everyone-hates-them,Cable companies have some decent arguments against stronger network neutrality regulations. But the industry is so unpopular that the arguments are falling on deaf ears.,"<p>On Wednesday, a number of websites <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/9/10/6132017/netflix-reddit-and-other-sites-are-slowing-down-to-protest-net"">""slowed down""</a> in a symbolic protest of the Federal Communications Commission's proposed network neutrality rules, which many critics say won't do enough to protect network neutrality. The protest generated the largest volume of comments the FCC has ever received on one issue for a simple reason: people <i>really</i> hate their cable company.</p> \n<p><span>A growing number of network neutrality supporters are pushing for something telecom insiders call ""reclassification."" That's a legal maneuver that would expand the FCC's authority to regulate broadband providers. In the past, opponents have successfully painted reclassification as the ""nuclear option"" of telecommunications law, arguing it would expose the internet to excessive regulation. But the FCC now faces more pressure than ever to push the red button.</span></p> \n<p>The critics have some decent arguments. Reclassification would be a big change, and it could subject the internet to some intrusive and counterproductive regulations. Advocates say the FCC could use a legal technique called forbearance to avoid enforcing the most harmful regulations, but it's not clear how much forbearance the courts would allow. More fundamentally, it's not obvious how to translate the principle of network neutrality into a clear and enforceable regulatory language.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""center""><span>Reclassification would be a big change, and it could subject the internet to some intrusive and counterproductive regulations</span></q></p> \n<p>But those arguments haven't gained much traction with the public. Last week the Sunlight Foundation <a href=""http://sunlightfoundation.com/blog/2014/09/02/what-can-we-learn-from-800000-public-comments-on-the-fccs-net-neutrality-plan/"">analyzed </a>800,000 comments submitted to the FCC and found that about two-thirds advocated reclassification. Less than five percent opposed regulation altogether. Yesterday the net neutrality docket <a href=""http://www.politico.com/story/2014/09/fcc-net-neutrality-record-110818.html"">broke the record</a> for the number of comments to the FCC on one issue — the previous record-holder was a proceeding on Janet Jackson's nipple appearing on television during a Super Bowl halftime show in 2004.</p> \n<h3>People hate their cable company</h3> \n<p>Why has the debate proven so one-sided? I think the reason is simple: people hate their cable company. Internet service providers and cable television companies are the two <a href=""http://arstechnica.com/business/2014/05/comcast-time-warner-cable-still-have-the-angriest-customers-survey-finds/"">least popular industries</a> in the American economy, and the two biggest cable companies, Comcast and Time Warner, are the <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/5/20/5734252/consumers-rate-comcast-and-time-warner-the-worst-broadband-and-tv"">least popular companies</a> in these industries.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""right""><span>Big cable companies seem to go out of their way to stoke this kind of hatred</span></q></p> \n<p>This means that any time the nation's biggest cable companies get involved in a policy dispute, the public instinctively takes the other side. Most people don't have an informed opinion on the merits of reclassification or the feasibility of forbearance. But many strongly believe, from personal experience, that cable companies will do anything to make a buck.</p> \n<p>Big cable companies seem to go out of their way to stoke this kind of hatred.

In 1913, AT&amp;T sent a letter, known as the Kingsbury Commitment after the AT&amp;T executive who drafted it, to the Wilson administration. In this letter, AT&amp;T offered to make certain public-interest commitments if the government ended its antitrust investigation.</p> \n<p>The resulting regime wasn't perfect by any means. But Vail's conception of AT&amp;T as a different kind of company — one that had obligations to the public as well as its shareholders — helped to give America one of the best telephone systems in the world. And in the long run, this approach probably benefitted AT&amp;T shareholders too: by improving the company's standing with the public, the strategy helped to ward off hostile government regulation.</p> \n<p>In contrast, today's telecommunications companies seem determined to squeeze every ounce of profits out of their dominant positions. Consumers are tired of it, and they're increasingly pressuring their elected officials to do something about it.</p>",Television
Why the US wouldn't pay ransom to save James Foley from ISIS,http://www.vox.com/2014/9/15/6141283/foley-ransom-obama-isis-family,The reports that the US government threatened James Foley's family if they tried to ransom him back are disturbing. They're also connected to a broader US policy on ransoms.,"<p>A September 12 <a href=""http://abcnews.go.com/International/government-threatened-foley-family-ransom-payments-mother-slain/story?id=25453963&amp;singlePage=true"">ABC News</a> story made a pretty big allegation: that the US government threatened the family of James Foley, one of the two American journalists murdered by the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS). According to ABC, which quotes Foley's mother and brother as well as US government sources, ""<span>Obama administration officials repeatedly threatened the family of murdered journalist James Foley that they might face criminal charges for supporting terrorism</span><span> if they paid ransom.""</span></p> \n<p>The allegations have became a major source of criticism for the administration. On Sunday, White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough went on Fox News to <a href=""http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/mcdonough-we-didnt-threaten-families"">defend</a> the administration's conduct, saying ""We didn't threaten anybody, but we made clear what the law is. That's our responsibility to make sure we explain the law and uphold the law.""</p> \n<p>It's true that US law prohibits giving money or support to designated terrorist groups, but, according to <a href=""http://www.voanews.com/content/debate-arises-over-ransom-to-terror-groups/2437097.html"">Voice of America</a>, ""no individual or company has been subjected to legal sanctions because of paying ransom to terrorist organizations in exchange for a family member or employee."" But it's also true that the US opposes paying ransoms for kidnapped Americans, even if it usually doesn't prosecute people who pay them. Here's why:</p> \n<h3>Ransoms fund terrorism</h3> \n<p><chorus-asset class=""chorus-snippet browser_wide_media"" data-id=""675136""> <img alt=""al-Qaeda in Iraq fighters"" class=""small"" src=""http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/675136/Iraqi_insurgents_with_guns_2006.0.JPG""> </chorus-asset></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Anti-American Iraqi insurgents in 2006. (<a href=""http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Iraqi_insurgents_with_guns.JPG"">Menendj</a>)</p> \n<p>This is, of course, the obvious point. When you pay terrorists money or release imprisoned operatives in exchange for a citizens, a terrorist group gets something it wants. Hostage-taking and ransom payments are incredibly important to the international Islamist terrorist movement.</p> \n<p>In a July investigation, the <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/30/world/africa/ransoming-citizens-europe-becomes-al-qaedas-patron.html"">New York Times</a>' Rukmini Callimachi uncovered clear evidence that several European governments, unlike the United States, had a policy of paying ransom demands. According to Callimachi, ""Al Qaeda and its direct affiliates have taken in at least $125 million in revenue from kidnappings since 2008, of which $66 million was paid just last year.""</p> \n<p>European governments naturally deny all of this, but Callimachi's evidence, including direct quotes from officials and internal al-Qaeda documents, is pretty damning.</p> \n<p>The $125 million figure is even scarier than it seems on paper. ""Counterterrorism officials now believe [al-Qaeda] finances the bulk of its recruitment, training and arms purchases from ransoms paid to free Europeans,"" Callimachi reports. ""Put more bluntly, Europe has become an inadvertent underwriter of Al Qaeda.""</p> \n<h3>And paying the ransom may be counterproductive</h3> \n<p><chorus-asset class=""chorus-snippet browser_wide_media"" data-id=""696626""> <img alt=""US navy hostage training"" class=""small"" src=""http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/696626/us_navy_hostage_training.0.jpg""> </chorus-asset></p> \n<p class=""caption"">US Navy personnel practice hostage-rescue missions. (<a href=""http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:US_Navy_060510-N-5330L-336_A_Sailor_simulating_crazed_husband_holds_a_gun_on_his_wife_during_a_training_exercise_for_Sailors_assigned_to_Mobile_Inshore_Undersea_Warfare.jpg"">Matthew D. Leistikow/US Navy</a>)</p> \n<p>Paying ransoms also tends to backfire: once a ransom gets paid, the terrorist group has an incentive to take more hostages from your country. After all, if they got what they wanted from a government the first time, why wouldn't it pay up again?</p> \n<p>There's pretty good empirical evidence behind this theory. Patrick Brandt and Todd Sandler, professors at the University of Texas at Dallas, <a href=""http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016189380900012X"">examined</a> a dataset of 1941 terrorist kidnappings from 1965 through 2005. One of the questions they looked at was whether paying ransoms made future kidnappings more likely.</p> \n<p>It did. ""Past concessions have the strongest impact on generating future kidnapping events, supporting the conventional wisdom to abide by a stated no-concession policy,"" they write. Specifically, ""each successful negotiation results on average in 2.62 additional abductions over time.""</p> \n<p>So if a country's goal is to prevent its citizens from being kidnapped by terrorist groups, the smartest thing to do is to set a policy that you won't pay ransoms. The more terrorist groups think you'll pay up, the more likely they are to abduct your people.</p> \n<h3>This is all cold comfort to the Foley family</h3> \n<p><chorus-asset class=""chorus-snippet browser_wide_media"" data-id=""696744""> <img alt=""james foley"" class=""small"" src=""http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/696744/James_Foley_in_2011.0.jpg""> </chorus-asset></p> \n<p class=""caption"">James Foley in a television interview in 2011. (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Foley_(journalist)#mediaviewer/File:James_Foley_in_2011.jpg"">Green Cardamom/CNN</a>)</p> \n<p>In Foley's case, it's not clear that there was a ransom that Foley's family could have paid: after ISIS murdered Foley, the group threatened to kill another captured journalist, Steven Sotloff, unless the US stopped bombing in Iraq (a threat ISIS <a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/things-about-isis-you-need-to-know/james-foley-isis"">horribly followed through on</a>). If ISIS' ransom demand was an end to the war, then Foley's family couldn't have delivered.</p> \n<p>So for all that its policy made sense, the US government may have been implicitly threatening a family over a ransom possibility that was hypothetical at best. And the larger implications of paying a ransom to terrorists probably didn't mean a lot to the Foley family while their loved one was imprisoned by a vicious group. A policy against paying ransoms makes sense — but making the family of a captured journalist feel like criminals does not.</p>",Television

One internet company is letting its customers' internet service slow to a crawl,http://www.vox.com/2014/10/2/6880137/slow-lanes-already-exist-on-the-internet,Congestion statistics from Level 3 suggest that big broadband providers are demanding cash to deliver traffic to their own customers â€” and letting customers' service slow down if they don't pay up.,"<p>The network neutrality debate is often framed as a dispute over ""fast lanes."" Net neutrality supporters warn that regulations are needed to stop big broadband providers from creating a two-tier internet, where websites that can afford it pay for their sites to load faster, while everyone else's content is relegated to the slow lane. Advocates say the Federal Communications Commission needs to act now to prevent this from happening.</p> \n<p>But paid fast lanes and unpaid slow lanes are not just a theoretical issue. They already exist, and consumers are suffering as a result.</p> \n<p>The latest evidence of this comes from <a href=""http://blog.level3.com/open-internet/not-neutrality/"">these charts</a>, provided by a networking company called Level 3:</p> \n<p><chorus-asset data-id=""2315416"" class=""chorus-snippet browser_wide_media""> <img src=""http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2315416/lec123.0.jpg"" class=""small"" alt=""lec123.0.jpg""></chorus-asset></p> \n<p>Level 3 operates a big part of the internet's backbone: long-distance lines that carry internet traffic across the country and around the world. Traditionally, broadband providers paid backbone providers to carry their traffic to other ISPs. But lately, at least two of the largest broadband providers — Comcast and Verizon — have begun demanding that backbone providers <i>pay them</i> to deliver content their own customers have requested.</p> \n<p>When Level 3 interconnects with a big broadband provider such as Comcast, Verizon, or AT&amp;T, they typically do so at many different locations around the country. For example, there might be connection points in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, etc. In this chart, each box represents one of those connections. The chart shows how congested Level 3's connections are to three unnamed ISPs in various cities.</p> \n<p>A usage rate above 90 percent indicates chronic congestion — if you're unlucky enough to be in one of those cities, you might see a lot of video buffering, slow-loading websites, and slow online gaming. A lower usage rate indicates that there's plenty of spare capacity to handle traffic surges, providing customers with high performance at all times.</p> \n<p>You'll notice that Level 3's connections to LEC1 and LEC3 have gotten better over the last six months, while the connection to LEC 2 has gotten worse. Level 3 says that's not a coincidence: Netflix is one of Level 3's biggest customers, and LEC 1 and LEC 3 forced Netflix to pay them tolls to deliver content to their own customers — something that had previously been contrary to internet norms. So far, LEC 2 hasn't gotten paid, and it appears to be retaliating by letting its connections get congested.</p> \n<p>Level 3 won't say which broadband providers LEC 1 and LEC 3 are, but we know that Comcast and Verizon are two examples of broadband providers that forced Netflix to pay them to deliver traffic.</p> \n<p>The basic issue here is that customers are already paying ISPs to provide them with connectivity to the internet. When ISPs play hardball in interconnection disputes, they're essentially using their paying customers as hostages, degrading their internet experience to force content companies like Netflix to pay more. And because there's so little competition in the broadband market, there isn't much either customers or content providers can do about this.</p> \n<p>But ironically, the network neutrality regulations currently being considered by the FCC likely would not affect this kind of business tactic. Conventional network neutrality regulation treats negotiations between broadband ISPs and backbone providers such as Comcast as a separate market from the residential broadband market.</p> \n<p>But in practice, this distinction makes no sense. The hardball tactics big ISPs are using to get content companies to pay up have exactly the same effects on consumers and online competition as explicit fast lanes: the internet's level playing field is replaced by a market where some content gets better treatment than others.</p>",Television

Why the FCC will probably ignore the public on network neutrality,http://www.vox.com/2014/10/5/6905369/fcc-public-comment-broken,"An unprecedented number of people wrote it to protect the internet from overreaching ISPs, but the government will almost certainly ignore them.","<p><span>The flood of responses was ""unprecedented.""  Since the early 20</span><sup>th</sup><span> century, agencies like the Federal Communications Commission have asked the public for comments before making big decisions. But in the past few months, the Commission received a deluge for one particular proceeding that could change the Internet as we know it.</span></p> \n<p>The decision in question is on the fate of network neutrality - the idea that Internet Service Providers and the government should treat all data and traffic on the Internet the same.</p> \n<p><q class=""right"" aria-hidden=""true""><span>citizens largely failed to sway the three Republican commissioners who wanted to relax ownership rules</span></q></p> \n<p>The question is — will the FCC tally but otherwise ignore citizens' concerns? Or will it engage with the public and address those worries head on?</p> \n<p>If history is any indication, everyday citizens will likely continue to have weak influence at the agency. But understanding <i>why </i>citizens continue to have a weak influence points to a much larger tension between federal agencies and the public — and one that we must address if we want our agencies to help restore trust in government and strengthen their civic purpose.</p> \n<p>It's been more than a decade since the last major round of public participation in FCC rulemaking peaked but failed to win over the agency during a five-year debate over media ownership rules. (Note: rulemakings differ from complaints, like the hundreds of thousands of Janet Jackson/Superbowl complaints invoked incorrectly by commentators comparing them to participation in the Open Internet proceeding.) The rules, some of which had been in place since the 1940s, restricted how much a single company could own in local markets and the national market. The idea here was to reduce consolidation, and thus the control that big media magnates could wield over the airwaves and the American public. Then, in 2002, following a court decision that allowed more consolidation in the cable market, the Commission launched the most comprehensive review of ownership rules in the history of the agency to determine whether broadcast markets needed to keep apace with cable.</p> \n<p>During the ten months of the proceeding, and in a pre-social media era of email campaigns, citizens submitted more than half a million comments. Public interest organizations, like Free Press and Prometheus Radio Project, mobilized citizens to contribute comments to the rulemaking record. Together with Democratic Commissioners Michael Copps and Jonathan Adelstein, these groups organized nearly a dozen town hall meetings in which ordinary people could voice their concerns. Meanwhile, other groups like the National Rifle Association and MoveOn (strange bedfellows if there ever were any) galvanized their membership in separate letter-writing campaigns, generating a couple million postcards, letters, and emails to Commission staff opposing the rules.</p> \n<p>The impact?</p> \n<p>While public participation galvanized the public interest community and helped to turn Democrat Commissioners Adelstein and Copps into populist heroes, citizens largely failed to sway the three Republican commissioners who wanted to relax ownership rules. The Commission voted 3-2 to <i>increase</i> the number of television stations a single company could own, both locally and nationally; revised regulations governing common ownership of radio stations in local markets; and replaced two existing rules limiting common ownership (e.g., the newspaper/broadcast cross-ownership rule and the radio/television cross-ownership rule) with a single set of cross-media limits. The changes marked a radical re-rendering of the broadcast media marketplace, and paved the way for media conglomerates to expand their gatekeeping role when deciding which news to feature and which advertisements to carry, locally and nationally.</p> \n<p><q class=""center"" aria-hidden=""true""><span>""I find the whole rulemaking context almost hilarious in many instances, because you know you're reading something, and you know it's not true. And you're guessing, you know, the person is hallucinating.""</span></q></p> \n<p>The public interest community derided the vote and called the process a sham. Then, the debate moved out of the agency and into the courts, and citizen input began to look even more ineffectual. A year following the FCC's decision, an appellate court decision in the Third Circuit rejected parts of the Commission's suite of deregulatory changes and also asked it to revise other parts of its decision. Though Prometheus, the lead complainant on the case, as well as other public interest organizations, credited public participation as a motivating factor, the court made no reference to the hundreds of thousands of citizen comments asking the Commission to preserve or strengthen ownership rules.</p> \n<p>Four years later, and still in the glow of the appellate decision, this community mobilized again for a new proceeding on media ownership rules. Again, citizens flooded the Commission with comments, held town halls, and campaigned against media consolidation. The FCC also hosted a series of six public hearings.</p> \n<p>Yet, after more than 165,000 comments in the rulemaking record, and hundreds of hearing statements and testimonies, citizens once again had only a modest impact on the final decision. By and large, the vote solidified the Commission's trend towards deregulation: though some rules remained untouched, the agency relaxed rules regarding the ability of newspaper and broadcast companies to consolidate.</p> \n<p>So, what's the deal here? Why ask for public comment if only to give it short shrift?</p> \n<p>The answer lies partly in the tension between our <i>expectations</i> of how such rulemaking proceedings will function, and how, in reality, they're actually <i>designed</i> to function. In the interviews I conducted for my dissertation, FCC commissioners and a handful of staffers (e.g., civil servants, as opposed to political appointees) explained that the rulemaking process does not function like a popular democracy. In other words, you can't expect that the comment you submit opposing a particular regulation will function like a vote. Rulemaking is more akin to a court proceeding. Changes require systematic, reliable evidence, not emotional expressions. And with the exception of Democrat Commissioners Copps and Adelstein, the people I spoke with at the FCC considered citizen input during the media ownership proceeding as emotional and superficial content.</p> \n<p>One staffer explained why some comments in the record matter more than others, saying a lot of comments submitted by ordinary citizens are not ""usually very deep or analytical or, you know, substantiated by evidence, documentary or otherwise. They're usually expressions of opinion."" That means these kinds of comments are ""not usually reviewed at a very high level, because they didn't need to be.""</p> \n<p>Or as another staffer said, ""I find the whole rulemaking context almost hilarious in many instances, because you know you're reading something, and you know it's not true. And you're guessing, you know, the person is hallucinating."" Ordinary comments were, in other words, prone to error and lacked truthfulness, in the eyes of many of the Commission's staff. They also represented one person's opinion or experience, whereas according to staff, comments submitted by legal or economic experts collated information in a more systematic way, and from a much broader population of consumers.</p> \n<p>""There are limitations on the scope of the authority of the FCC to make certain changes in response to that public input,"" explained Commissioner Abernathy. The FCC, in other words, ought not to be swayed by popular opposition. ""We really do have to be careful, I think, about following the law that's given to you... [A rule] cannot be based on the number of complaints.""</p> \n<p>Commissioners Copps and Adelstein have argued that labeling the input of all ordinary citizens as worthless and emotional is misguided. They claimed that the stories people revealed in comments and in hearing testimony during the media ownership proceedings spoke to the failings of a consolidated media marketplace. And they added that ordinary Americans had few opportunities to share their experiences and opinions in a frank manner. News coverage about media ownership happened infrequently and rarely addressed a general readership.</p> \n<p>But Commissioners Copps and Adelstein were the exception. The other commissioners, like the career bureaucrats who spoke to me about the proceeding, viewed citizen stories as suspect, unverifiable, unsophisticated. And ultimately, that sentiment prevailed in the final rules voted upon by the Commission.</p> \n<p>There's one way to get the Commission to pay attention to comments: become a lawyer, economist or researcher and meet the Commission's expectations for what reasoned input really means.</p> \n<p>""Comments are going to be as good as the time and effort [commenters] put into it,"" one staffer explained to me.</p> \n<p>In the wake of more than 3 million comments in the present open Internet proceeding-<a href=""http://sunlightfoundation.com/blog/2014/09/02/what-can-we-learn-from-800000-public-comments-on-the-fccs-net-neutrality-plan/"">which at first blush appear overwhelmingly in favor of network neutrality</a>-the current Commission is poised to make history in two ways: its decision on net neutrality, and its acknowledgment of public perspectives. It can continue to shrink the comments of ordinary Americans to a summary count and thank-you for their participation. Or, it can opt for a different path.</p> \n<p><!--[if gte mso 9]><xml> 0   0   1   1550   8839   Vox Media    73   20   10369   14.0 </xml><![endif]--> <!--[if gte mso 9]><xml> Normal   0               false   false   false      EN-US   JA   X-NONE </xml><![endif]--><!--[if gte mso 9]><xml> </xml><![endif]--> <!--[if gte mso 10]> \n<style> \n /* Style Definitions */ \ntable.MsoNormalTable \n\t{mso-style-name:""Table Normal""; \n\tmso-tstyle-rowband-size:0; \n\tmso-tstyle-colband-size:0; \n\tmso-style-noshow:yes; \n\tmso-style-priority:99; \n\tmso-style-parent:""""; \n\tmso-padding-alt:0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt; \n\tmso-para-margin:0in; \n\tmso-para-margin-bottom:.0001pt; \n\tline-height:115%; \n\tmso-pagination:widow-orphan; \n\tfont-size:11.0pt; \n\tmso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt; \n\tfont-family:Arial; \n\tcolor:black;} \n</style> \n<![endif]--></p> \n<p>This doesn't mean it has to take all 3 million comments into consideration.

There's one huge problem with calls for anti-trust action against Amazon,http://www.vox.com/2014/10/10/6954107/amazon-monopoly,It's not a monopoly. It competes head to head with global giants like Walmart and Apple. It's not even profitable.,"<p>The New Republic has a dramatic cover story out this week by Frank Foer with the simple title ""<a href=""http://www.newrepublic.com/article/119769/amazons-monopoly-must-be-broken-radical-plan-tech-giant"">Amazon Must Be Stopped</a>."" The specific argument of the piece stretches together a few threads including a curious nostalgia for the traditional book publishing industry, a critique of the consumer-focused trend in post-1980 antitrust jurisprudence, and a swipe at Peter Thiel's techno-utopianism. But at its core is a very simple but fundamentally mistaken contention about Amazon, namely that ""the company has achieved a level of dominance that merits the application of a very old label: monopoly.""</p> \n<p>The simple fact of the matter, however, is that Amazon doesn't have any kind of monopoly.</p> \n<p>In the sale of physical objects it faces fierce competition from the likes of Walmart (whose market capitalization is still worth about $100 billion more than Amazon's), Target, Home Depot, Ikea, the Gap, and other major retail chains. In the sale of digital goods it faces fierce competition from Apple and Google. It is true that in some of these markets Amazon has a rather dominant market share. But having a lot of the market is not the same as having a monopoly. A monopoly needs to involve a lack of choice and some kind of barrier to entry. <span>Everyone gets their e-books from Amazon because they're just as cheap as Apple's e-books, but they work on a much broader range of devices. But if Amazon started offering an inferior e-book product to Apple's, then customers could and would switch.</span></p> \n<p>One important hint about Amazon's non-monopoly status can be found in its quarterly financial reports. That's where you find out about a company's profits. In its <a href=""file:///Users/matthewyglesias/Downloads/Q2%202014%20Financial%20Results.pdf"">most recent quarter</a>, for example, Amazon lost $126 million. Losing money is pretty typical for Amazon, which is not really a profitable company. If you'd like to know more about that, I <a href=""http://www.slate.com/articles/business/moneybox/2014/01/amazon_earnings_how_jeff_bezos_gets_investors_to_believe_in_him.single.html"">published 5,000 words on the subject in January</a>. But suffice it to say that ""low and often non-existent profits"" and ""monopoly"" are not really concepts that go together.</p> \n<p><span>Competitors hate Amazon because retail was an ultra-competitive low-margin game before Jeff Bezos ever came to town. To delve into this field and make it </span><i style=""line-height: 1.5;"">even more competitive</i><span> and </span><i style=""line-height: 1.5;"">even lower-margin</i><span> seems somewhere between unseemly and insane — but it's the reverse of a monopoly.</span></p> \n<p>The shame of it is that an excellent argument can be made that the shiny new world of high technology really could use a tougher stare from the anti-trust cops. T<span>he country has been suffering for years due to government-created monopolies known as software patents.

"The perfect response to people who say all Muslims are violent, in one tweet",http://www.vox.com/2014/10/13/6968999/bill-maher-islamophobia-muslims-violent-debunk,Show this to the next person who quotes Bill Maher on Islam to you.,"<p>Comedian and HBO talk show host Bill Maher sparked a major debate last week over Islam, arguing that the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) are actually not extremist outliers but represent the inherent violence and intolerance of Islam itself, and by extension its 1.6 billion followers. This is not actually a new debate (we've been having it on-and-off in America since September 2001), it's not just Maher making it, and, to be really clear about this, the arguments are both factually incorrect and deeply bigoted. <b>(READ: </b><a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/10/8/6918485/the-overt-islamophobia-on-american-tv-news-is-out-of-control"">It's not just Bill Maher. Islamophobia on cable news is out of control</a>.<b>)</b></p> \n<p>Still, Bill Maher is popular, and his ideas are unfortunately not uncommon, so you may find yourself facing some version of his argument in your daily life. There a number of ways you can respond: by pointing out Maher's factual errors, by noting that ISIS is widely loathed in Muslim-majority societies, and so on. <b>(READ: </b><a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/things-about-isis-you-need-to-know/what-is-isis"">Everything you need to know about ISIS</a><b>.)</b></p> \n<p>Or you could show them this one tweet, from Libyan-American Hend Amry, which skewers Maher-style Islamophobia concisely and just about perfectly. (The <a href=""https://twitter.com/TheMuslimGuy/status/520579013794742272"">meme</a> is originally by lawyer and commentator Arsalan Iftikhar.)</p> \n<blockquote class=""twitter-tweet"" lang=""en""> \n<p>5 of the last 12 Nobel Peace Prize winners were Muslim.

The fact that we are so ready to embrace that reasoning when it lets us promote deeply negative stereotypes about Muslims, including on major news outlets, is just another of many signs that Islamophobia is <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/10/8/6918485/the-overt-islamophobia-on-american-tv-news-is-out-of-control"">increasingly rampant in America</a>.</p> \n<p>So the next time someone asks you ""why are so many Muslims violent,"" before you launch into a detailed rebuttal debunking the misconceptions and errors behind the question, simply ask in response, ""Why are so many Muslims Nobel Peace Prize laureates?""</p>",Television
The Sopranos only ever made one bad episode and it was all Christopher Columbus's fault,http://www.vox.com/2014/10/13/6970539/christopher-columbus-sopranos-episode-imperioli,"""Christopher"" is the show's only legitimately bad episode. Not just worse than the rest â€” bad.","<p>It's the most trivial of offenses in light of <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/10/13/6957875/christopher-columbus-murderer-tyrant-scoundrel"">the rest of his rap sheet</a>, but the fact remains that Christopher Columbus led directly to the worst ever episode of <i>The Sopranos. </i><b>(Warning: the following contains extensive <i>Sopranos</i> spoilers, but really, it's been seven years since it ended. It's fine.)</b></p> \n<p>The plot of the episode — titled ""Christopher"" and written by Michael Imperioli, the actor who played Christopher Moltisanti on the show — is silly on just about every dimension. It's Columbus Day. There's going to be a parade. A Native American group is planning to protest the parade, because genocide. And for no apparent reason at all, Silvio Dante — who has previously demonstrated no interest in politics or history or really anything other than the operations of the Bada Bing — decides to devote substantial DiMeo crime family manpower to preventing the protest.</p> \n<p><q class=""center"" aria-hidden=""true"">The dialogue sounds like it was written by an eighth-grader assigned by his history teacher to write up Columbus's pros and cons</q></p> \n<p>It'd be one thing if the group happened upon the topic organically — if, say, Meadow Soprano had picked a fight with her father on the topic, and then he decided to make a big deal out of it. That'd make a modicum of sense. Meadow loves nothing more than showcasing her sophistication in front of her parents (see her fight with Carmela over whether there are gay themes in <i>Billy Budd</i>). But no. Silvio happens upon the issue because Bobby Bacala <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbbMIg-Aw8E"">read about it in the newspaper</a>. It's the flimsiest possible foundation to ground an episode upon.</p> \n<p>The whole opening scene (which, like the rest of the videos linked here, is sadly not embeddable but can be <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbbMIg-Aw8E"">seen here</a>) amounts to a clunky attempt to cram background on the Columbus controversy into dialogue. ""It's these Indians and the commie fucks,"" Ralphie Cifaretto, a sociopath with no previously demonstrated interest in current affairs, offers. ""They want to paint Columbus as a slave trader instead of an explorer."" It sounds like a more profane version of the ""Controversies"" subsection on Columbus's Wikipedia page, as dictated for an audiobook. It'd be one thing if the script played it for laughs, as an example of the team's willingness to opine at length on topics about which they're ignorant. But it doesn't. It's played completely straight. Silvio's position is even treated a little sympathetically.</p> \n<p>The show couldn't really explain why without breaking the fourth wall, but <i>The Sopranos</i> provoked a bit of a backlash among Italian-American groups for perpetuating Cosa Nostra-related stereotypes of Italians as a whole. The episode at times reads like an attempt by the writers to thumb their noses at the critics, but at others it appears to be apologizing to them by showing that yes, the Mafia is a tiny fraction of the overall Italian-American community. All the mob wives <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvVOnYu05Pc"">go to a talk</a> by a professor specializing in issues of Italian-American identity, hitting on these exact notes. ""For those who say Italian Americans eat smelly cheese and sip cold wine,"" she declares, referencing a stereotype I'm pretty sure isn't an actual thing, ""tell them we're from the land of aromatic Asiago and supple Barolo."" Sure?</p> \n<center> \n<p><img src=""http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2351088/Screenshot_2014-10-13_15.41.31.0.png"" alt=""christopher ralphie columbus soprano"" data-chorus-asset-id=""2351088""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">The protesters assemble. (HBO)</p> \n</center> \n<p>Similarly, what Native Americans are portrayed in the episode are shown to be either fanatics (the protestors), or else corrupt and willing to sell out their heritage for cash (the chief to whom Tony reaches out in an attempt to stop the protest). Even though David Chase and the staff clearly agree that Columbus Day is unseemly, they for whatever reason decide to put that case in the mouths of wholly unsympathetic characters. ""Mussolini was Hitler's bitch!"" <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSlX36QP_po"">one protestor yells</a>, as if that has anything to do with anything.</p> \n<p>The Soprano who turns on Columbus isn't Meadow, but AJ (AJ?), who's <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O4xIjWgBEMU"">depicted unthinkingly regurgitating</a> Howard Zinn's <i>A People's History of the United States. </i>""It's the truth, it's in my history book!"" he declares, because he's AJ, and AJ is very dumb. Ultimately, the episode seems to come down on Tony's side: Yes, Columbus was a hero, but <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pb7BIaaxGAU"">Silvio's focus on Italian heritage is myopic</a>, and at some point you have to move on.</p> \n<p>But the worst part isn't even that the politics of the episode are inconsistent and often wrongheaded. It's that the dialogue sounds like it was written by an eighth-grader assigned by his history teacher to write up Columbus's pros and cons. It's basic to the point of insulting, lacks any of the wit or verisimilitude of the show's writing at its best, and doesn't reflect anything about the characters assigned to speak it. It's hard to believe it comes in the same season as ""Whitecaps,"" which featured perhaps the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IV-D5SvQnF0"">best-written marital fight in the history of television</a>.</p> \n<p>The other plots in the episode mostly amount to place-setting for the rest of the fourth season, and are rushed through to make room for sophomoric exchanges about Columbus. Ralphie dumps Rosalie Aprile, and is dumped by Janice Soprano in turn. Bobby's wife dies, setting up his marriage to Janice, a huge part of later seasons. Pie-O-My, Ralphie's horse who Tony came to love more than any human living or dead, is introduced for the first time. Johnnie Sack learns that Ralphie mocked Sack's wife for her weight, prompting a significant rift between the New York and New Jersey crime families. These are all interesting, important plot developments that easily could have consumed the whole episode — and should have. But for some reason they got mashed up with a middle school term paper about Italian-American identity instead.</p> \n<center> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""2351090"" alt=""michael ralphie sopranos columbus"" src=""http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2351090/Screenshot_2014-10-13_15.43.04.0.png""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Michael Imperioli: great as Christopher Moltisanti, horrible on Christopher Columbus.

The right wasn't always opposed to regulations protecting online innovation,http://www.vox.com/2014/10/22/6979937/conservatives-deregulation-and-telecom-monopolies,Republicans used to favor regulating telecom monopolies to protect online innovation.,"<p><span>To understand today's net neutrality debate, its important to understand the history of how of the government has regulated the telecom industry. Beginning in the 1970s, the federal government deregulated the industry, paving the way for the modern internet. But when people talked about deregulation back in the 1970s, they meant something different from the concept liberals hate — and conservatives love — today.</span></p> \n<p>This history has important implications for the modern network neutrality debate. Today, most conservatives portray any regulation of incumbent phone and cable companies as an assault on the free market. But a previous generation of right-leaning policymakers had a different view. They understood that the free market can't work without competition, and that competition sometimes requires active support from the government.</p> \n<h3>""Deregulating"" communications involved a lot of regulation</h3> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""2377244"" alt=""454796520_6a79ca1141_b.0.jpg"" src=""http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2377244/454796520_6a79ca1141_b.0.jpg""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Many early internet users connected using a modem that looked something like this.

During this period, regulators opened a number of industries — long distance calling, telephony devices like answering machines and modems, and online services — up to competition from third parties.</p> \n<p>In part, that meant repealing regulations that had made it effectively illegal for anyone other than AT&amp;T to offer these services, which is why the policy is usually referred to as deregulation. But that wasn't all the feds did. They also took action to ensure that AT&amp;T — and, later, the seven regional monopolies, dubbed Baby Bells, created by AT&amp;T's breakup — didn't abuse their monopoly power.</p> \n<p><span>The breakup itself is the most obvious example. The Justice Department filed an antitrust lawsuit in 1974 that led to the company's breakup a decade later.</span></p> \n<p>At the same time, the FCC was working on <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FCC_Computer_Inquiries#Computer_II"">regulations</a> designed to shield the fledgling computer networking industry from anti-competitive behaviors by AT&amp;T. While the term network neutrality hadn't yet been coined, the basic idea was similar. Under regulations developed in the 1970s, AT&amp;T wasn't allowed to discriminate among companies that leased its facilities in order to provide online services.</p> \n<p>This policy became particularly important in the 1990s, when customers went online by connecting modems to old-fashioned telephone lines. Some incumbent phone companies argued that it was abusive for dial-up ISPs to use their phone lines so much, and they wanted to charge ISPs per-minute usage fees. But <a href=""http://books.google.com/books?id=fzGTQ8VcATMC&amp;pg=PA492&amp;lpg=PA492&amp;dq=%22we+also+are+not+convinced+that+the+nonassessment+of+access+charges+results%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=fxFGUC8JPF&amp;sig=TwfxSkvDodojZjyc7r_iRS439-g&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=dItFVJu8DY_bsATo4oHABg&amp;ved=0CCAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22we%20also%20are%20not%20convinced%20that%20the%20nonassessment%20of%20access%20charges%20results%22&amp;f=false"">the FCC refused</a>, forcing incumbent telephone companies to continue leasing phone lines to dial-up ISPs for the same flat monthly rates it charges to other business customers. That decision helped to make the internet widely available and affordable in the late 1990s.</p> \n<p>The dial-up internet depended on the FCC in another way too: agency regulations in the late 1960s and 1970s forced AT&amp;T to allow third-party devices such as modems to operate on its network. Without FCC action, AT&amp;T might have strangled the market for modems in its cradle, setting the online economy back by years.</p> \n<h3>Pro-competitive regulations once enjoyed bipartisan support</h3> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""2377248"" alt=""51655945.0.jpg"" src=""http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2377248/51655945.0.jpg""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">President Bill Clinton and House Speaker Newt Gingrich in 1998.

RICHARDS/AFP/Getty Images)</p> \n<p>Today these might be classified as left-wing policies, but they weren't seen that way at the time.</p> \n<p>The antitrust lawsuit against AT&amp;T was begun under Republican Gerald Ford, continued under Democrat Jimmy Carter, and completed under Republican Ronald Reagan. The forerunner of modern neutrality regulations, known as the <i>Computer Inquiries</i>, were developed over the course of two decades by Democratic and Republican administrations.</p> \n<p>And this consensus endured in the 1990s. The 1996 Telecommunications Act, crafted by the conservative Congress of Newt Gingrich, continued the basic approach of the <i>Computer Inquiries</i>. It regulated the Baby Bells as common carriers, requiring them to lease their networks to competitors at regulated rates. Few people saw these regulations as an attack on the free market; to the contrary, they were seen as an essential precondition to a healthy, competitive market.</p> \n<h3>Why the consensus broke down</h3> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""2377278"" alt=""454251122.0.jpg"" src=""http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2377278/454251122.0.jpg""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">(Spencer Platt/Getty Images)</p> \n<p>In the late 1990s, cable companies began offering high-speed internet access over cable lines. That created a quandary for the FCC. In previous decades, pro-competitive internet regulations had focused on telephone companies. The FCC had to decide whether those same rules should apply to cable internet service.</p> \n<p>At the time, there was a lot of optimism that these cable modem services were the first step toward a much more competitive broadband market. People predicted that other new technologies, such as broadband over power lines, high-speed wireless internet, and new fiber optic networks, would introduce additional competitors into the broadband market. The optimists hoped that a much more competitive market for broadband service would make regulation of incumbent telephone companies unnecessary.</p> \n<p>Under George W. Bush, this view became the conventional wisdom on the political right. The Bush FCC largely abandoned the pro-competitive regulations that had been developed under previous administrations, arguing that these regulations were holding back investment in broadband networks. They hoped that eliminating regulation would encourage existing companies to invest in faster networks and also encourage new companies to enter the market.</p> \n<p>A decade later, these policies aren't working so well. Most American consumers still have two or fewer options for home broadband access. And for many customers (including me) the local phone company only offers ancient DSL service, making cable internet the only realistic option. The vigorous competition we were promised hasn't really materialized.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, the largest broadband providers have begun abusing their market power in exactly the way AT&amp;T's critics feared decades ago. At least two broadband providers have <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/5/2/5665890/beyond-net-neutrality-the-new-battle-for-the-future-of-the-internet"">threatened</a> to degrade  customers' Netflix streaming experience if Netflix doesn't pay a toll to reach their customers. That's particularly alarming because Netflix competes directly with cable companies' own paid TV service.</p> \n<p>A key insight of the 1970s was that deregulation works best when the market is competitive — and that when competition is lacking, regulation is needed to promote competition and prevent monopoly power from being abused. Unfortunately, that lesson has largely been forgotten on the political right, which increasingly sees any efforts to safeguard the open, competitive internet as a threat to the free market.</p>",Television
Amazon is doing the world a favor by crushing book publishers,http://www.vox.com/2014/10/22/7016827/amazon-hachette-monopoly,The industry is right that Jeff Bezos is destroying them. But he's not doing it by abusing monopoly power. They're weak because they're not doing anything useful. People who care about literature and ideas will be better off without them.,"<p>News broke Thursday morning that <a href=""http://theverge.com/e/6978744"" target=""_blank"">Amazon</a> has settled its <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/5/24/5746868/9-questions-about-amazon-and-hachette-you-were-embarassed-to-ask"" target=""_blank"">long-running dispute with the book publisher Hachette</a>. This brings months of sniping to an end, but the structural conflict between publishers and the retail giant isn't going away. And here's a little real talk about the book publishing industry — it adds almost no value, it is going to be wiped off the face of the earth soon, and writers and readers will be better off for it.</p> \n<p>The fundamental uselessness of book publishers is why I thought it was dumb of the Department of Justice to even bother prosecuting them for their <a href=""http://www.slate.com/articles/business/moneybox/2012/03/doj_vs_book_publishers_who_cares_if_apple_and_publishers_are_colluding_to_raise_e_book_prices_.html"">flagrantly illegal cartel behavior</a> a couple of years back, and it's why I'm deaf to the argument that <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/5/24/5746868/9-questions-about-amazon-and-hachette-you-were-embarassed-to-ask"">Amazon's ongoing efforts to crush Hachette</a> are evidence of a public policy problem that needs remedy. Franklin Foer's recent efforts to label Amazon a monopolist are <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/10/10/6954107/amazon-monopoly"">unconvincing</a>, and Paul Krugman's narrower argument that they have <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/20/opinion/paul-krugman-amazons-monopsony-is-not-ok.html"">some form of monopsony power in the book industry</a> is equally wrongheaded.</p> \n<p>What is indisputably true is that Amazon is on track to destroy the businesses of incumbent book publishers. But the many authors and intellectuals who've been convinced that their interests — or the interests of literary culture writ large — are identical with those of the publishers are simply mistaken.</p> \n<h3>Books are published by giant conglomerates</h3> \n<div class=""align-right""> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""2379892"" alt=""220px-Les_Moonves_at_the_2009_Tribeca_Film_Festival.0.jpg"" src=""http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2379892/220px-Les_Moonves_at_the_2009_Tribeca_Film_Festival.0.jpg""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">The CEO of Simon &amp; Schuster's parent company earned $67 million in 2013 (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leslie_Moonves#mediaviewer/File:Les_Moonves_at_the_2009_Tribeca_Film_Festival.jpg"">David Shankbone</a>)</p> \n</div> \n<p>Wisdom on this subject begins with the observation that the book publishing industry is not a cuddly craft affair. It's dominated by a Big Four of publishers, who are themselves subsidiaries of much larger conglomerates. Simon &amp; Schuster is owned by CBS, HarperCollins is owned by NewsCorp, Penguin and RandomHouse are jointly owned by Pearson and Bertelsmann, and Hachette is part of an enormous French company called Lagadère.</p> \n<p>These are not tiny, helpless enterprises. Were their owners interested in the future of books and publishing, they could invest the money necessary to make their own e-reading apps and e-book store and render Amazon entirely superfluous. But the managers of these conglomerates don't really care. If they can get famous authors to lobby the government to stop Amazon from killing them for free, then they're happy to take the free labor.</p> \n<p><span>But they don't want to invest actual money and energy in competing with Amazon, they'd rather wring whatever remaining profit there is out of book publishing and dedicate the money to dividends or other industries they're also involved in.</span></p> \n<h3>Amazon faces lots of competition</h3> \n<p>It is undeniably true that Amazon has a very large share of the market for e-books. What is not true is that Amazon faces a lack of competition in the digital book market. Barnes &amp; Noble — a company that knows something about books — sells e-books, and does so in partnership with a small outfit called Microsoft. Apple sells e-books and so does Google.</p> \n<p>These are not obscure companies. It is not inconvenient for customers to access their products. And since these are companies that are actually much bigger and more profitable than Amazon, there is absolutely no way Jeff Bezos can drive them out of business with predatory pricing.</p> \n<p>Amazon's e-book product is much more popular than its rivals because Amazon got there first, and the competition has not succeeded in producing anything better. But consumers who prefer to buy a digital book from a non-Amazon outlet have several easy options available, and thus a book publisher who chooses to eschew Amazon will not actually be unable to reach customers.</p> \n<h3>Publishers are superfluous</h3> \n<p>In the traditional book purchasing paradigm, when a reader bought a book at the store there were two separate layers of middlemen taking a cut of the cash before money reached the author: a retailer and a publisher. The publisher, in this paradigm, was doing very real work as part of the value-chain. A typed and printed book manuscript looks nothing like a book. Transforming the manuscript into a book and then arranging for it to be shipped in appropriate quantities to physical stores around the country is a non-trivial task. What's more, neither bookstore owners nor authors have any expertise in this field.</p> \n<p>Digital publishing is not like that. Transforming a writer's words into a readable e-book product can be done with a combination of software and a minimal amount of training. Book publishers do not have any substantial expertise in software development, but Amazon and its key competitors (Apple, Google, and the B&amp;N/Microsoft partnership) do.</p> \n<p>Publishers would like writers to believe that the pressure they are feeling from Amazon will trickle down and hurt authors as well. But there is a big difference. Even in the brave new world of e-publishing, authors are still making a crucial contribution to the industry by writing the books. Publishers are getting squeezed out because they don't contribute anything of value.</p> \n<h3>Book publishers are terrible at marketing</h3> \n<p><img src=""http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2379852/shutterstock_148044401.0.jpg"" alt=""shutterstock_148044401.0.jpg"" data-chorus-asset-id=""2379852""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Who will get you to read these things? (Shutterstock)</p> \n<p>When I was a kid, my father was a novelist as were both of my grandparents. So I heard a lot of stories about how useless publishers are at marketing books. Then I got to know other people who wrote books and they had the same complaints. Then I wrote a book, and their complaints became my complaints. But it's easy to whine that other people aren't marketing your product effectively. It took the Amazon/Hachette dispute to conclusively prove that the whiners are correct.</p> \n<p>After all, imagine a world in which publishers <i>were</i> good at marketing books. Then it would be almost trivial for Hachette to get what it wants out of Amazon. It could just not sell its books on Amazon! Unlike in the old days when it might have been inconvenient for someone who lived in a town with a Borders but no Barnes &amp; Noble to go get a book that Borders didn't sell, it's trivially easy to click on some non-Amazon website to order a book. But you do need a customer who actually wants to buy the book.</p> \n<p>In his column, Krugman compares Amazon's large market share to Standard Oil's. But books aren't undifferentiated commodities the way oil is. If you want to buy <i>Paul Krugman's new book</i>, then you can't just substitute some other book. Hachette, however, seems (appropriately) to have almost no confidence in its own ability to market books.</p> \n<p>The real risk for publishers is that major authors might discover that they <i>do</i> have the ability to market books. When George RR Martin's next iteration of the Game of Thrones series is released, I will buy it. If I can buy it as an Amazon Kindle book, I will buy it that way. If he decides that the only way people should be able to read the book is to get <a href=""http://www.powells.com/biblio/74-9780553582024-0"">Powell's to mail them a copy</a>, then I will buy it that way. And I am not alone. Nor is Martin the only author with the clout to not worry about the terms of distribution.</p> \n<p>But for a publisher to team up with a celebrity author in this way to bypass Amazon would merely reveal how easy it would be for a celebrity author to bypass the incumbent publishers. In the old days, even the most famous author would need a publishing partner to actually make the physical books. Today that's not the case. Martin needs a software platform to sell books, but publishers don't have one. He could easily hire one or more editors to work with him on the copy if he wants to.</p> \n<h3>Advances aren't charitable contributions</h3> \n<p>The final role of the modern book publisher is as a payer of advances. The way the money end of books work is that the person who wrote a book gets paid a royalty on each copy sold — a sum that is generally much less than half the retail price of the book, and dramatically lower than the 70%<a href=""https://kdp.amazon.com/help?topicId=A30F3VI2TH1FR8#2-2_titles""> that Amazon is willing to pay</a> to authors who bypass the publishing incumbents. In addition to royalties, a publisher will typically pay you an <i>advance. </i>The advance is a special kind of loan. When your book first starts selling copies, the royalties you would be owed are kept by the publisher to repay the advance. If you sell a lot of books, you'll fully repay your advance and start seeing money. If you sell very few books, you'll never repay your advance and are under no obligation to do so.</p> \n<p>To Foer, ultimately, the case against Amazon comes down to advances, which he sees as ""the economic pillar on which quality books rest, the great bulwark against dilettantism."" At the same time, he believes that ""no bank or investor in its right mind would extend that kind of credit to an author, save perhaps Stephen King."" Thus ""it won't take much for this anomalous ecosystem to collapse"" if publishers are pushed too hard by Amazon.</p> \n<p>My best guess is that this is too pessimistic about the financial logic behind giving advances. It is not, after all, just a loan that you may or may not pay back. An advance is bundled with a royalty agreement in which a majority of the sales revenue is allocated to someone <i>other</i> than the author of the book. In its role as venture capitalist, the publisher is effectively issuing what's called convertible debt in corporate finance circles — a risky loan that becomes an ownership stake in the project if it succeeds.</p> \n<p>But what really matters here is that book publishers are not charities. They are for-profit business enterprises. If advances don't make financial sense, then they will die off regardless of what happens to Amazon. If they do make financial sense, then they will live on as financial products even as the rest of the industry restructures.</p> \n<h3>A bounty of affordable reading</h3> \n<p><img src=""http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2379868/shutterstock_133717904.0.jpg"" alt=""shutterstock_133717904.0.jpg"" data-chorus-asset-id=""2379868""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">It's fundamental (Shutterstock)</p> \n<p><span>When all is said and done, the argument between Amazon and book publishers is over the rather banal question of price. Amazon's view is that since ""printing"" an extra copy of an e-book is really cheap, e-books should be really cheap. Publishers' view is that since ""printing"" an extra copy of an e-book is really cheap, e-books should offer enormous profit margins to book publishers. If you care about reading or ideas or literature, the choice between these visions is not a difficult one. The publishing incumbents have managed to get some intellectuals sufficiently tangled-up to believe that it is. But ask yourself this — do you regret the invention of the printing press? Of the paperback? Do you think public libraries devalue books and reading? The idea is absurd.</span></p> \n<p><i>Of course</i> a world where more people can get more books more conveniently is a better world. It is true that some individual authors may earn less in the new era, while others authors may earn more. But there is no reason to believe that authors as a whole will get less money. Indeed, as Amazon and other digital distributors gobble up some of the publishers' slice of the revenue, it's likely that authors will also get a share and see their total income rise. Beyond money, no book worth writing is undertaken for purely pecuniary motives. In the new regime it will be easier for writers to find readers and reach larger audiences. <span>They just won't find them through the exact same set of middlemen who currently sit astride the pipeline. Tough on them.</span></p>",Television

(She also drew heat for reporting a link between <a href=""http://www.mediaite.com/tv/attkisson-defends-reports-on-vaccine-autism-link-many-peer-reviewed-studies-show-it/"" target=""_blank"">vaccines and autism</a>, an idea that has been widely debunked.)</p> \n<p><q class=""right"" aria-hidden=""true"">""The way to do it wouldn't be to hold down the delete key""</q></p> \n<p>On Tuesday, Attkisson will publish her book, <i>Stonewalled: My Fight for Truth Against the Forces of Obstruction, Intimidation, and Harassment in Obama's Washington</i>.

It turns out that not only does this bear none of the hallmarks of anything remotely resembling hacking but, based on all available evidence, it looks like what actually happened is probably that her delete key got stuck.</span></p> \n<p>Let's look at what Attkisson claims. <span>There are a number of incidents, all of which seem like perfectly anodyne technology glitches. The book opens with her computer's hard drive making a whining sound (""Reeeeeeeeeee"" is the very first word). Attkisson breathlessly recounts how her digital TV would ""spontaneously jitter, mute, and freeze-frame."" She finds a stray cable dangling out of the Verizon box on the back of her house, something that would in fact be necessary for hacking had the Internet never been invented.</span></p> \n<h3>The key hacking incident, which Attkisson very strongly suggests was political retribution</h3> \n<p>But the incident that's being portrayed as the <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/wp/2014/10/31/sharyl-attkisson-releases-video-of-alleged-computer-intrusion/"" target=""_blank"">real slam-duck evidence</a> is this scene, in which text is mysteriously deleted on her screen as she's writing. The scene comes just after she's learned that White House officials Jay Carney and Eric Schultz had complained to the White House about her Benghazi reporting:</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>That very night, with Schultz, Carney, and company freshly steaming over my Benghazi reporting, I'm home doing final research and crafting questions for the next day's interview with [Thomas] Pickering. Suddenly data in my computer file begins wiping at hyperspeed before my eyes. Deleted line by line in a split second: it's gone, gone, gone. I press the mouse pad and keyboard to try to stop it, but I have no control. The only time I've seen anything like this is in those movies where the protagonist desperately tries to copy crucial files faster than the antagonist can remotely wipe them.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>What a coincidence: just hours after the White House is ""fuming"" over her hard-hitting reporting, her computer is attacked. In another scene, she meets with an anonymous ""government source"" she calls Number One — the book seems to often turn on strange meetings with unnamed sources who may or may not be actual experts — who all but confirms that it was hacked by the US government in an act of intimidation.</p> \n<p>Attkisson was hacked, Number One says, by a ""sophisticated entity that used commercial, nonattributable spyware that's proprietary to a government agency: either the CIA, FBI, the Defense Intelligence Agency, or the National Security Agency."" Number One adds, <span>""This is outrageous. Worse than anything Nixon ever did.

Exit polls: how they work and whether to trust them,http://www.vox.com/2014/11/4/7150019/exit-polls-2014-midterm-election-results-biased,And why anyone saying they have a LEAKED EXIT POLL is lying to you.,"<p>The frustrating thing about Election Day is that no one actually has any information about how it's going until Election Night or later. But thanks to exit polls — conducted immediately after a sample of voters cast their ballots — we can get an early (but not too early) idea of how a race has shaken out before all the votes are counted.</p> \n<p>But why do news outlets take so long to release exit poll data? And is it really that reliable? Here's what you need to know about the poll that will shape the way we understand the 2014 <a style=""font-size: 15.5555562973022px; line-height: 1.5;"" href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/11/3/7150951/midterm-election-2014-live-updates-results-polls-predictions-2014"" target=""_blank"">midterm elections.</a></p> \n<h3>How do exit polls work?</h3> \n<p>Every November election, exit polls are conducted by a group of media outlets called the National Election Pool: NBC, CBS, ABC, Fox, CNN, and the Associated Press. They hire a pollster to conduct the exit poll, but they're the ones who own the information — and who get to be the first to report the results.</p> \n<p><img src=""http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2424980/81007956.0.jpg"" alt=""hillary election party 2008 sad"" data-chorus-asset-id=""2424980""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Exit polls can really ruin the mood at an election-night party. (Joe Raedle/Getty)</p> \n<p>The actual polling is conducted by an army of thousands of interviewers who get sent to hundreds of polling places around the country. Interviewers approach a certain number of voters who are leaving the polling place — <span>the exact fraction surveyed is secret</span><span> — and ask them to fill out the written exit poll survey.</span></p> \n<p><span>As early voting has become more popular, it's gotten harder to predict vote totals just by talking to people who vote on Election Day. So in 2008, exit pollsters started conducting pre-election phone polls to ask people if they'd already voted, so they could factor early voters into their projections. </span></p> \n<h3>What can you learn from exit polls?</h3> \n<p>The primary purpose of the exit poll is to allow TV networks and the AP to project who's won races as soon after the polls close as possible. But that's not the only question that the exit poll asks.</p> \n<p>Voters are asked to provide basic demographic information like gender, age and ethnicity. Furthermore, they're asked some questions about their personal viewpoints and behaviors — like their religion and churchgoing habits — and questions about major issues facing the country.</p> \n<p>That means that the exit poll data is actually more detailed, in some ways, than the official US Census vote tallies that come out several weeks after the election. It can offer the first hints — and often the most important ones — to what voters thought this election was about. That's very important to pundits as they try to interpret what it means.</p> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""2425028"" alt=""Candy Crowley debate"" src=""http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2425028/154244368.0.jpg""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">CNN's Candy Crowley has to do some high-speed exit-poll interpretation on Election Night.

Bush. That narrative came out of the exit poll data.</p> \n<p>Of course, what voters say is important to them is partly what campaigns have told voters is important — there's political science research <a href=""https://etd.ohiolink.edu/!etd.send_file?accession=osu1217332406&amp;disposition=inline"" target=""_blank"">suggesting</a> that when a campaign hammers particular issues, those are the issues that the candidate's supporters say are most important to them. But the exit poll is still the best opportunity the national media has, in some ways, to figure out who voted, why, and how.</p> \n<h3><span>When does the public get to find out about exit poll results?</span></h3> \n<p><span>The media outlets running the exit poll want to be able to </span><span>describe</span><i style=""font-size: 15.5555562973022px; line-height: 1.5;""> </i><span>who's voting, and who they're voting for, to the public as early as possible.

In the US, it's not illegal, but there's a binding agreement among the media outlets that run the exit poll that none of them is allowed to leak any results before the polls have closed. Since the participating organizations don't want to be locked out of future exit polls, they have every reason not to break that agreement.</p> \n<p><img src=""http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2424988/110121651.0.jpg"" alt=""Top Secret"" data-chorus-asset-id=""2424988""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Archival footage of the 1944 exit poll.

And there's a strictly regimented schedule for when exit poll results can get released.</p> \n<p>Around 5 pm ET, media outlets are allowed to start reporting what the exit poll says about <i>who </i>turned out to vote — the racial, age, or party breakdown of voters. But these are preliminary results, and they're going to be skewed toward people who voted early in the day. So groups who tend to vote later in the day — like young voters — might be underrepresented in the stats that first get announced.</p> \n<p><a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.vox.com/xpress/2014/11/4/7152639/poll-closing-times-voting-ends/in/6914992"" style=""font-size: 15.5555562973022px; line-height: 1.5;"">As soon as polls close in a particular state,</a> media outlets are allowed to project who's going to win elections there, based on the exit poll results. In deep-blue or deep-red states, where the outcome of the election isn't really in doubt, media outlets don't waste any time projecting winners. So the minute that 7 pm hits on the East Coast, for example, you can expect to see CNN and the AP make a bunch of projections at once. In states with closer races, media outlets will often wait to get the final exit poll results (including people who voted right before the polls closed), or wait to see how actual vote tallies stack up when precincts start reporting official vote totals.</p> \n<h3>Don't exit poll results ever get leaked?</h3> \n<p>There has never been an actual leaked exit poll in the US. But there have been plenty of hoaxes.</p> \n<p><span>If you see anyone on Facebook sharing ""LEAKED EXIT POLL RESULTS"" while the polls are still open, be very, very skeptical. And definitely don't decide not to vote just because you saw something in a leaked exit poll. </span></p> \n<h3><span>Are exit polls always right?</span></h3> \n<p>No. In fact, there are some particular challenges that exit polls have faced for the last several elections, that they still haven't found a way to work out:</p> \n<p><b>Early voters. </b>The phone poll for early voters is a new addition to the exit poll, and it's not clear that the kinks have been worked out yet. It runs into the problems any phone poll has — namely, that it's difficult to poll people who only have mobile phones. Furthermore, the exit pollsters don't typically do early-vote polling in every state; in 2012, only 15 states got early-vote polling.</p> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""2425030"" alt=""Early voters"" src=""http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2425030/458343956.0.jpg""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">No exit poll interviewer here. (Justin Sullivan/Getty)</p> \n<p><b>Small groups. </b>Like any poll, the smaller a sample size is, the less likely it is to be representative. So the exit poll is pretty reliable when it comes to large demographics (men, women, Democrats, Republicans) but gets less reliable when it gets to small demographics (young voters, Jewish voters).</p> \n<p><b>Voters of color. </b>In addition to the general problems with smaller voting demographics, <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.latinodecisions.com/blog/2010/11/04/how-the-national-exit-poll-badly-missed-the-latino-vote-in-2010/"">analysts believe</a> that the exit poll has a tendency to oversample a particular kind of voter of color — the kind who lives in majority-white areas.</p> \n<p>Here's the logic. Even though the public doesn't know exactly how the exit poll chooses where to go, it's possible to make some educated guesses. The exit poll is trying to predict the margin of victory for one candidate over another across the state. So when it decides which polling places to put interviewers outside of, it's reasonable to assume that it's choosing lots of swing precincts — precincts that are harder to predict and likely to affect the outcome. Those are going to be largely white precincts.</p> \n<p>Alternatively, says Matt Barreto of Latino Decisions, exit pollsters might choose a precinct as a benchmark based on the last cycle. For example, if a precinct voted for the Democratic Senator 70 percent to 30 percent in 2008, the pollster might choose to put an exit-poll interviewer at that precinct to see if the Democrat's getting less than 70 percent of the vote this time around. But they're not necessarily paying attention to the racial makeup of those precincts.</p> \n<p>Here's why this is a problem: the voters of color pollsters run into in majority-white precincts might not be representative of the voters of color across the state. In particular, according to<a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.latinodecisions.com/blog/2010/11/04/how-the-national-exit-poll-badly-missed-the-latino-vote-in-2010/""> Latino Decisions,</a> voters of color living among whites are ""more assimilated, better educated, higher income, and more conservative than other minority voters.""</p> \n<p>Check out the difference between the percent of nonwhite voters who had a college degree in 2010, according to the US Census vs. the exit poll:</p> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""2424660"" alt=""Education level nonwhite voters exit polls"" src=""http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2424660/Screen_Shot_2014-11-03_at_4.32.31_PM.0.png""></p> \n<p>And the problem's even worse for Latino voters, because exit polls are almost never offered in Spanish — even though over a quarter of Latino voters prefer Spanish to English. So the exit polls oversample English-speaking Latinos.</p> \n<p>All of these issues together mean that the exit polls sometimes think that Latino voters are much more favorable to Republicans than they actually are. In 2010, for example, Harry Reid won reelection to the Senate by turning out Latinos to vote against his Republican challenger, Sharron Angle, who was running as a hardcore immigration hawk. But according to the exit polls, 30<a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.latinodecisions.com/blog/2010/11/04/how-the-national-exit-poll-badly-missed-the-latino-vote-in-2010/""> percent of Nevada Latinos voted for Angle</a> — many more than voted for John McCain for president in 2008.

As a matter of fact, even with the issues listed above, exit polls have historically been biased toward Democrats more often than they've been biased toward Republicans.</p> \n<p>In 2004, for example, the exit polls <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.latinodecisions.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/2004_evaluation.pdf"">overestimated John Kerry's share of the vote</a> (by ""more than one standard error"") in 26 states; it overestimated George W. Bush's share in only 4 states. The reason for the error? Bush voters were more likely than Kerry voters to refuse to answer a pollster's questions after they left the voting booth.</p> \n<h3>How often do exit polls get the outcome wrong<span>?</span>\n</h3> \n<p>Honestly, not that often. The errors in exit polls aren't enough to get the outcome of the race wrong — they just might misstate how much the victor won by, or who supported him/her the most.</p> \n<p>So if the polls close on Election Day, and CNN immediately projects that your preferred candidate for Senate is going to lose the election, don't hold your breath for an eventual victory.

9 questions about network neutrality you were too embarrassed to ask,http://www.vox.com/2014/11/10/7187281/9-questions-about-network-neutrality-you-were-too-embarrassed-to-ask,The FCC is expected to approve network neutrality regulations on Thursday. Here's what that means.,"<p><span>On Thursday, the Federal Communications Commission is expected to approve the strongest network-</span><span>neutrality </span><span>rules</span><span> yet. The </span><span>regulations</span><span> are</span><span> designed to create a level playing field online by prohibiting broadband providers from giving some online content favored treatment over others. Otherwise, advocates say, websites that don't pay up could get slowed to a crawl. </span><span>The </span><span>rules</span><span> will apply to both residential broadband service and the wireless </span><span>networks that run</span><span> your smartphone.</span></p> \n<p>If you're just tuning in now, it can seem a little overwhelming. What is network neutrality? What's ""reclassification?"" And why have people been arguing so angrily for so long? Here's an explanation that starts from the very beginning.</p> \n<h3>1) What is network neutrality?</h3> \n<p><img src=""http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2445320/132600846.0.jpg"" alt=""132600846.0.jpg"" data-chorus-asset-id=""2445320""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Facebook founders Mark Zuckerberg and Dustin Moscovitz in 2004. (Justine Hunt/The Boston Globe via Getty Images)</p> \n<p>When Mark Zuckerberg created Facebook in his Harvard dorm room, he didn’t need to ask Comcast, Verizon, or other internet service providers (ISPs) to add Facebook to their networks. He also didn’t have to pay those companies extra fees to ensure that Facebook would work as well as the websites of established companies. Instead, as soon as he created the Facebook website, it was automatically available from any internet-connected computer in the world.</p> \n<p>That’s <span>network neutrality. </span>It's the idea that these companies should treat all internet traffic equally. It says your ISP shouldn’t be allowed to block or degrade access to certain websites or services, nor should it be allowed to set aside a ""fast lane"" that allows content favored by the ISP to load more quickly than the rest.</p> \n<h3>2) What’s the argument for network neutrality?</h3> \n<p>Advocates say the neutrality of the internet is a big reason there has been so much online innovation over the last two decades. Network neutrality keeps the barriers to entry for new websites and internet applications low. That freedom has allowed the creation of dozens of innovative online services, such as Google, Twitter, Netflix, <a href=""http://amazon.com/"">Amazon.com</a>, Skype, and more.</p> \n<p><q class=""right"" aria-hidden=""true""><span>Advocates say the neutrality of the internet is a big reason there has been so much online innovation</span></q></p> \n<p>Advocates worry that without net neutrality, the internet would become less hospitable to new companies and innovative ideas. For example, if large ISPs began requiring video-streaming sites to pay extra to deliver video content to their customers, the expense and hassle of negotiating deals with dozens of network owners could make it difficult for the next YouTube to get traction.</p> \n<p>Net neutrality supporters also worry that incumbent broadband providers could deliberately hobble new services that represent a competitive threat. For example, cable companies might want to slow down services such as Netflix that compete with their paid television service.</p> \n<h3>3) It seems like we've been arguing about network neutrality for a long time. What's taking so long?</h3> \n<p><img src=""http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2445328/88520492.0.jpg"" alt=""88520492.0.jpg"" data-chorus-asset-id=""2445328""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Former FCC chairman Julius Genachowski, whose 2010 network neutrality regulations were rejected by the courts in 2014. (Robert Giroux/Getty Images)</p> \n<p>For nearly a decade, the Federal Communications Commission has been trying and failing to craft network neutrality rules that will pass muster with the courts. In <a href=""https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2008/08/fcc-rules-against-comcast-bit-torrent-blocking"" target=""_blank"">2008</a>, and <a href=""http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2010/12/its-here-fcc-adopts-net-neutrality-lite/"" target=""_blank"">again in 2010</a>, the FCC took action to prohibit discrimination by internet service providers.</p> \n<p>But in both cases, the courts ruled that the FCC had exceeded its authority, sending the agency back to the drawing board. The last time this occurred was in <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2014/01/14/d-c-circuit-court-strikes-down-net-neutrality-rules/"" target=""_blank"">January 2014</a>, when the courts said the agency's 2010 rules weren't consistent with the law.</p> \n<h3>4) Why do advocates want the internet to be regulated like a public utility?</h3> \n<p>Last May, Chairman Wheeler proposed regulations that network neutrality supporters derided as too weak. Since then, grassroots activists have been urging the FCC to take a controversial step called reclassification, which would give the FCC broader authority by declaring internet access to be a public utility. President Barack Obama <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/11/10/7185979/obama-reclassification"" target=""_blank"">endorsed this idea</a> back in November.</p> \n<p><span>To understand reclassification, we have to go back to 1996, the year Congress last overhauled telecommunications law. That law established two legal categories:</span></p> \n<ul> \n<li> <b>Telecommunications services</b> are services, such as a traditional phone line, that are considered common carriers. The law imposes a wide variety of legal obligations on telecommunications services and gives the FCC broad discretion to regulate them.</li> \n<li> <b>Information services</b> are services that allow people to store, process, and publish information online. In 1996, that meant online services like AOL. Today, it includes websites like YouTube or Facebook. These services are exempt from most FCC regulations.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>The FCC lost in court last year because it had previously decided that broadband is an information service, and is therefore exempt from most regulation. However, the FCC has the power to decide which category to put broadband services into, and it can change its mind if it wants to.</p> \n<p>Wheeler's announcement is a significant because he doesn't just endorse network neutrality — he's been an avowed supporter of the concept all along — but endorses reclassification too. If his fellow Democrats agree, as they are expected to, the FCC will have stronger powers to protect an open internet.</p> \n<h3>5) What are the arguments against Wheeler's proposal?</h3> \n<p><img src=""http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2445334/167505727.0.jpg"" alt=""167505727.0.jpg"" data-chorus-asset-id=""2445334""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Google officials announce the expansion of their fiber broadband service to Provo, UT, in 2013. (George Frey/Getty Images)</p> \n<p>Critics of network neutrality argue that requiring networks to treat all traffic the same could discourage beneficial innovation by network owners. For example, some applications (such as voice calling and online games) are particularly sensitive to delays delivering internet content. Internet users might benefit if they could pay a premium to ensure that these applications are given priority, but strict net neutrality rules could prevent that.</p> \n<p>Network neutrality opponents also worry that regulations could discourage investment in network infrastructure. In some parts of the country, companies such as Verizon and Google have built new fiber-optic networks that allow speeds as high as 1 gigabit per second — 100 times faster than typical networks today. But these networks can cost billions of dollars to build, so many parts of the country haven't gotten them yet. If network neutrality rules make networks less profitable, that could slow the pace of investment.</p> \n<p>Beyond these general arguments against network neutrality regulation, opponents also argue there are specific problems with reclassifying broadband as a high-regulation telecommunications service. Reclassification would trigger a number of regulations designed for public utilities such as old-fashioned telephone service. For example, the law imposes a complex system of price regulations on telecommunications providers. Critics say this cumbersome and bureaucratic rate-setting process is ill-suited for the fast-changing internet economy. Net neutrality opponents<b> </b>say these and other outdated rules would strangle the internet in red tape, reducing the pace of innovation.</p> \n<h3>6) How have Republicans reacted to Wheeler's proposal?</h3> \n<p>Most Republicans oppose reclassification, and they have been working to preempt Wheeler's proposal with network-neutrality legislation of their own. In January, Sen. John Thune (R-SD) and Rep. Fred Upton (R-MI), who chair the commerce committees of the Senate and House, respectively, <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/1/21/7867869/net-neutrality-republican-compromise"">announced</a> that they were working on legislation to protect network neutrality without treating internet access like a public utility.</p> \n<p>This represents a shift for Republicans. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/11/10/7186317/obamacare-for-the-internet-ted-cruz"">declared network neutrality</a> to be ""Obamacare for the internet"" just last November, and Upton himself <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://energycommerce.house.gov/press-release/upton-and-walden-respond-fcc-vote-proposed-net-neutrality-rules"">described network neutrality</a> as a ""solution in search of a problem"" in May. But Upton says he's is so concerned about reclassification that he's willing to give ground in order to avoid it.</p> \n<p>But Thune and Upton's overtures haven't been greeted warmly by network-neutrality supporters. Some of them have <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/1/21/7867869/net-neutrality-republican-compromise"">described it</a> as a ""cynical ploy"" to undermine support for stronger network-neutrality rules. So far, President Obama, Chairman Wheeler, and other senior Democrats have shown little interest in compromising with the Republicans.</p> \n<p>But Thune hasn't been deterred. This week, as the FCC was preparing to vote, he <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.nationaljournal.com/congress/sen-john-thune-will-lean-on-fcc-over-net-neutrality-rule-20150226"">vowed to press forward</a> with his own legislation. He'll be holding more hearings on the topic next month.</p> \n<h3>7) This is complicated! Can we take a music break?</h3> \n<p>Sure. Listen to Britney Spears, one of the first pop stars of the internet age, crooning ""E-Mail My Heart.""</p> \n<p><iframe width=""420"" height=""315"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/vXzy9TRfXkQ"" frameborder=""0""></iframe></p> \n<p>The song comes courtesy of YouTube. While YouTube is now owned by Google, it began as a startup — exactly the kind of independent online service that network neutrality advocates say might have trouble getting off the ground without network neutrality.</p> \n<h3>8) Would Wheeler's proposal give the FCC authority to deal with disputes like the 2014 fight between Netflix and Comcast?</h3> \n<p><span>Advocates of a level playing field online have become increasingly concerned about broadband providers abusing their power in ways that aren't covered by conventional network neutrality regulations.</span></p> \n<p>Traditionally, net neutrality rules focus on the connection between a broadband provider (like Comcast or Verizon) and the end consumer. But large broadband providers also have connections to a variety of other parts of the internet. These connections also provide opportunities for broadband providers to make mischief, yet many network neutrality proposals haven't focused on this part of the internet.</p> \n<p><q class=""right"" aria-hidden=""true""><span>Netflix has accused Comcast of deliberately provoking the crisis by refusing to upgrade its network</span></q></p> \n<p>A controversy last year year illustrates the danger. In February 2014, Netflix agreed to pay Comcast to ensure that its videos would play smoothly for Comcast customers. The company <a href=""https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2014/04/netflix-and-verizon-reach-interconnection-deal-to-speed-up-video/"" target=""_blank"" sl-processed=""1"">signed a similar deal</a> with Verizon in April 2014.

Netflix realized it would be at a competitive disadvantage if it didn't pay for speedier service.

I was tired all the time. I had stinging back pain. Even though I worked out three days a week, a few hours of spotty exercise couldn't undo the other 10 hours a day I spent hunched over at a laptop.</p> \n<p>My body was at the breaking point, and so like many of my desk-chained brethren, I dabbled with popular alternatives. They all failed: <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/5/20/5731692/the-surprising-history-of-the-cubicle-and-the-rest-of-the-modern"" target=""_blank"">standing desks</a> smoked my lower back, <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/9/3/6098671/how-to-lose-weight-diet-studies-low-carb-low-fat"" target=""_blank"">dieting</a> was a recipe for <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/9/12/6139867/how-many-people-who-start-weight-watchers-maintain-their-goal-weight-obesity"" target=""_blank"">yo-yo weight loss</a>, and occasional walking breaks ended up as an ironic trip to the office snack room.</p> \n<p>I've come to realize most conventional solutions to office-induced poor health are entirely too pessimistic. They all assume that the best we can do is mildly reduce the <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/7/2/5862026/sitting-vs-standing-health-risks-dangers"" target=""_blank"">inevitable self-destruction</a> of our jobs.</p> \n<p>I was convinced this pessimism was misguided; desk jobs don't have to make us fatter, sicker, and duller. It's possible to transform nearly any office into a place that leaves us fitter and more energized than when we stumble in with a morning Starbucks. Here's what I did — and what you can do:</p> \n<div class=""float-left s-sidebar"">\n<img src=""http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2450702/FitnessAtTheOffice-05.0.png"" alt=""FitnessAtTheOffice-05.0.png"" data-chorus-asset-id=""2450702""> \n<h4>How is this article different from all other articles?</h4> \n<p>This is first in a regular Vox series on better living through technology and science. I, your humble guinea pig, will subject myself to all sorts of experiments to discover what practical tips readers can apply to their lives immediately.</p> \n<p>What makes this series different from traditional health writing is its emphasis on the techniques of ""quantified self"": the science of self-improvement. No single study can tell you, exactly, how a diet or exercise regimen will impact your particular body. When it comes to health, we're all individual snowflakes.</p> \n<p>For instance, within a study that finds that low-carb diets help participants lose weight, some may have lost none at all. Quantified self helps us figure out how to apply research to ourselves, by carefully measuring our progress with available consumer tools.</p> \n<p>All of the techniques in this post worked for me. If they also work for you, it most certainly won't be the exact same amount, but I will show you how to measure it yourself.</p> \n</div> \n<h3>1) I replaced lunch and morning coffee with brief exercise</h3> \n<p>The body and mind share a love of exercise, which is why when I'm feeling sluggish, I perform a brief but strenuous workout to kick my brain back into gear. Research has <a href=""http://dericbownds.net/uploaded_images/exercise_hillman.pdf"">consistently</a> shown the fitness nuts exhibit brain wave patterns associated with sustained attention; this is precisely <a href=""http://online.wsj.com/articles/exercise-helps-children-with-adhd-in-study-1410216881"">why schools</a> are turning to gym class as the treatment to spacey children who would otherwise be drugged with Adderall into attentive submission.</p> \n<p>Now, exercise has helped me overcome drowsiness during the two parts of my day when I used to turn to food: in the morning, and at midday.</p> \n<p><span><b>In the morning:</b> Instead of standing 20 minutes in line with the early morning drones to shell out $4 for a cup of legal stimulants, I discovered that I could get most of the benefits of caffeine with just 30 seconds of exercise.</span></p> \n<p>Right when I wake up (or anytime I feel sleepy), I jumpstart my heart to about 165 beats per minute with 30 seconds of jumping-jack pushups (a ""burpee"") or mountain climbers. Immediately, I feel a surge of energy that boosts my cognitive state more than caffeine.</p> \n<p>To objectively test my intuition, I compared 30 seconds of exercise to 250 mg of caffeine — the equivalent of a cup of drip coffee — on a series of complex reaction time tests, a common metric for cognitive performance.</p> \n<p>Compared to caffeine, my reaction times post-exercise were about double (12 percent vs. six percent over a baseline test). My short-term memory got an even bigger boost (26 percent vs. 16 percent). My own experience jibes <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22480735"">with a 2012 meta-analysis</a> that found that high-intensity exercise tended to have the largest impact on cognitive function, compared to lower-intensity exercises.</p> \n<p>Most importantly, the research found that exercises that add muscle-building resistance training are the most effective overall. Not only am I making my brain sharper, but my abs more chiseled.</p> \n<p>30-second breaks are stellar for an early-morning pickup, but they aren't sufficient to get me through my productivity arch nemesis: the post-lunch afternoon lull.</p> \n<p><b>At lunchtime: </b>Afternoon meals are a productivity ball-and-chain. About an hour after a hearty lunch, I'm a work zombie. Nutritional neuroscientists have come to expect this crash: ""consumption of lunch has been most often reported to impair mental performance and negatively alter mood state,"" wrote Tufts University's Caroline R. Mahoney and her research team in a comprehensive review of food's effect on cognitive performance [<a href=""http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/u/strommer/Nutritional%20Neuroscience/TF1702_Ch06.pdf"">PDF</a>].</p> \n<p>Scientists don't actually know why a meal makes us drowsy; the <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/11/22/sleepy-after-eating-a-big-meal-why_n_2171058.html"">current theory</a> hypothesizes that the hormonal response to digesting food (blood glucose) also switches off so-called ""orexin"" neurons meant to keep us awake during the hunting process. In other words, after we feed, our body thinks it has done its job and wants to spend the remaining energy absorbing the nutrient goodness in sleepy peace.</p> \n<q>Lunch made me, literally, slower: my reaction times sank, as did my short-term memory performance</q> \n<p>So, instead of wasting my lunch period waiting in line for what is essentially a glorified sleeping pill, I do my afternoon workout. Sweaty exercise gets the blood pumping and I feel refreshed enough to crush the second half of the day, all while surrounded by colleagues that would trade their next of kin for a nap.</p> \n<p>But, like all scientific research, the results tend to be mixed. <a href=""http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00409386#page-1"">Older research</a> on lunch finds that people who regularly eat a big meal don't experience the same crash. So, I conducted a self-experiment measuring my cognitive prowess two hours after either a nice long run on an empty stomach or a super-healthy lunch from the San Francisco Farmer's Market.</p> \n<p>My intuition was confirmed. Compared to eating a sizable portion of salad and and salmon, exercise increased my short-term working memory by seven percent and my complex reaction time test by 13 percent . Lunch made me, literally, slower: my reaction times sank by 12 percent, as did my short-term memory performance (11 percent).</p> \n<p>For those who can't leave the office for a run, <a href=""http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/05/09/the-scientific-7-minute-workout/?_php=true&amp;_type=blogs&amp;_r=0"">the scientific seven-minute workout</a> is a great body-weight all-round routine that also leaves me refreshed. It combines a series of body-weight exercises in rapid succession and builds many of the same muscles as a typical gym session.</p> \n<p>I still eat lunch, but it tends to be very light. I'll munch on a small salad with loads of dense healthy fats (olive oil) — this keeps me filled and primed for work.</p> \n<h4>How to do these experiments yourself</h4> \n<p><b>Essential technology: </b><span>I find that I get the most bang for my workout buck if I can feel my heart thumping through my chest. For me, that's about 168 beats per minute, or what is known as my anaerobic </span><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactate_threshold"" style=""line-height: 1.5; background-color: #ffffff;"">threshold</a><span>, the point at which the body consumes more energy than it can reproduce.</span></p> \n<p>Here's how I use the tech: I strap on an exercise-grade heart rate monitor — any device that's not specifically designed for resting heart-rate only. I used a Polar chest strap, but the upcoming Microsoft Health band, which doesn't require a chest strap, is probably a more convenient solution. Then, I perform some high-intensity exercise until I reach my desired beats per minute.</p> \n<p>Once I intuit what it takes to feel my heart thumping in various exercises, I no longer need the heart-rate monitor for short bouts of exercise. For longer workouts, like those that replace my lunch, I nearly <i>always</i> use a heart-rate monitor. It's the only thing that keeps me honest about how hard I need to work.</p> \n<p><b>Measuring results: </b><span>I want exercise to make me sharper, so I record my mental state before and after each experiment.</span></p> \n<p>The simplest way to measure cognitive focus is with a simple reaction time test. <a href=""http://humanbenchmark.com/"" target=""_blank"">HumanBenchmark.com</a> has super-simple 'red light-green light' game on the front page and only takes about 20 seconds to complete.</p> \n<p>For more advanced work, I used the website <a href=""http://www.quantified-mind.com/"">quantified-mind.com</a>, which has every imaginable psychometric test, from complex reaction times to short-term memory. I designed my own six-minute evaluation system, called the ""Ferenstein short"" test, which is free to the public.</p> \n<q>A heart-rate monitor is the only thing that keeps me honest about how hard I need to work</q> \n<p>The simplest way to track progress on a self-experiment is with a smartphone. I type in my pre-test scores on a notepad or to-do list, perform an exercise, and then record my post-test scores, noting the time and day. Your notes should have everything you need to measure the percent improvement.</p> \n<p>Pre- and post-tests are key to doing self-experimentation with scientific rigor. Each day, I will have generally better or worse focus, depending on how well I sleep, my level of stress, or a million other factors. I do a pre-test right before I exercise and then perform my post-test about an hour after<b> </b>exercise — or at whatever time of day I usually start to nod off. Doing this <i>right</i> after exercise will give you false results, since your heart rate will still be much higher than usual and the test won't tell you how the treatment lingers.</p> \n<p>You'll have to play with the timing, too. For me, the effects of high-intensity exercise only last about 90 minutes; the research suggests that it may not be so effective at all for couch potatoes, whose bodies aren't used to intense workouts.</p> \n<p>Self-experimentation requires a bit of intuition to understand your own state of mind and then begin systematic measurement after you suspect a pattern emerging.</p> \n<h3>2) I started stretching during phone calls</h3> \n<p>I used to just accept chronic joint pain as an unfortunate fact of modern life, like traffic congestion and Hillary Clinton presidential speculation. It never occurred to me that the inability to touch my toes could be the reason for my achy back. I should have known I wasn't alone: research finds that people with tight hamstrings <a href=""http://www.scopemed.org/?mno=160180"">complain</a> of lower back pain more often, because the body strains torso muscles to make up for the inflexibility.</p> \n<p>I never bothered to put much time into stretching because I naively ignored how important it was to both my performance during exercise and being less injury-prone throughout the day.</p> \n<p>""Flexibility is the third pillar of fitness, next to cardiovascular conditioning and strength training,"" <a href=""http://www.cnn.com/2010/HEALTH/08/21/increase.flexibility.realsimple/"">said</a> David Geier, the director of sports medicine at the Medical University of South Carolina.</p> \n<div class=""float-right""><img src=""http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2450708/FitnessAtTheOffice-04.0.png"" alt=""FitnessAtTheOffice-04.0.png"" data-chorus-asset-id=""2450708""></div> \n<p>Fortunately, there's a delightful opportunity for stretching in the bureaucratic space-time continuum: conference calls. Audio communication provides the perfect blind spot to perform all the awkward contortions of a mobility routine without interrupting the conversation.</p> \n<p>Stretching is intellectually effortless; it occupies the body and leaves the mind free to chime in with an occasional ""Uh huh, good idea, Ted. I'll circle back after this call.""</p> \n<p><b>For the pros — myofascial release:</b> <span>Some light passive stretching is always a nice way relieve a sore back or add injury-resistant slack to tight muscles. But, the traditional type stretching, known as </span><i style=""line-height: 1.5;"">passive stretching</i><span>, never seemed to increase my range of motion much. I just used to believe that I wasn't capable of much flexibility.</span></p> \n<p>Then I learned about a more advanced strategy that<b> </b>would radically improve my range of motion and decrease pain: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myofascial_release"">myofascial release</a>, self-administered deep-tissue massage.</p> \n<p>Myofascial release (""rolling out"") is a <a href=""http://health.usnews.com/health-news/blogs/eat-run/2013/10/25/a-guide-to-foam-rolling"">common physical therapy technique</a>, which has ballooned into a cottage industry of foam rollers for at-home use. Myofascial release is the equivalent of paying a professional bodyworker to dig their thumb through tightened muscles.</p> \n<p>Instead of paying a professional once a week, I strategically roll on a lacrosse ball or spikey foam roller for about 15 minutes a day. I find that myofascial release is the prerequisite to for stretching to be effective, otherwise I can stretch all I want and I don't see much improvement.</p> \n<p>A fair bit of warning: myofascial release can hurt. For beginners, it's difficult to distinguish between the productive pain of breaking up scar tissue and the destructive pain of wrongly grinding a ball into your joints. I started myofascial release after a thorough consultation with a professional.</p> \n<p>But now I look forward phone calls. Whether it's poor posture, sore feet, or achy shoulders, I use this time to get more limber than Gumby at a circus academy.</p> \n<h4>How to do these experiments yourself</h4> \n<p><b>Essential technology: </b><a style=""line-height: 1.5; background-color: #ffffff;"" href=""http://www.mobilitywod.com/episodes/"">MobilityWOD</a><span> is my go-to encyclopedia for stretching and mobility. Depending on what ails you, a medical professional will let you know where you need to work. It's important to keep in mind that the site of pain is not always the source. For me, inflexible legs and hips were destroying my lower back. So, now I work through all of MobilityWODs videos on how to loosen up my legs. Here's an example of one of Kelly Starrett's colorful mobility videos:</span></p> \n<p> </p> \n<center><iframe width=""560"" height=""315"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/KCEpe4hqyEI"" frameborder=""0""></iframe></center> \n<p> </p> \n<p>His (somewhat technical) video can be boiled down to a few points: <span>anyone can do mobility work/myofascial release on their own.</span><span> If a site is painful to pressure from a roller or ball, it's a good sign that it's a part of the body that's causing pain and stiffness.</span><span> Roll on a site for at least two minutes, then check to see if things feel better and if range of motion has increased.</span></p> \n<p>The basic gear you need<b> </b>to do these exercises is pretty inexpensive. I don't mind the pain, so I roll out my muscles with a standard lacrosse ball (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/b?ie=UTF8&amp;node=3414531"">$3 on Amazon</a>) and the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_1?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=rumble+roller&amp;rh=i%3Aaps%2Ck%3Arumble+roller&amp;ajr=0"">Rumble Roller</a> ($40). I find rolling on on a tennis ball is less painful, but the progress is slower. There's an <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/TriggerPoint"">entire cottage industry</a> of at-home physical therapy tools, which a professional can advise.</p> \n<p><b>Measuring results: </b><span>Measuring is the easiest for flexibility, but there's nothing universal. I expect immediate results from myofascial release. If I intend to smash my calves so that I can bend over farther, I pre-test my range of motion by seeing how much farther I can reach beyond my toes. Then, I smash my muscles for the medically advisable amount of time and see if I can reach farther. If I make no progress, I look for another solution or another site that could be the culprit behind my pain and stiffness.</span></p> \n<p>Each of MobilityWOD's videos will give advice on the amount of time and ways to test for improvement on the different muscle sites.</p> \n<h3><span>3) I ditched my sitting and standing standing desks for a treadmill</span></h3> \n<p>It's pretty much accepted dogma among health professionals that any prolonged posture is a killer for both body and mind. Sitting is associated with fatigue, joint pain, and early death. The current trend sweeping the health community is the standing desk, but there's little evidence they are much better.</p> \n<p>Standing desks are a ""creative idea, but it's not been scientifically proven,"" Pennington Biomedical Research Professor, Marc Hamilton, told ABC News. ""As of now, there's really no research to show they do any good.""</p> \n<p>I found standing desks just replaced upper back pain with lower back pain — and my legs were constantly tired. Standing desks also have all <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_desk#Purported_health_benefits_and_risks"">nasty side effects of standing retail jobs, such as varicose veins and knee pain</a>.</p> \n<p>So, to keep my body moving, I transitioned to a walking desk, a flatbed treadmill attached underneath a standing desk. Walking at an average pace of 1.0 mph, I burned 3.5 calories per minute, compared to 1.2 calories per minute standing, and 1 calorie per minute sitting. Over the course of a morning, I'll burn more than 650 calories, or the equivalent of my entire lunch.</p> \n<p>In total, on days when I sit (or travel), I burn roughly 2,400 calories per day, compared to 3,500 when I walk at my desk.</p> \n<q>My desk has become the place where I burn the most calories, where I exercise to keep my mind refreshed</q> \n<p>Is it hard to walk and think at the same time? No more than walking and talking. In fact, the <a href=""http://techcrunch.com/2014/03/07/study-shows-why-its-worth-your-employers-money-to-buy-everyone-walking-desks/"">two studies to test the cognitive impact</a> of treadmill desks find that they <i>increase</i> productivity. Compared to sitting, doctors who walked at 1MPH were significantly more accurate at diagnosing CAT scan images (89 percent vs. 99 percent accuracy).</p> \n<p>A second study found that when a treadmill desk was introduced into an office, those who regularly walked while working enjoyed 10 percent higher employer satisfaction ratings.</p> \n<p>I initially doubted these results until I began using a treadmill regularly. At first, walking and working was difficult: I could muster only 90 minutes a day. Now, after a year, it's the reverse: I sit only 90 minutes a day.</p> \n<p>An important step I had to take to make this happen: I threw out all my chairs. <a href=""http://techcrunch.com/2014/03/07/study-shows-why-its-worth-your-employers-money-to-buy-everyone-walking-desks/"">In academic studies</a>, workplaces that introduce walking desks see about 75 minutes per day of use per employee. <a href=""https://i.imgur.com/aUyraGC.jpg"">That's the calorie equivalent of half a bagel</a>.</p> \n<p>However, physiologically speaking, humans were not meant to sit much at all. The nasty office temptress that prevented me from walking as much as my mailman was the humble office chair. A brief rest from walking would turn into 2 hours of hunchback lounging.</p> \n<p>So, I purged my office of all chairs. Tossed. Every. Single. Chair.</p> \n<p>I replaced them with the Japanese Zafu , a two-foot diameter bean bag raised 10 inches off the the ground with no back. Zafus are designed to naturally orient the body into a pristine, upright meditation pose, since leaning back on a raised surface is as uncomfortable as biking on a bumpy road wearing a thong.</p> \n<p>With a Zafu, there's no temptation to drift off into the productivity black hole of a slouched position watching YouTube. No I office I have will ever have any chair ever again.</p> \n<h4><span>How to do these experiments yourself</span></h4> \n<p><b>Essential technology:</b> <span>When I'm on the road, </span><a style=""line-height: 1.5; background-color: #ffffff;"" href=""http://www.amazon.com/Connect-A-Desk-Mobile-Laptop-Harness-Desk/dp/B001G713NO"">I obviously can't fold up a treadmill desk into luggage</a><span>. So, I travel with a laptop harness, the Connect-A-Desk. It's an imperfect, awkward solution that allows me to walk around while working at the same time. I'm often too embarrassed to bring the connect-a-desk outside, but I find it's great for walking around a hotel room.</span></p> \n<p>It also helps to keep a pedometer; when I first started walking out, I walked three to six miles a day, and a pedometer keeps me honest about how much I'm actually moving around. There are only two popular pedometers on the market that can track steps while at a walking desk: the <a href=""http://www.theverge.com/2014/9/16/6219935/misfit-flash-fitness-tracker-announcement-pricing-release-date"">Misfit flash</a> and the Fitbit One.</p> \n<p>Wrist-worn activity trackers, like the Jawbone and Fitbit Flex, can't recognize steps while my hands are typing on a keyboard. The Misfit is my favorite because it doesn't need charging, has pretty smartphone integration, and can recognize other types of exercise, should I do them throughout the day. It's also half the cost of the Fitbit.</p> \n<p>For sitting, a Zafu runs about $40 on Amazon. I also like the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/BackJoy-BJCAM001-Core-Black/dp/B004WO5UXC"">BackJoy</a> floor chair, which swivels to orient the pelvis into an upright position. I don't like stability balls for chairs. <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16410033"">The research</a> on their benefits is mixed and its still a chair — and chairs are evil.</p> \n<p><b>Measuring results: </b><span>The goal here is just to maximize movement. I measure it two different ways.</span></p> \n<div class=""float-right""><img src=""http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2450714/FitnessAtTheOffice-03.0.png"" alt=""FitnessAtTheOffice-03.0.png"" data-chorus-asset-id=""2450714""></div> \n<p>First, sitting for any extended amount of time for <i>any</i> reason can cause muscle stiffness. The Basis watch has a feature that allows me to track sitting for a specified amount of time. My daily target is 30 minutes. I try to minimize the number of times per day I sit longer than 30 minutes, and Basis will reward me if I haven't sat longer than that amount of time.</p> \n<p>Second, my goal for steps and calories burned is simply the maximum I can tolerate. On a monthly basis, I try to exceed my previous goals. Over the last year, I've worked my way up to a comfortable 10 to 12 miles per day, so 10 miles is my current goal with my Misfit app. If my feet hurt or legs hurt the next day, I scale back. And, If I'm trying to lose fat, I'll move my goal up to my upper limit until I get to my desired body fat percentage.<b></b></p> \n<p><b>For the pros: crank up the MPH, walk a half-marathon, and get some vaseline: </b><span>To fight off afternoon drowsiness and fuel the fat burning, I crank up my treadmill to speeds somewhere between two and 3.5 miles per hour. That's about the speed at which movie super villains move through crowds when they don't want to break into a conspicuous run. At an average of 2.5 miles per hour, four hours a day. That's an extra six miles a day.</span></p> \n<p>My record so far is a near full marathon: 18.5 miles walked in a single day, with zero loss in productivity. Now, I typically walk between 10 and 14 miles per day. In addition to great cardio, I burn an extra 1,000 to 2,000 calories a day.</p> \n<p><b>Essential technology: </b><span>The cognitive benefits are wonderful and it's great to shed fat while working, but there are a few downsides. One, I need running shoes. At more than 2.0 mph, fancy work shoes won't cut it and neither will bare feet.</span></p> \n<p>Additionally, since I'm essentially walking a half-marathon, I have to prep my body for one — that means lubricant or long sports underwear. Without a generous amount of vaseline on my inner thighs. I develop chaff sores the size of genetically enhanced strawberries.</p> \n<p>Finally, walking several miles a day can do a number on your feet. If I don't walk correctly, I'm in pain for the next few days. The upcoming <a href=""http://www.theverge.com/2014/10/9/6951929/sensoria-running-fitness-tracker"">Sensoria smart sock</a> can sense how feet strike the ground. I tend to pigeon-toe when I walk, and Sensoria has a built-in robotic coach to let me know when my form is failing.</p> \n<h3>4)I started going outside to answer email</h3> \n<p>The body is a nutritional sponge; the mouth is just one sensory organ designed to convert nature into fuel for the body. But, as a desk-chained worker, my body was losing out on one of nature's most powerful ingredients: sunlight.</p> \n<p>Skin <a href=""http://www.health.harvard.edu/newsweek/vitamin-d-and-your-health.htm"">soaks up ultraviolet light</a> (UVB) and converts it to Vitamin D, an essential nutrient in bone health and for absorbing other nutrients. The CDC <a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2012/p0402_vitamins_nutrients.html"">estimates</a> that roughly three percent of whites and 30 percent of African Americans are deficient in this essential vitamin. As someone who got little to no sunlight, I wasn't surprised when my WellnessFX blood panel alerted me that I was one of the millions Americans with a D deficiency.</p> \n<p>I could take vitamin pills, but a <a href=""http://annals.org/article.aspx?articleid=1789253"">recent panel of respected doctors</a> has issued a stern warning against most popular supplements, so I didn't want a solution<b> </b>to potentially cause a much more dangerous problem.</p> \n<p>Then I discovered a ready-made solution to boost my nutrition levels, increase my productivity, and boost cognitive function: sending emails while walking outside.</p> \n<p>Just in terms of productivity, emailing on my smartphone forces me to be super efficient. Emails are necessarily kept short and I've learned that I (very) rarely ever need to send a long email. Even better, it's damn near impossible to multi-task on a phone, so there's no temptation to drift off to viral-video land in between messages. The limited functionality of a phone keeps me delightfully on task.</p> \n<q>Emailing on my smartphone forces me to be super efficient. Emails are necessarily kept short.</q> \n<p>Even better, the signature orange tint of natural light triggers the brain to focus. Orange light is like a natural clock that tells the body it shouldn't prepare for rest. In controlled studies, subjects <a href=""http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn25195-a-burst-of-orange-light-wakes-up-our-circadian-eye.html#.VD2x_yldV3o"">exposed</a> to artificial orange light boosts performed better on a memory test compared to a control group.</p> \n<p>""Light therapy is great but can be replaced/complemented by outside exposures if it's relatively bright, i.e. not gray and dull (and wet),"" the studies co-author, Giles Vandewalle, wrote to me in an email.</p> \n<p>So, to test the effects, I took a stroll outside during San Francisco's blazing heat wave to see how sun affected my brain after a reading task in the afternoon, when I normally start nodding off.</p> \n<p>On simple reaction-time test, a solid measure of drowsiness, I experienced no dip in performance compared to a slight decrease (4 percent) when I walked on a treadmill indoors. Four percent may not sound like a lot, but I experience a 14-percent dip on the same test when I'm extremely tired. So, at least for my short test, getting some sunlight was important for keeping me alert.</p> \n<h4><span>How to do these experiments yourself</span></h4> \n<p><b>Essential tech: </b><span>My absolute favorite smartphone mail application is Mailbox. It's gotten rave </span><a style=""line-height: 1.5; background-color: #ffffff;"" href=""http://www.theverge.com/2014/4/9/5594996/inbox-hero-inside-mailboxs-master-plan-to-make-email-suck-less"">reviews</a><span> from just about every tech outlet for its swiping-centric interface, which allows users to quickly archive and set unanswered emails to return to the inbox.

As with the previous instructions on these sites, I write down my pre- and post-test results in my smartphone, with date and time recorded, so that I can detect the percent difference compared to a baseline.</p> \n<hr> \n<p>Now, when I want to drop weight on a new diet, I prefer to be at my desk; it's become the place where I burn the most calories. It's also where I stretch to reduce pain and exercise to keep my mind refreshed all day long.</p> \n<p>For most decisions in life, we must make hard choices between difficult trade-offs. But, when it comes to transforming our offices into an oasis of super-fitness, it's pretty much all win-win.</p> \n<p>I feel better when I'm walking instead of sitting. I enjoy the feeling of stretching during calls and the rush of energy I feel after 30 seconds of exercise. It's natural for our bodies to move all day. The only thing that has been holding our offices back is pessimism — a pessimism that puts us on a spiraling path toward fatigue, depression, and pain.</p> \n<hr> \n<div style=""text-align:center; width: 50%; margin: 0 auto;"">\n<span class=""credit""> Editor: <a href=""http://twitter.com/eleanorbarkhorn"">Eleanor Barkhorn</a></span> <br> Designer: <a href=""https://twitter.com/komickiller"">Tyson Whiting</a><br>\n</div> \n</div>",Television
5 banks fined $3.3 billion for colluding to manipulate foreign currency markets,http://www.vox.com/2014/11/12/7203491/foreign-currency-fine,The financial cops are getting tougher.,"<ul> \n<li><span>Early on the morning of November 12, regulators from three countries levied $3.3 billion in fines against five banks for illegally colluding to manipulate foreign exchange markets.</span></li> \n<li><span>The targets are UBS, HSBC, the Royal Bank of Scotland, JP Morgan Chase, and Citibank. The fines were levied by the United States, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland.</span></li> \n<li><span>The fine is a record for Britain's Financial Services Authority, though the US and Swiss regulators who joined in the settlement have<a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/8/8/5979563/bank-of-americas-17-billion-penalty-is-arguably-too-little-definitely"" target=""_blank""> issued bigger penalties</a> in the past. </span></li> \n<li><span>The settlement does not resolve an ongoing criminal investigation by the <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/8/8/5979563/bank-of-americas-17-billion-penalty-is-arguably-too-little-definitely"" target=""_blank"">US Department of Justice</a> into the matter. </span></li> \n</ul> \n<h3>The background</h3> \n<p>The case does not have anything to do with the major themes of the financial crisis, except in the very broad sense that it involves bank misconduct. At issue is trades in the foreign exchange (forex or FX to the cool kids) markets, where dollars are swapped for yen and euros for Swiss francs. In most markets, it is illegal for traders to engage in a practice known as <i>front running</i> where a dealer uses his knowledge of clients' proposed trades to make profitable trades in advance.</p> \n<p>For example, if you know your client wants to buy an enormous amount of General Motors stock you could go buy GM shares for yourself and take advantage of the price hike that will be induced by your client's purchase. You could do it, that is, except it would be illegal.</p> \n<p>The foreign exchange markets are not regulated in this way, and front running is not against the rules. That's because traditionally regulators have taken the view that the FX market is too big to be profitably manipulated in this way. But it turns out that traders from different banks were cooperating with each other to coordinate moves and make front running possible.</p> \n<p>Regulators charge that this coordination was illegal. Since the banks have settled the charges and agreed to pay fines, they are not defending the conduct. But outside skeptics of the charges note that this is more a case of regulators <a href=""http://t.co/caFKhw9HnB"" target=""_blank"">changing their mind about what's allowed</a> than of scandalous new conduct.</p> \n<blockquote lang=""en"" class=""twitter-tweet""> \n<p>could almost summarise the FX thing as ""clients didn't ask for best execution, they didn't pay for it but by God they should have got it!""</p> \n— Dan Davies (@dsquareddigest) <a href=""https://twitter.com/dsquareddigest/status/532517729886949376"">November 12, 2014</a>\n</blockquote> \n<h3>Why it matters</h3> \n<p>The fines themselves are of relatively little consequence; the banks involved can absorb the losses. What's interesting is that while industry insiders have continuously hoped that the regulatory environment would get laxer as we moved further from the financial crisis, actual political developments seem to have gone in the opposite direction.</p> \n<p>But the UK government is levying <i>bigger</i> fines than ever before, and a US Justice Department which has <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/9/25/6844023/holder-doj-bank-prosecutions"">long been gun-shy about criminal charges</a> is now attempting to build a case. This is not the direction the financial services industry wants to see things move in, but it indicates that regulators are continuing to feel public pressure to show they're serious about financial misconduct.</p>",Television
American broadband is better than you think,http://www.vox.com/2014/11/29/7281809/american-broadband-pretty-good,"Critics often point to Europe's internet access as a model, but the US outperforms Europe in some key ways.","<p>Is the United States falling behind the rest of the world on internet access? A lot of people think so. A recent New York Times <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/31/upshot/why-the-us-has-fallen-behind-in-internet-speed-and-affordability.html?abt=0002&amp;abg=0"">article</a> suggested, based on <a href=""http://www.newamerica.org/oti/the-cost-of-connectivity-2014/"">research</a> from the New America Foundation, that the US has ""fallen behind in internet speed and affordability."" That research found that broadband customers in America's biggest cities often paid more for slower broadband service than consumers could get in other world capitals like Tokyo, Seoul, and Paris.</p> \n<p>Yet a <a href=""http://www.aei.org/publication/g7-broadband-dynamics-policy-affects-broadband-quality-powerhouse-nations/"" target=""_blank"">new report</a> from the American Enterprise Institute offers a more optimistic take on America's broadband performance. It compares the performance of the American internet against other members of the G7,  a group of the world's largest wealthy economies. One of those nations — Japan — clearly has faster internet service than the United States. But the study's author, the AEI researcher Richard Bennett, argues that US broadband speeds compare favorably to that available in the other five G7 nations: Canada, France, Germany, Italy, and the United Kingdom.</p> \n<p>Bennett has compiled an impressive amount of data to make his case. Here are five reasons that internet access in the United States is better than many critics want to admit.</p> \n<h3>1) America has a lot of fast cable internet service</h3> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""2491760"" alt=""4505002689_788c9f49fb_b.0.jpg"" src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2491760/4505002689_788c9f49fb_b.0.jpg""></p> \n<p class=""caption""><span>A coaxial cable, cut away. (</span><a href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/usblsb/4505002689"" target=""_blank"" style=""font-size: 0.8em; text-align: inherit; line-height: 1.65;"">JUAN LUIS MARTEL</a><span>)</span></p> \n<p>Broadly speaking, there are three ways the world's households get online. The slowest technology, known as digital subscriber lines (DSL), delivers internet service over twisted-pair copper phone lines that have been in the ground for decades. In the middle are coaxial cables, which have traditionally been used for cable television. The fastest is fiber optics, a relatively new technology that sends information as pulses of light over glass strands.</p> \n<p>Which of these technologies a country uses today is strongly influenced by decisions policymakers there made decades ago. For example, Bennett says that when cable television emerged in the mid-20th century, some European countries turned the technology over to incumbent telephone monopolies to manage. These companies dragged their feet on rolling out new coaxial cables, and as a result the technology never reached many European homes.</p> \n<p>The United States pursued a different approach, making cable television a separate industry initially dominated by small companies. As a result, cable TV service grew rapidly and today almost all American homes have cable service.</p> \n<p>The result: when the internet emerged in the late 1990s, cable television was more widely available in the United States (and Canada, which took an approach similar to America's) than it was elsewhere in the developed world:</p> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""2491798"" alt=""Screen_Shot_2014-11-21_at_11.28.54_AM.0.0.png"" src=""https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2491798/Screen_Shot_2014-11-21_at_11.28.54_AM.0.0.png""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">(AEI, based on OECD data)</p> \n<p><span>Today, the United States still largely uses these decades-old cables to deliver internet access. The latest standard for delivering internet access over cable networks is called DOCSIS 3. And the technology is more widely available in the United States than any other G7 nation:</span></p> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""2491826"" alt=""Screen_Shot_2014-11-21_at_1.07.30_PM.0.0.png"" src=""https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2491826/Screen_Shot_2014-11-21_at_1.07.30_PM.0.0.png""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">(AEI, based on data from various sources)</p> \n<p>That's significant because cable-based networks tend to be faster than the DSL-based networks that predominate in major European economies. That explains why (as we'll discuss more below) the average US internet connection is faster than internet access in France or Italy.</p> \n<h3>2) The US has more fast fiber connections than most other G7 nations</h3> \n<p>Fiber optic networks are really fast. Right now, they can deliver speeds of one gigabit per second, which is 20 to 50 times the typical speed of a cable modem connection.</p> \n<p>Yet only one G7 nation — Japan — has built fiber optic networks that reach most of its citizens. The United States occupies the number two position among G7 nations, though it's <i>way</i> behind the leader:</p> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""2491838"" alt=""fiber.0.0.png"" src=""https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2491838/fiber.0.0.png""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">(AEI, based on data from various sources)</p> \n<p>In 2012, almost a quarter of US households had fiber optic service available to them, though not all households had actually signed up for service. <a href=""http://www.keepeek.com/Digital-Asset-Management/oecd/science-and-technology/oecd-communications-outlook-2013/percentage-of-fibre-connections-in-total-broadband-subscriptions-june-2012_comms_outlook-2013-graph10-en#page1"">Data</a> from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development the same year indicated that about 7 percent of US broadband connections were fiber-based. Again, that's much lower than Japan, where almost two-thirds of connections are fiber. But it's a lot more than the other five G7 countries, none of which have more than 3 percent of active internet connections using fiber optics.</p> \n<p>To sum up, here's a chart of the different technologies each country uses to deliver internet access:</p> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""2491846"" alt=""wired_subs.0.0.png"" src=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2491846/wired_subs.0.0.png""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">(AEI, based on data from OECD)</p> \n<p>As you can see, only Japan has a majority of its population on fiber optics — the red bar. The United States and United Kingdom have much smaller, but still significant, shares of their populations using fiber optic networks. Meanwhile, the United States and Canada have large fractions of their populations using cable modems. By contrast, many European households are stuck with slower DSL connections, the slowest of these three technologies.</p> \n<h3>3) US internet service is fast and getting faster</h3> \n<p>With a large share of households enjoying either fiber optic or cable connections, the average American enjoys a faster internet connection than consumers in most other G7 countries — again, with the exception of Japan.</p> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""2491854"" alt=""average_speed.0.0.png"" src=""https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2491854/average_speed.0.0.png""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">(<a href=""http://www.akamai.com/stateoftheinternet/soti-visualizations.html"" target=""_blank"">Akamai</a>)</p> \n<p>This chart comes from Akamai, which operates a network of servers that help companies deliver content to users more quickly. This role gives the company wealth of real-world data on network performance around the world, and their data suggests that the US is doing pretty well on broadband speeds.</p> \n<p>However, there's a big reason to take these figures with a grain of salt. Akamai counts each file download as a separate connection. This means that the measured connection speed can reflect factors unrelated to the speed of the underlying network, such as the number of tabs a user has open on her browser or the number of computers using a shared wifi connection.</p> \n<p>An alternative measurement is the average peak connection speed — that is, the average of the fastest speeds seen on each network connection. This provides a better estimate of the average capacity of broadband connections in a country.</p> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""2491858"" alt=""akamai_chart.0.0.png"" src=""https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2491858/akamai_chart.0.0.png""></p> \n<p class=""caption""><span>(</span><a href=""http://www.akamai.com/stateoftheinternet/soti-visualizations.html"">Akamai</a>)</p> \n<p><span>Once again, this measure shows Japan well ahead of the rest of the G7. The United States is in the next tier, slightly behind the United Kingdom and slightly ahead of Canada and Germany. France and Italy bring up the rear.</span></p> \n<h3>4) Low population density makes America's good internet performance more impressive</h3> \n<p>The more densely populated a country is, the cheaper it is to provide universal internet access. And that puts the US and Canada at a distinct disadvantage compared to other G7 nations.</p> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""2491864"" alt=""urban_density.0.0.png"" src=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2491864/urban_density.0.0.png""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">(AEI, based on data from  ITIF and Demographia)</p> \n<p>This chart shows the average population density of urban and suburban areas — defined as areas with population density greater than 1000 people per square mile. Japan has some of the most densely-populated cities on the planet, with a lot of high-rise apartment buildings. That gave Japan an advantage: it's much cheaper to string a bundle of fiber optic cables to a big apartment building, where it can serve hundreds of families, than to run individual cables to hundreds of individual homes in a suburban neighborhood.</p> \n<p>The US, Canada, and France have the least densely populated metropolitan areas by this measure. And the US and Canada also have the least densely populated rural areas:</p> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""2491924"" alt=""rural_density.0.0.png"" src=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2491924/rural_density.0.0.png""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">(AEI, based on data from World Bank, The Little Green Data Book 2011)</p> \n<p>As in cities, lower rural population densities mean higher costs: the more sparsely-populated the countryside is, the longer the cables required to reach each house.</p> \n<p>This makes the respectable performance of American broadband networks more impressive. You might expect densely-populated countries like Italy and Germany to be well ahead of the United States in average network speeds. But only Japan seems to have taken full advantage of the cost savings made possible by high population density.</p> \n<h3>5) US wireless network coverage is pretty good too</h3> \n<p>Bennett also finds that American wireless providers are leaders in deploying the latest and fastest mobile networking standard, called LTE:</p> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""2491948"" alt=""lte_coverage.0.0.png"" src=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2491948/lte_coverage.0.0.png""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">(AEI, based on various sources)</p> \n<p>Surprisingly, America's more extensive LTE coverage does not translate to higher average mobile speeds. To the contrary, most speed measurements show the United States with slower-than average mobile speeds.</p> \n<p>It's not clear why this happens, but Bennett has a theory. He points out that new networks are often fastest when they are first built and few people are using them. But wireless spectrum is a shared resource, so as more people sign up for service, the network gets congested and average speeds decline.</p> \n<p>In other words, Bennett argues that the poor performance of American wireless networks is actually a sign of their success: because American providers upgraded to LTE before those in other countries, they have more LTE customers and therefore more congested networks.</p> \n<h3>Where the United States falls short</h3> \n<p>Last week I asked Danielle Kehl, one of the researchers behind New America's more pessimistic report on American broadband, about Bennett's conclusions. While she quibbled with a few of his specific findings, she didn't disagree with his general observation that American broadband speeds were competitive with those available in the European G7 nations.</p> \n<p>However, she noted two big drawbacks to the American internet. One was price. American broadband networks might be fast, but consumers often pay a hefty premium for that extra speed.</p> \n<p>This is most noticeable at the high end of the market. For example, New America's data shows that some consumers in New York City can get a blazing fast 500 Mbps fiber optic connection from Verizon — much faster than the 200 Mbps service available in Berlin or the 150 Mbps service in London. But the New York connection costs $300 per month. In contrast, the Berlin and London connections cost less than $60.</p> \n<p>And as this chart shows, the same pattern holds at lower speeds: costs tend to be lower in Europe than in the United States for a range of different speeds.</p> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""2491958"" alt=""broadband_price.0.0.png"" src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2491958/broadband_price.0.0.png""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">(<a href=""http://www.newamerica.org/oti/the-cost-of-connectivity-2014/"" target=""_blank"">New America Foundation</a>)</p> \n<p>Kehl pointed to recent interconnection disputes — such as the <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/5/2/5665890/beyond-net-neutrality-the-new-battle-for-the-future-of-the-internet"">fight Netflix had with several large ISPs</a> earlier this year — as another sign of problems in the American broadband market. Fast connections aren't worth much if consumers can't use them to download the content they want. Network neutrality advocates worry that without legal protection for network neutrality, large ISPs will start interfering with consumers' use of their internet service, speeding up some content and slowing down others.</p>",Television

The Brian Williams helicopter scandal: a clear timeline,http://www.vox.com/2015/2/5/7987439/brian-williams-iraq-apology-helicopter,"Brian Williams told a fake story about being shot down in Iraq. Here's what he said, and what really happened.","<p>On January 30, Brian Williams spoke at a New York Rangers hockey game to pay tribute to a retired soldier, thanking him for protecting Williams and his camera crew in Iraq in 2003 after the helicopter he was riding in was forced down by enemy fire.</p> \n<p>That would be a charming tribute, if it weren't for one problem: it's false. Williams wasn't fired on in Iraq.</p> \n<p>Williams has apologized on the air, but the story hasn't gone away. On February 7, Williams <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/02/07/brian-williams-leave_n_6637072.html?ncid=tweetlnkushpmg00000067"" target=""_blank"">announced</a> in a press release that he would take a brief absence from anchoring NBC Nightly News. Here's what really happened, the false story that Williams told and then recanted, and why it matters.</p> \n<h3>What actually happened</h3> \n<p>In 2003, Williams was in <a href=""http://www.stripes.com/news/us/nbc-s-brian-williams-recants-iraq-story-after-soldiers-protest-1.327792"" target=""_blank"">Iraq</a> <span>to cover the US invasion. He and his camera crew were riding in a Chinook helicopter across the desert. Another group of three Chinooks were flying in formation about an hour ahead of them, and one of those helicopters was hit by an RPG and forced down. The other two Chinooks in the formation also made emergency landings. When Williams' helicopter caught up with the others, it landed as well. </span></p> \n<p>It is not clear whether Williams' Chinook landed because the others had already made emergency landings, or because a sandstorm was rolling in. However, the sandstorm did arrive, which meant that all four helicopters, their pilots and crews, and the NBC News staffers were all stuck in the desert for several days.</p> \n<p>But the main thing to know here is that everyone — including Brian Williams — agrees that his helicopter did not get hit by enemy fire. That did not happen.</p> \n<h3><span>Williams told a false story several times</span></h3> \n<p><span></span></p> \n<p>But Williams has <i>said</i> that his helicopter was hit by enemy fire — on several occasions.</p> \n<p>During his tribute speech on January 30, Williams <a href=""http://www.stripes.com/news/us/nbc-s-brian-williams-recants-iraq-story-after-soldiers-protest-1.327792"" target=""_blank"">said</a>, ""The story actually started with a terrible moment a dozen years back during the invasion of Iraq when the helicopter we were traveling in was forced down after being hit by an RPG.""</p> \n<p>He went on to claim, ""Our traveling NBC News team was rescued, surrounded and kept alive by an armor mechanized platoon from the US Army 3rd Infantry.""</p> \n<p>During a March 2013 <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xS3NAwZ4hGk#t=240"">appearance</a> on David Letterman, Williams said that ""two of our four helicopters were hit by ground-fire, including the one I was in, RPG and AK-47.""</p> \n<p>A few weeks earlier, Williams had told a similar tale during an appearance on Alec Baldwin's WNYC podcast ""<a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.wnyc.org/story/271534-brian-williams/"">Here's the Thing</a>."" Williams said that his ""unbridled confidence"" occasionally got him into trouble. ""I've done some ridiculously stupid things under that banner, like being in a helicopter I had no business being in in Iraq, with rounds coming into the airframe."" Baldwin asked Williams if he had thought he was going to die, and he replied ""Briefly. Sure.""</p> \n<h3>How the story grew over time</h3> \n<p>Williams hasn't always told that version of the story. In a March 2003 <a href=""http://money.cnn.com/2015/02/05/media/brian-williams-iraq-timeline/"" target=""_blank"">report</a> for NBC News, he said that he hadn't learned about the attack on the other helicopter until after his Chinook had landed. ""On the ground, we learn the Chinook ahead of us was almost blown out of the sky.""</p> \n<p>Over the years that followed, however, the story evolved to become more dramatic. In 2005, Williams told <a href=""http://money.cnn.com/2015/02/05/media/brian-williams-iraq-timeline/"" target=""_blank"">Tim Russert</a> that ""the helicopter in front of us was hit. A pickup truck stopped on the road, pulled a tarp back; a guy got up, fired an RPG, rocket-propelled grenade. These were farmers, or so they seemed. And it beautifully pierced the tail rotor of the Chinook in front of us."" <span>Williams didn't claim to have seen that happen, but he spoke in the vivid language of a firsthand account.</span></p> \n<p>In a 2007 <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://dailynightly.nbcnews.com/_news/2007/09/27/4372931-the-long-gray-line"">blog post</a>, Williams told an even more detailed story of the attack on the helicopter:</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>""Not long after Wayne's warning, some men on the ground fired an RPG through the tail rotor of the chopper flying in front of ours. There was small arms fire. A chopper pilot took a bullet through the earlobe. All four choppers dropped their heavy loads and landed quickly and hard on the desert floor.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Again, Williams didn't actually claim to have been in the helicopter that was hit. But he did describe the incident in a way that condensed the timeline, saying that ""all four"" choppers landed quickly and hard, without mentioning that the first three had landed long before his. (It is worth noting that Williams may not have known how far behind the other helicopters he was, given that he could not see them.) In other words, the story had evolved again, and in a way that placed Williams closer to the attack.</p> \n<p>Then, in a 2008 <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://dailynightly.nbcnews.com/_news/2008/05/12/4372071-prior-associations"">blog post</a>, Williams made the shift to actually claiming that his helicopter was fired upon:</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>The Chinook helicopter flying in front of ours (from the 101st Airborne) took an RPG to the rear rotor, as all four of our low-flying Chinooks took fire. We were forced down and stayed down — for the better (or worse) part of 3 days and 2 nights.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<h3>Williams has now recanted the story and apologized</h3> \n<p><iframe frameborder=""0"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/sW6AbX2q0fM"" height=""720"" width=""1280""></iframe></p> \n<p>Several veterans told the military newspaper <a href=""http://www.stripes.com/news/us/nbc-s-brian-williams-recants-iraq-story-after-soldiers-protest-1.327792"" target=""_blank"" style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.65;"">Stars and Stripes</a> that Williams' account was wrong. On Tuesday, the newspaper <span>reported that his version of events was fake. Speaking to the paper for their story, </span><span>Williams made the first of several apologies acknowledging the story was false.</span></p> \n<p>""I would not have chosen to make this mistake,"" Williams told the paper. ""I don't know what screwed up in my mind that caused me to conflate one aircraft with another.""</p> \n<p>Williams also apologized on Facebook, saying that he felt ""terrible"" about the mistake, and that ""I think the constant viewing of the video showing us inspecting the impact area — and the fog of memory over 12 years — made me conflate the two.""</p> \n<p>He also apologized live on air on NBC, as shown in the video clip above.</p> \n<h3>Williams continues to face criticism despite his apologies</h3> \n<p>Williams' multiple apologies did not make this story go away.</p> \n<p>That's partly because his fake anecdotes made it seem like he was trying to claim the bravery of other people who really did come under fire. After all, one of the Chinooks <i>did</i> get hit by an RPG. The story Williams told was theirs, not his.</p> \n<p>Lance Reynolds, who was the flight engineer on the helicopter that got hit with the RPG, told Stars and Stripes, ""It was something personal for us that was kind of life-changing for me. I know how lucky I was to survive it."" For Reynolds, the incident was ""a personal experience that someone else wanted to participate in and didn't deserve to participate in.""</p> \n<p>And several commentators have said that Williams' falsehoods call his journalistic credibility into question. For instance, the <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/wp/2015/02/05/the-brian-williams-scandal-is-an-nbc-news-wide-scandal/"" target=""_blank"">Washington Post's</a> Erik Wemple called the incident an ""NBC News-wide scandal,"" and asked why it took pushback from veterans to reveal the problem. ""Do these folks have to fight our wars and fact-check NBC News?""<span> And CNN's </span><a style=""font-size: 1.15em; line-height: 1.65; background-color: #ffffff;"" href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/02/05/brian-williams-helicopter-apology-news-anchors-react_n_6622238.html"" target=""_blank"">Chris Cuomo</a><span> said that ""Memory is either right or it is wrong and we are in the business of being right.""</span></p> \n<p>As the criticism built, Williams apparently believed he had little choice but to step back temporarily from anchoring NBC Nightly News. He announced in a <a href=""http://press.nbcnews.com/2015/02/07/a-personal-note-from-brian-williams/"" target=""_blank"">February 7 press release</a>, ""I have decided to take myself off of my daily broadcast for the next several days, and Lester Holt has kindly agreed to sit in for me to allow us to adequately deal with this issue. Upon my return, I will continue my career-long effort to be worthy of the trust of those who place their trust in us.""</p> \n<p><b>WATCH: 'Why recording the police is so important'</b></p> \n<p><!-- CHORUS_VIDEO_EMBED ChorusVideo:56758 --></p>",Television

TV has been readying Americans for a Hillary Clinton presidency for a decade,http://www.vox.com/2015/4/15/8418047/hillary-clinton-tv-president,Fictional female politicians on shows as diverse as Parks & Recreation and 24 have seemed to be in conversation with Clinton.,"<p>When <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/4/12/8393449/hillary-2016-announcement-video"">Hillary Clinton announced</a> (for the second time) her candidacy for the presidency, she joined a lengthy line of predecessors, other women who had heard her call and stepped into public service, sometimes attaining the highest office in the land.</p> \n<p>Of course, that's not what happened in our reality. But it <em>was</em> what happened in pop culture, where the US often workshops and tries out ideas that will eventually become reality. The growing rise of gay rights in the country, for instance, <a href=""http://www.out.com/out-exclusives/out-20/2012/10/24/ultimate-gay-tv-timeline"">neatly tracks with</a> the growing depiction of gay people as fellow American citizens on television, and fiction has a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_president_in_popular_culture_%28United_States%29"">long history of black presidents</a> preceding Barack Obama's election.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""center"">Television has been preparing Americans for a second Clinton presidency, sometimes unknowingly</q></p> \n<p>Yet, weirdly, female presidents are a somewhat rare commodity in American fiction, only really coming into their own in the last 10 years and mostly doing so on television. And if you look at these characters, you'll see something interesting — they're all actively in conversation with Hillary Clinton, on one level or another.</p> \n<p>Television, especially, has been preparing Americans for a second Clinton presidency, sometimes unknowingly.</p> \n<h3>The stealth candidacy for a Hillary Clinton presidency — in 2005</h3> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3606834/geena.0.jpg"" data-caption=""Geena Davis was one of TV's earliest fictional Hillary Clinton analogues, in her role on the ABC show Commander in Chief."" data-chorus-asset-id=""3606834""></p> \n<p>Any history of TV Hillary Clinton analogues who actually become president must begin with <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000133/?ref_=nv_sr_1"">Geena Davis</a>'s role in <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0429455/?ref_=nv_sr_1""><em>Commander in Chief</em></a>, a 2005 ABC political drama about the first female president that was very briefly a huge hit. The first five episodes crested 15 million viewers, before production troubles and a change in producers caused the show to leave the air for several months, which halted any momentum it had built up. The series was canceled after one season.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""left"">""This is not a You-Go-Hillary Show, this is a You-Go-Girl show""</q></p> \n<p>Early in the run, though, when the series looked like TV's next big hit, series creator <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0527109/?ref_=nv_sr_1"">Rod Lurie</a> and Davis herself were asked, repeatedly, if the show was a shadow campaign for a Hillary Clinton run in 2008. Republican bloggers and talking heads went so far as to suggest that the show was overt propaganda for such a thing, despite the fact that President Mackenzie Allen (Davis) is an independent who only becomes president after the one she plays vice president to dies.</p> \n<p>""This is not a You-Go-Hillary show, this is a You-Go-Girl show,"" <a href=""http://www.today.com/id/9664425/ns/today-today_entertainment/t/geena-davis-hillary-clinton-stand-in/#.VQT_mI54pjk"">Lurie told the Associated Press</a> shortly after the show debuted. ""I just want to see women in the process, whether they be Democrats or Republicans or Independents. If there’s any social agenda to the show, it’s to be enthusiastic about the idea of a woman president — and an Independent president. She’s an Independent, which is sort of a big deal.""</p> \n<p>Mackenzie, then, is best read as part of Hollywood's attempts to come up with a new <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0200276/?ref_=nv_sr_1""><em>West Wing</em></a> in a world where Republicans controlled both the presidency and the Congress. And as with many fictional women, Mackenzie was portrayed as an accidental president, ascending to the throne when a man dies or is removed from office. Her Clinton overlap is actually rather minimal — they're both women, and they both have considerable numbers of political opponents — but just the idea of a woman president was enough.</p> \n<p>The fictional Hillary Clintons were on their way.</p> \n<h3>The Clinton-ish characters</h3> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3606832/composite.0.jpg"" data-caption=""TV's many other fictional Hillary Clinton figures have included on, from left, Madam Secretary (played by Téa Leoni), Scandal (Bellamy Young), Veep (Julia Louis-Dreyfus), and Parks &amp; Recreation (Amy Poehler)."" data-chorus-asset-id=""3606832""></p> \n<p>After Clinton lost the Democratic nomination for president in 2008 and settled into a role as Obama's secretary of state, the raw elements of her story — ambitious former first lady who came agonizingly close to the presidency herself before falling <em>just</em> short — proved irresistible to the TV industry, which used them over and over again. And yet these shows tended to paint their heroines as either unlikely political success stories (as with Mackenzie Allen) or as frustrated strivers, stuck in go-nowhere jobs.</p> \n<p>Take, for instance, Elizabeth McCord, the character <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000495/?ref_=nv_sr_1"">Téa Leoni</a> plays currently on CBS's respectably rated <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3501074/?ref_=nv_sr_1""><em>Madam Secretary</em></a>. (The show has already been renewed for a second season.) As secretary of state, Elizabeth is asked to handle all manner of foreign crises, in the usual, dogged ""case of the week"" structure of a CBS show that primarily appeals to an older audience. But she's also a former CIA employee who has no real desire to get back into politics — which is exactly why the president (her former boss) asks her to do the job. Elizabeth is clearly meant to resonate with Clinton's well-respected time at the State Department, and she's far from the ambitious figure Clinton is usually painted as.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""center"">These shows tended to paint their heroines as either unlikely political success stories or as frustrated strivers</q></p> \n<p>Similarly, consider Mellie Grant (<a href=""http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0949292/?ref_=nv_sr_1"">Bellamy Young</a>) on <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1837576/?ref_=nm_knf_t2""><em>Scandal</em></a>, super-producer <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0722274/?ref_=tt_ov_wr"">Shonda Rhimes</a>'s fantasia on American politics as operatic melodrama. A major theme of recent episodes has been that Mellie, the first lady, longs to be president after her husband leaves the office, despite having no obvious qualifications. Mellie is one of <em>Scandal</em>'s best characters, a frustrated political wife beset on all sides by her husband's infidelity and her own demons, but in this instance, she plays uneasily into late-'90s fears that Clinton was simply using her husband's coattails to propel her own political career.</p> \n<p>It's also worth looking to two women who manage to actually become president — though we've seen little of their administrations. On <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1759761/?ref_=nv_sr_1""><em>Veep</em></a>, <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000506/?ref_=tt_ov_st"">Julia Louis-Dreyfus</a>'s hysterical take on Vice President Selina Meyer, for instance, only gained in depth the closer she got to holding actual power. Her Clinton-ish character is often a buffoon, yes, but one who keys into the central arc of Clinton's 2008 campaign. The closer Selina gets to what she wants, the further away it is, something that paradoxically continues to hold true now that she's president as the fourth season begins.</p> \n<p>As far as <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0688132/?ref_=nv_sr_1"">Amy Poehler</a>'s Leslie Knope on <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1266020/?ref_=nm_knf_i1""><em>Parks &amp; Recreation</em></a> goes, it's impossible to say if she actually became president in the show's series finale, but it seems likely either she or her husband did. Yet the show's portrayal of Leslie as a small-town can-do optimist, beset on all sides by people who were angry with essentially everything she did, originally resonated deeply with Clinton. (When the show began in 2009, the 2008 campaign was fresher in memory.) But it also came to resonate with the anger that eventually greeted President Obama.</p> \n<p>All four of these characters presented different faces of the Clinton Americans think they know. They were — directly and indirectly — feeding into the larger story of the woman who would have been president and ultimately wasn't — but might get a second chance someday.</p> \n<p>And speaking of Poehler ...</p> \n<h3>The actual Hillary Clintons</h3> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3606838/amy.0.jpg"" data-caption=""Amy Poehler's Saturday Night Live portrayal of then Senator Hillary Clinton quickly became legendary."" data-chorus-asset-id=""3606838""></p> \n<p>The frequent comparisons between Leslie and Clinton early in the run of <em>Parks</em> may have had something to do with the fact that Poehler spent the 2008 campaign playing the then-senator on <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0072562/?ref_=nv_sr_1""><em>Saturday Night Live</em></a>. She has been succeeded by <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0571952/?ref_=nv_sr_1"">Kate McKinnon</a> in the same ""role,"" as the 2016 campaign heats up.</p> \n<p>Poehler and McKinnon have subtly different takes on Clinton, but one thing that unites them is a frustration with having to play the political game. Poehler's Clinton, in particular, took on a certain level of increasingly horrified irritation that something she had wanted so very badly wasn't going to be hers.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""right"">It's telling that SNL never quite figured out how to lampoon Obama but always had a good sense of what to do with Clinton</q></p> \n<p>Both ""characters"" are the sorts of ambitious, striving, slightly unhinged women that Clinton is often caricatured as. But they also both succeed as among the best impersonations of recent <em>SNL</em> because they get at the heart of this story, the idea of wanting something that stays, nevertheless, just out of reach, and all of the needless bullshit that goes with such a thing.</p> \n<p>It's perhaps telling that <em>SNL</em> never quite figured out how to lampoon Obama, but always had a good sense of what to do with Clinton. That may have something to with stereotypes of ambitious women in comedic contexts being more societally acceptable, or it might have something to do with Clinton having more obvious personal tics to satirize.</p> \n<p>But watch these two riffs on Clinton sometime and you'll see a constant, boiling frustration lying underneath the surface. ""This,"" they seem to ask, ""is what I have to do to be <em>president</em>?""</p> \n<h3>The best fictional Hillary Clinton of all time</h3> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3606836/cherry2.0.jpg"" data-caption=""Cherry Jones' portrayal of President Allison Taylor on 24 made for the finest fictional Hillary Clinton."" data-chorus-asset-id=""3606836""></p> \n<p>Weirdly, the best TV Clinton was probably President Allison Taylor (<a href=""http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0427728/?ref_=nv_sr_3"">Cherry Jones</a>), who was the final fictional president on the original run of action series <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0285331/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_8""><em>24</em></a>.</p> \n<p>Jones was hired to play the part in 2007 for the show's seventh season, which seemed as if it would air in early 2008 and coincide with Clinton's presidential campaign. Instead, the 2007 writers strike delayed the season to early 2009 — when Obama was about to take office and Jones was forced to answer <a href=""http://content.usatoday.com/communities/entertainment/post/2009/02/62759009/1#.VS3TBpR4pIA"">endless questions</a> about whether her character was meant to be a Clinton analogue.</p> \n<p>I say ""weirdly"" because <em>24</em> was roundly read as a politically conservative show. It was often seen as supporting America's use of torture and the Bush Doctrine. (These critiques often missed how the true villains on the show were usually American business interests.) Thus, Allison Taylor became sort of the inverse of Mackenzie Allen. Instead of an attempt to create a fictional Democratic president in a Republican world, Allison is a fictional Republican president for a Democratic world.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""center"">Allison is a fictional Republican president for a Democratic world</q></p> \n<p>Though Allison's party is never identified, she's interventionist in foreign policy in a way that tracks with prior <em>24</em> commanders in chief and the real-life George W. Bush. She just feels a little bit more agony about it than many others. Her America is also one constantly beset by terrorist attacks and violent threats of overthrow. At one point, her White House is even invaded by a terrorist militia.</p> \n<p>And yet Allison Taylor becomes perhaps the best argument for a female president TV has yet cooked up. She appears to have won her election convincingly, rather than ascending to the office via means other than the voters (as with every other fictional president on this list, save maybe Leslie Knope). She's politically savvy and doesn't appear to be any worse at navigating the treacherous waters of foreign policy in the <em>24 </em>universe than any of her predecessors.</p> \n<p>When you consider that her predecessors included an <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Logan_%2824_character%29""><em>actual traitor</em></a>, you could even make the argument that Allison is the best <em>24</em> president of them all. Only David Palmer (<a href=""http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0371660/?ref_=nv_sr_1"">Dennis Haysbert</a>), the <em>24</em> universe's first black president, comes close.</p> \n<p>Jones <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxkc2vacpD4"">won an Emmy</a> for the role, even though <em>24</em> itself had seen better days, and it's easy to see why. Her take on the role was that of a woman beset on all sides by angry tempests but facing them down with steely resolve and an iron will. She was, in other words, a somewhat perfect fantasy for Hollywood in the early days of the Obama administration, when it became clear he would not be able to enact his agenda by sheer force of will.</p> \n<p>Allison Taylor is only accidentally a Hillary Clinton analogue, but she ends up being the best by sheer virtue of how much she gets done. She was a fictional do-over, a chance to toss someone Clinton-esque into the role of president and see what happened. And in her own way, she may have paved the way for any Clinton presidency that results better than any other fictional figure.</p>",Television

Though billed as a Netflix Original, the show was actually first broadcast on Britain’s Channel 4 in late 2014.</p> \n<p>The show centers on Dylan (Johnny Flynn), a towheaded 20-something who just learned he has contracted chlamydia and must contact all of his former lovers to break the news. Each episode tells the story of Dylan’s relationship with a different partner and is named after the woman in question. The twist: rather than going through the list chronologically, as most people would probably do, Dylan decides to go in alphabetical order, allowing the show to jump around in time, instead of giving us a straightforward biography of Dylan’s romantic history.</p> \n<p>The other main characters include Dylan’s roommate, obligatory walking-id bro Luke (Daniel Ings); and Dylan’s best friend Evie (Antonia Thomas), Dylan and Luke’s former roommate and Dylan’s dream girl.</p> \n<h3>Why is that title so familiar to me?</h3> \n<p>Probably because Netflix decided to put some muscle behind marketing it. You might be one of the people who received an email from Netflix in mid-April pushing the show, or maybe it popped up in the ""recommended"" box on the streaming site.</p> \n<p> </p> \n<blockquote class=""twitter-tweet""> \n<p dir=""ltr"" lang=""en"">Why does <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/Netflix?src=hash"">#Netflix</a> think I would want to watch something called ""Scrotal Recall."" <a href=""http://t.co/JAJrfzvTV8"">pic.twitter.com/JAJrfzvTV8</a></p> \n— Brian Bailey (@Indie88Brian) <a href=""https://twitter.com/Indie88Brian/status/596094273612697600"">May 6, 2015</a>\n</blockquote> \n<p> </p> \n<blockquote class=""twitter-tweet""> \n<p dir=""ltr"" lang=""und"">Why, <a href=""https://twitter.com/netflix"">@netflix</a> ? <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/scrotalrecall?src=hash"">#scrotalrecall</a> <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/punny?src=hash"">#punny</a> <a href=""http://t.co/WTVsGlkEmO"">pic.twitter.com/WTVsGlkEmO</a></p> \n— Kim (@kimisnotamused) <a href=""https://twitter.com/kimisnotamused/status/588442684689256448"">April 15, 2015</a>\n</blockquote> \n<p> </p> \n<p> \n<script charset=""utf-8"" src=""//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js""></script> \n</p> \n<p>You might have even seen people complaining about said marketing campaign on Twitter.</p> \n<p> </p> \n<blockquote class=""twitter-tweet""> \n<p dir=""ltr"" lang=""en"">Not only am I not interested, Netflix, I’m actively angry at being recommended something called ‘Scrotal Recall’.</p> \n— Phineas (@Phineas) <a href=""https://twitter.com/Phineas/status/590313792220725248"">April 21, 2015</a>\n</blockquote> \n<p> </p> \n<p> \n<script charset=""utf-8"" src=""//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js""></script> \n</p> \n<p> </p> \n<blockquote class=""twitter-tweet""> \n<p dir=""ltr"" lang=""en"">Scrotal Recall - Netflix show, or punchline to a joke told by a standup comedian at an open mic in 1992</p> \n— Antoine Linguine (@aklingus) <a href=""https://twitter.com/aklingus/status/589945272064606208"">April 20, 2015</a>\n</blockquote> \n<p> </p> \n<p> \n<script charset=""utf-8"" src=""//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js""></script> \n</p> \n<p> </p> \n<blockquote class=""twitter-tweet""> \n<p dir=""ltr"" lang=""en"">Uhhh <a href=""https://twitter.com/netflix"">@Netflix</a>?

The characters are certainly sex-focused — as 20-something characters in a sitcom about dating are wont to be — and there's the whole STD thing. But this is definitely more of a rom-com than a Showtime-esque skinfest.</p> \n<p>There’s a shot of male buttocks in the pilot, as well as a minor plot runner involving a finger in an unexpected place, but overall things stay relatively PG-13. Still, you probably don't want to watch it with any kids, lest you find yourself having to attempt to explain what <a href=""http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Turkish+Mudflaps"">""Dutch mudflaps""</a> are.</p> \n<h3>Is this like some shows I've already seen?</h3> \n<p>Sort of! While the ""getting in touch with your exes"" conceit has a whiff of <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0146882/?ref_=nv_sr_1""><em>High Fidelity</em></a> about it, <em>Scrotal Recall</em> is more reminiscent of <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0460649/?ref_=nv_sr_1""><em>How I Met Your Mother</em></a>. The two shows share plenty of DNA, most notably in their complicated flashback structures and their moony protagonists, perpetually in search of The One. Like <em>HIMYM</em>’s Ted Mosby, Dylan has a slightly goofy, hangdog charm, though he lacks the pompousness that made Ted so frequently irritating (as well as Ted’s obsession with settling down and having babies).</p> \n<p>By that equation, Luke is the Barney Stinson stand-in, though where even Neil Patrick Harris’s ineffable charms were not enough to disguise the fact that Barney was basically a sociopath, Daniel Ings brings a vulnerability and genuine sense of caring to his character that displays the beating, (somewhat) morally conscious heart underneath the open-collared polo shirt.</p> \n<h3>What about women characters?</h3> \n<p>This is where the show disappoints. Many of the women on the show are more like sketches, anchored by a single defining trait: the older pragmatist, the controlling wife, the commitment-phobic sex fiend.</p> \n<p>Even the female lead, Evie, is not quite as clearly drawn as her male counterparts — beyond ""photographer"" (too-easy character shorthand for ""artistic"") and ""secretly into Dylan,"" we don't know a huge amount about what makes her tick. Still, as played by Antonia Thomas, she has spark, a real sense of fun, and an easy chemistry with Flynn that makes their characters' pining for each other pleasant to watch — if not totally believable.</p> \n<h3>But is it good?</h3> \n<p>Yes! It probably will not change your outlook on life, but if you're a fan of millennial-focused romantic comedies and good-looking people from the United Kingdom, go ahead and give this a shot. It's mostly light and frequently funny, and it deals with scenarios that will feel at least a bit familiar to anyone who's spent any time swimming (or drowning) in the dating pool.</p> \n<p>Perhaps the strongest element is how the show cleverly uses its complicated timeline to play around with characters’ relationships and subvert expectations. Where <em>HIMYM</em> occasionally (especially in later seasons) seemed to lean on its flashbacks and flash-forwards as a gimmick or brain-teaser for especially focused fans, <em>Recall</em> instead uses it to show how the characters’ relationships to one another have changed over time.</p> \n<p>On the obvious level, Dylan catching up with his exes gives him plenty of opportunity to reexamine his life and his choices; but as the audience watches the events unfold in the past and present, what was once played for laughs becomes more poignant, as we catch up to the characters’ realizations of what’s passed them by.</p> \n<p>Also there are only six episodes in the first season, so it's not a huge time commitment.</p> \n<h3>Should <em>Scrotal Recall</em> be used as a model for how to tell former lovers about an STD in real life? Asking for a friend.</h3> \n<p>Vox does not recommend that in any way. But best of luck to your friend!</p> \n<p><i>The first season of </i>Scrotal Recall<i> is </i><a href=""http://www.netflix.com/WiMovie/80041601"" target=""_blank""><i>streaming on Netflix</i></a><i>.

"Cable news is in trouble, and itâ€™s more about the news than the cable",http://www.vox.com/2015/5/10/8578041/cable-news-ratings-2015,Relative peace and stability are bad news for cable news.,"<p>Cable news is in trouble. The Pew Research Center <a href=""http://www.journalism.org/2015/04/29/cable-news-fact-sheet/"">reports</a> that the median daily audience for Fox, CNN, and MSNBC is down about 11 percent since 2008.</p> \n<p>The Washington Post's Paul Farhi sees <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/as-viewers-drift-is-it-past-prime-time-for-the-cable-news-networks/2015/05/06/6dbba2bc-eeb6-11e4-a55f-38924fca94f9_story.html"" target=""_blank"">a grim future</a> for the industry. He argues that cable news outlets are pretty much where newspapers were a decade ago: their audience is aging, their medium is being disrupted by new technologies, and the next generation of viewers is developing habits and preferences that they're poorly placed to serve. (This is probably a good moment to note that I'm a contributor to MSNBC.)</p> \n<p>The networks may still be making money — in 2014, Fox News managed $1.2 billion in profits, while CNN cleared $300 million and MSNBC made a bit more than $200 million — but Farhi suggests ""the cable news networks will face bankruptcy the same way Ernest Hemingway once described a character’s financial demise: 'Gradually and then suddenly.'""</p> \n<p>Perhaps that's right. But while Farhi's account of cable news outlets' woes focuses mainly on the cable part of the equation, it's also worth considering the problems all three networks are having with the news itself.</p> \n<h3>The rise of cable news had a lot to do with news</h3> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""3681464"">\n<img src=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3681464/primetotallarge.jpg""> \n<div class=""caption""> \n<p>The rise of cable news, or at least Fox and MSNBC, in one chart.</p> \n</div> \n</div> \n<p>The rise of the three major cable news networks were all driven by stories they dominated. CNN was made by the 1991 Gulf War. It wasn't just the first time it passed the networks in ratings; it was the first time CNN showed that it could beat the networks in coverage. You can still feel the surprise in this <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/1991/01/17/business/the-media-business-cnn-takes-an-early-lead-in-coverage-of-the-gulf-war.html"">New York Times article</a> from 1991:</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>The shooting in the Persian Gulf began tonight with the three broadcast networks committed to covering the war on a 24-hour basis, although their image as news leaders was damaged by the Cable News Network's early dominance of the coverage ... he networks' image was certainly not helped when Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said he was following the attacks on Baghdad on CNN. At least one network station, an NBC station in Detroit, decided to quit its network's coverage to run CNN's. And NBC finally was compelled to interview CNN reporters on the air to get information out of Baghdad.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Fox News, for its part, saw basically exponential growth around 9/11, and then again around the 2008 campaign and Obama's election. MSNBC's rise was driven by the backlash to the Bush administration, and particularly to the Iraq War:</p> \n<p><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/pdD6op0l2jk"" frameborder=""0"" height=""480"" width=""640""></iframe></p> \n<p>The network held those gains in the first half of the Obama era, as liberals went from terrified to triumphant. But as liberals have gone from triumphant to a bit depressed and checked out, viewership has begun to decline.</p> \n<h3>The fall of cable news has a lot to do with news</h3> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""3683510"" alt=""cable news ratings"" src=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3683510/Screen_Shot_2015-05-09_at_3.17.41_PM.0.png""></p> \n<p class=""caption""><a href=""http://www.journalism.org/2015/04/29/state-of-the-news-media-2015/"">Pew's 2015 State of the Media report.</a></p> \n<p><span>The recent rise of cable news — particularly Fox and MSNBC — came in a period when the news — particularly political news — was unusually interesting.</span></p> \n<p>Between 2000 and 2012, we saw a contested US presidential election, the largest terrorist attack ever on US soil, wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, repeated wave elections, a global financial crisis, the first black president, the rise of the Tea Party, the fight over Obamacare, and the first states to legalize gay marriage and marijuana — and much more. It's been a weirdly interesting, consequential period in American politics. And so the cable news networks, which could devote 24 hours a day to covering these stories, benefited.</p> \n<p>But now it's an unusually dull period in American politics. Congress is gridlocked, and is likely to stay that way for the foreseeable future. The US, thankfully, isn't reeling from a terrorist attack or a financial crisis. We haven't invaded Iran, at least not yet. And it's not just cable news that's losing viewers because of it. Turnout in <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2014/11/10/voter-turnout-in-2014-was-the-lowest-since-wwii/"">the 2014 election</a> was the lowest it's been in 70 years.</p> \n<p>You see this, I think, in the specific fortunes of the cable networks. Farhi reports that MSNBC lost 14 percent of its audience in 2014, and Fox lost 2 percent. But CNN prime time — which swung away from politics toward covering plane crashes and airing documentaries — is up 10 percent in 2015.</p> \n<p>Which is all to say that Farhi may be right about the long-term decline of cable news — over some extended period of time, both network and cable channels are going to be diminished by whatever it is the internet creates in their place.</p> \n<p>But year to year, a lot of the ups and downs might just be the appeal of what's actually in the news. If President Scott Walker goes to war with Iran, MSNBC's ratings are going to go up. If President Hillary Clinton takes away everyone's guns, Fox is going to boom. But for now, relative peace and stability are bad news for cable news.</p>",Television
"The fight over George Stephanopoulos giving $75,000 to the Clinton Foundation, explained",http://www.vox.com/2015/5/14/8607613/george-stephanopoulos-clinton-foundation,The anchor once worked in the Clinton White House â€” but wrote a tell-all book that infuriated the Clintons.,"<ol> \n<li>George Stephanopoulos of ABC donated $75,000 to the Clinton Foundation between 2012 and 2014, according to <a href=""http://www.politico.com/blogs/media/2015/05/george-stephanopoulos-discloses-contribution-to-clinton-207120.html"">a report by Politico's Dylan Byers</a>.</li> \n<li>Stephanopoulos has covered Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign and various controversies over the Clinton Foundation on air without disclosing those donations.</li> \n<li>In a statement, Stephanopoulos said that the donations were for ""global AIDS prevention and deforestation, causes I care about deeply,"" but apologized for not previously disclosing them. ABC News is also standing by Stephanopoulos, <a href=""http://www.politico.com/blogs/media/2015/05/george-stephanopoulos-discloses-contribution-to-clinton-207120.html"">Byers says</a>.</li> \n<li>Stephanopoulos has a long and complicated history with the Clintons that includes working in the Clinton White House, but subsequently writing a tell-all book that infuriated the administration.</li> \n</ol> \n<h3>How Stephanopoulos went from a Democratic aide to a news anchor</h3> \n<p>George Stephanopoulos has an odd career track for a news anchor on a mainstream network — because he started his career in the world of Democratic politics. Working as an aide in the House of Representatives and on campaigns, he had a meteoric rise. He became Bill Clinton's first White House communications director at the age of 31.</p> \n<p>But after Clinton's first term, Stephanopoulos left the White House, where he had fallen into disfavor (in part because the Clintons thought him a source of leaks to the media) and began to build a new career for himself, as a media commentator. He was soon hired by ABC News — and at first he was viewed as a reliably liberal, pro-Clinton voice.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""center"">""as far as Clinton was concerned, I was now a nonperson""</q></p> \n<p>But after the Monica Lewinsky scandal arose, Stephanopoulos was notably reluctant to stick up for Clinton on the air. ""I couldn't bring myself to say I believed him,"" Stephanopoulos wrote in his memoir <em><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/All-too-Human-George-Stephanopoulos/dp/0316930164"">All Too Human</a></em>. ""I couldn't buy the party line."" Eventually, he heard from old colleagues that ""as far as Clinton was concerned, I was now a nonperson — my name was not to be mentioned in his presence."" He continues: ""I was the enemy now.""</p> \n<p>Indeed, his autobiography ends with a brutal line where Stephanopoulos wonders ""what might have been — if only this good president had been a better man."" That 1999 book, which reveals numerous behind-the-scenes interactions from the White House, only <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/clinton/stories/clinton030899.htm"">infuriated the Clintons further</a>.</p> \n<p>The controversy helped establish Stephanopoulos as a more nonpartisan voice. And when the network concluded that a lot of people really liked looking at and listening to him, he was elevated to higher and higher positions. He moved from a commentator to the host of ABC's Sunday morning show <em>This Week</em> in 2002, became a co-anchor of <em>Good Morning America</em> in 2009, and finally rose to chief anchor at ABC News in 2014.</p> \n<p>Overall, Stephanopoulos has completed a transition from partisan politics to a high-level mainstream news job that hardly anyone else has managed. Bill Moyers is probably the closest comparison, but Stephanopoulos is viewed as less ideological, and his influence, through <i>Good Morning America</i>, has been more mainstream.</p> \n<p>His donations to the Clinton Foundation, however, might imperil his hard-won reputation for fairness.</p> \n<h3>If Donald Trump can donate to the Clinton Foundation, why can't Stephanopoulos?</h3> \n<p>The argument in Stephanopoulos's defense here is that the Clinton Foundation is a charity, so donations to it shouldn't be interpreted as partisan. As Stephanopoulos said in his statement, his contributions related to ""AIDS prevention and deforestation."" Also, the argument goes, if <a href=""http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/242088-trump-gave-at-least-100k-to-clinton-foundation"">conservatives like Donald Trump</a> have donated money to the foundation, how could donations be interpreted as partisan?</p> \n<p>On the disclosure question, anonymous sources<a href=""http://www.politico.com/blogs/media/2015/05/george-stephanopoulos-discloses-contribution-to-clinton-207120.html""> told Byers</a> that Stephanopoulos ""gives to dozens of charities every year, and that the total sum of these annual contributions is in the millions of dollars."" The implication is that these donations, being a small part of his overall giving, slipped through the cracks.</p> \n<p>Still, mainstream reporters were, overall, quite disapproving when the news broke:</p> \n<p> </p> \n<blockquote lang=""en"" class=""twitter-tweet""> \n<p dir=""ltr"" lang=""en"">Stephanopoulos donated $50k to Clinton Foundation.

""It's like he thinks the Clinton Foundation is the only outlet doing charitable work overseas,"" <a href=""https://twitter.com/reidepstein/status/598844095713280002"">Reid Epstein of the Wall Street Journal tweeted</a>.</p> \n<p>Furthermore, various controversies over the foundation have been important news stories this year. ""It's not just that he donated money, Stephanopoulos concluded on air that ABC News found no impropriety with foundation financials,"" <a href=""https://twitter.com/redsteeze/status/598851562597912577"">tweeted Stephen Miller</a>.

The faintest rumor about Netflix's growing empire could shake how investors might place big future bets, but even analysts <a href=""http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2015/05/27/2014-2015-season-nbc-leads-among-adults-18-49-cbs-tops-total-viewers-through-week-35-ending-may-24-2015/408501/"">admit</a> Nielsen ratings and Netflix viewing hours are incomparable.</p> \n<p>The prediction hints at a bigger problem than it may seem: We can't say if Netflix is surpassing network audiences because <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/5/27/8665471/future-of-tv-network"">we don't know how to define television</a>. Here's why.</p> \n<h3>The way the TV industry thinks about its product is outdated</h3> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""3825340"" alt=""shutterstock_283142336.0.jpg"" src=""https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3825340/shutterstock_283142336.0.jpg""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Many television executives think about video monetization in terms of which screen it appears on. That's a reasonable but increasingly outdated perspective. (Shutterstock)</p> \n<p>Defining aired TV content as programmed versus streamed content was a good way for executives to define budgets — two decades ago. But ""what content goes on which screen where"" is still the method used to define content today because execs are stuck in a traditional mindset: ""Over-the-top content"" (OTT) is content you can watch that wasn't paid out of a programming exec's broadcast<strong> </strong>television budget, such as online-focused content by or from <a href=""http://recode.net/2015/06/25/ott-and-tv-will-coexist-and-it-will-be-beautiful/"">a cable network</a> like HBO or an on-demand video provider like Amazon or Netflix. This extra-meta <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.nbcdfw.com/news/tech/The-Future-of-Television-Over-the-Top-TV_Dallas-Fort-Worth-280539852.html"">NBC segment on OTT</a>, ironically funded by traditional programming, explains itself.</p> \n<p> \n<script type=""text/javascript"" charset=""UTF-8"" src=""http://www.nbcdfw.com/portableplayer/?cmsID=280539852&amp;videoID=Qb7Ae8eiqD1u&amp;origin=nbcdfw.com&amp;sec=news&amp;subsec=tech&amp;width=600&amp;height=360""></script> \n</p> \n<p>OTT is a truly terrible way to think of anything-but-television content in a world where the production of video is now in everyone's hands. Two other reasons it's awful: First, <a href=""http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-10-23/nbc-surprised-as-hbo-cbs-make-move-to-online-only-television"">content aired on TV can be OTT</a> if there is a new cost associated with distributing it elsewhere. And Netflix is a producer and distributor of OTT content as well as a distributor of a network's content. That doesn't make Netflix a television network.</p> \n<p>If you wanted to see this apples to apples, you would compare views of Netflix (original programming only) to that of network-paid original programming (everywhere). Trouble is, it's a Herculean task to track views on the Internet for networks — a problem not even Nielsen has solved. Netflix doesn't release viewership stats, but the few estimates we've seen suggest they lag behind those of the networks.</p> \n<p>So now you know why industry folks like to know how many people watched the Super Bowl. Block-specific reach and subscriber rates are still the best metric the industry has to understand audience reach — ""market power"" — in the same outdated way investors and network executives do.</p> \n<h3>We're down with OTT, and the networks know it</h3> \n<p>Licensing versus programming revenues, which have little to do with Nielsen ratings, is a different way of thinking about competition. Todd VanDerWerff perfectly <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/5/27/8665471/future-of-tv-network%20"">described the dilemma facing television</a>, which is one of imagination — not audience reach:</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>Television doesn't mean ""a box"" any more. It means ""a way of telling stories.""</p> \n<p>And if streaming services are perfectly positioned to take advantage of that shift, and cable networks are only sort of positioned to do so, then the broadcast networks are running scared by default.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>All this doesn't mean the networks can't innovate into a better position, revenue-wise — but until we have a better way of defining what TV means outside of an actual TV, we can only measure the tip of one iceberg when it's compared with the tip of another. For now, execs can talk about how we should define television, and they do. Below is a 2014 video of cable execs discussing how truly global OTT is:</p> \n<p><iframe frameborder=""0"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/J2QQjFpTc_g"" height=""315"" width=""100%""></iframe></p>",Television
The media is getting better at fact-checking climate deniers â€” but still not great,http://www.vox.com/2015/7/2/8886615/media-gop-climate-denialism,Print and online journalists are starting to factcheck the climate denialism of GOP candidates. Sometimes.,"<p>The American politico-media complex is in a bit of an awkward phase on the subject of climate change. By now, virtually everyone acknowledges it's a problem that calls for policy solutions — everyone, that is, except the <a href=""http://environment.yale.edu/climate-communication/article/not-all-republicans-think-alike-about-global-warming/"">hardcore base of the Republican Party</a> and, oh yeah, <a href=""http://grist.org/politics/meet-the-climate-deniers-who-want-to-be-president/"">all the Republican presidential candidates</a> (except, uh, <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/6/3/8722679/lindsey-graham-climate-change"">Lindsey Graham</a>).</p> \n<p>Mainstream political journalists are generally educated cosmopolitans who accept the scientific consensus. Yet their jobs regularly bring them into contact with, and require them to write about, these politicians who reject it. How should they deal with that?</p> \n<p>Back in March, I wrote <a href=""http://grist.org/climate-energy/how-american-journalists-deal-with-climate-deniers/"">a post</a> about that very subject. It keyed off media analyst Jay Rosen, who <a href=""http://pressthink.org/2015/03/journalists-have-to-decide-what-to-do-about-candidates-who-are-climate-change-denialists/"">asked</a> how campaign journalists planned to address the climate denialism of GOP presidential candidates in the 2016 race.</p> \n<p>Rosen offered four possible options:</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p> </p> \n<ol> \n<li><span>Normalize it: Treat denialist claims like any other campaign position.</span></li> \n<li><span>Savvy analysis: Is denialism a winning move or is it costing the candidate?</span></li> \n<li><span>Persistence: Call what it is — a rejection of the science — and keep calling it that.</span></li> \n<li><span>Confrontation: Try to raise the costs of denialism.</span></li> \n</ol>\n</blockquote> \n<p>Here was his somewhat dismal assessment:</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>What to do? All four paths have problems. In my view 2.) is the worst option, 1.) is not much better, 3.) is probably the best choice, but that doesn’t mean it will make a difference, and 4.) is the riskiest but might be a worth a try.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>As it happens, Media Matters has a <a href=""http://mediamatters.org/research/2015/07/01/study-how-the-media-is-covering-presidential-ca/204176"">new report</a> out that takes a look at this question in some detail.</p> \n<p>First, they analyzed 54 stories from seven major newspapers and wire services appearing between March 23 (when Cruz became the first candidate to announce) and June 22. In each of the stories, a presidential candidate either denies that climate change is happening or equivocates about whether humans are substantially responsible.</p> \n<p>The report tries to separate stories that fact-checked those claims from stories that let them pass uncorrected. Here's a positive example, a <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2015/03/23/us/politics/ap-us-gop-2016-cruz-issues.html"">March 23 AP story</a>:</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>Cruz says that for the past 17 years, satellite images show that ""there's been zero global warming."" But scientific experts say satellite data is the wrong way to measure global warming, which the vast majority of scientists say is happening and is caused by the burning of fossil fuels.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Here's <a href=""http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/05/21/us-usa-election-bush-environment-idUSKBN0O62LD20150521?irpc=932"">Reuters on May 21</a>:</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>Bush, answering questions from reporters after an event in Salem, New Hampshire, defended remarks he made a day earlier in which he said scientific research does not clearly show how much of climate change is caused by humans and how much is from natural causes.</p> \n<p>The United Nations panel of climate scientists, which is composed of thousands of the world's leading climate change experts, says it is at least 95 percent probable that most of the warming since 1950 is caused by man-made greenhouse gases.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>In contrast, here's the <a href=""http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2015/04/22/obama-visits-everglades-to-press-climate-change-agenda/""><i>Wall Street Journal</i></a><a href=""http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2015/04/22/obama-visits-everglades-to-press-climate-change-agenda/""> on April 22</a>:</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>Mr. Rubio recently questioned humans’ role in climate change and said efforts to reverse such changes would have a devastating impact on the economy.</p> \n<p>""I believe climate is changing because there’s never been a moment where the climate is not changing,"" Mr. Rubio said on CBS’s ""Face the Nation."" ""The question is, what percentage of that or what is due to human activity?""</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>And then ... that's it. It also mentions skeptical comments from Jeb Bush and Fla. governor Rick Scott on climate. At no point does it note that Rubio and co. are, factually speaking, wrong.</p> \n<p>And so on (there are lots more examples in the report). Here's the final score:</p> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""3840936""><img src=""https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3840936/media-matters-denialism-coverage.jpg""></div> \n<p>Out of 54 stories, 31 noted the factual inaccuracy of a candidate's claims while 23 did not. I was actually pleasantly surprised by these numbers. They reflect spreading adoption of Rosen's strategy No. 3, which I would not have predicted.</p> \n<p>It likely has something to do with the uptick in good climate and energy journalism in the US these days, usually outside the campaign-journalism beat. Chris Mooney is leading a <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/"">great team</a> at the Washington Post. NYT has Coral Davenport, among <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.nytimes.com/pages/business/energy-environment/index.html"">others</a>. Politico recently hired ace energy (and other stuff) reporter <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.politico.com/reporters/MichaelGrunwald.html"">Mike Grunwald</a>. There's <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.nationaljournal.com/reporters/bio/211"">Ben Geman</a> and <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.nationaljournal.com/reporters/bio/191"">Clare Foran</a> at National Journal, the team at <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://thinkprogress.org/climate/issue/"">Climate Progress</a>, and a whole host of dedicated sites like <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.climatecentral.org/"">Climate Central</a>, <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://midwestenergynews.com/"">Midwest Energy News</a>, <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://insideclimatenews.org/"">InsideClimate News</a>, and more. Smart writing on climate and energy is much easier to find today than it ever has been. (I'm sure I'm forgetting a bunch!)</p> \n<p>And then there's TV. Media Matters takes a look at the TV news landscape:</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>From March 23 to June 22, the major broadcast and cable news networks aired 37 segments featuring a presidential candidate denying climate science, and 12 of these segments (32 percent) failed to note that the candidate's position contradicts the scientific consensus on climate change. MSNBC accounted for the vast majority of television coverage noting the scientific consensus, as TV outlets other than MSNBC collectively failed to fact-check candidates' climate science denial 75 percent of the time.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>This is evidence, if you need any more, that among the demographic targeted by news shows — to wit: old people — fact-checking climate claims is still seen as ""liberal.""</p> \n<p>There's a video roundup of the <a href=""http://mediamatters.org/blog/2015/07/01/the-best-and-worst-media-interviews-with-climat/204206"">best and worst from TV news</a> if you can stand to watch TV news, which I cannot.</p> \n<p>Anyway, long story short, while TV news remains a wasteland, there are signs that climate denialism isn't getting the free ride is used to get among print and online journalists. Maybe Rosen's strategy No. 3 will be more popular than he expected.</p>",Television

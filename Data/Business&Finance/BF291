Here's how incredible computer word processing seemed in 1982
Today, everyone takes it for granted that you can type text into a computer and edit it on the screen. But this wasn't always such a commonplace activity. Indeed, it used to seem downright miraculous, as this 1982   in the Atlantic shows: Computers have improved so much over the past three decades that it's hard to even describe the difference. The computer Fallows owned in 1982 had 48 kilobytes of memory. That was enough to store a few pages of text, but it would be too little to hold many modern webpages or even a single high-resolution photo. I'm typing this on a MacBook Air with eight gigabytes of memory — more than 100,000 times more. And the comically underpowered computers people bought in 1982 were expensive. Fallows spent about $4,000 for his, which would be more than $10,000 in today's dollars. In contrast, my MacBook Air cost me about $1,200.

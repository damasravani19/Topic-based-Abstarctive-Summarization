Chrysler recalls 1.4 million vehicles after hackers show they're flawed
  Chrysler will distribute USB sticks with upgraded software to affected customers. In a   to Wired reporter Andy Greenberg earlier this week, two hackers showed the ability to hack into a Jeep Cherokee from miles away, gain control of its internal network, and then tamper with its transmission, brakes, and other safety-critical features. As the two hackers remotely toyed with the air-conditioning, radio, and windshield wipers, I mentally congratulated myself on my courage under pressure. That’s when they cut the transmission. Immediately my accelerator stopped working. As I frantically pressed the pedal and watched the RPMs climb, the Jeep lost half its speed, then slowed to a crawl. This occurred just as I reached a long overpass, with no shoulder to offer an escape. The experiment had ceased to be fun. The hackers, Charlie Miller and Chris Valasek, are professional security researchers, so they aren't planning to use their discovery for evil. But malicious hackers could use the same techniques to remotely tamper with cars across the country. From his home in the St. Louis area, Miller scanned the network for vulnerable vehicles and showed Greenberg vulnerable cars in Texarkana, Texas; San Diego; and Michigan's Upper Peninsula. If he'd wanted to, he could have hacked into any of these vehicles and interfered with their brakes and transmissions, potentially causing a crash. Miller and Valasek notified Chrysler about this problem nine months ago, and the company   to fix the vulnerability. However, that patch wasn't easy for customers to install. The decision to issue a formal recall suggests that Chrysler is now taking the problem more seriously. Get our newsletter in your inbox twice a week.

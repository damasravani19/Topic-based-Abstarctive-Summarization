FCC chair: Corporations shouldn't control access to the internet
The Federal Communications Commission on Thursday   its strongest set of   rules yet. Prior to the vote, FCC Chair Tom Wheeler pointed to the 4 million comments his agency received from the public throughout the process, using them as an example of why corporations shouldn't dictate access to the internet. "Those 4 million comments also illustrate the importance of an open and unfettered network, and the role it plays as a core of free expression and democratic principles," Wheeler said. "While some other countries try to control the internet, the action that we take today is an irrefutable reflection of the principle that no one, whether government or corporate, should control a free and open access to the internet." Wheeler hit the same point again and again in his speech: "The internet is the ultimate vehicle for free expression. The internet is simply too important to allow broadband providers to be the ones making the rules." Listen to the best segments of the speech above. Get our newsletter in your inbox twice a week.

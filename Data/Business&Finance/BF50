Top Republican blasts new FCC net neutrality proposal as a "power grab"
A top Republican in Congress is blasting FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler's  . "Chairman Wheeler’s proposal to regulate the Internet as a public utility is not about net neutrality," says John Thune (R-SD), the chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, in an emailed statement Wednesday. "It is a power grab for the federal government by the chairman of a supposedly independent agency who finally succumbed to the bully tactics of political activists and the president himself." Republican leaders have traditionally been skeptical of the need for any network neutrality regulation. But as it became clear Wheeler was preparing to declare internet access a public utility — a move critics say would open it up to burdensome and outmoded regulation — they've made a tactical retreat. Thune, along with his House counterpart Rep. Fred Upton (R-MI), have proposed legislation that they say will protect network neutrality while protecting the internet from excessive regulation. Thune's line about "bully tactics" is apparently a reference to last year's grassroots lobbying campaign in favor of treating internet access as a public utility. Activists bombarded the agency with letters urging Wheeler to adopt stronger rules. President Barack Obama   in calling for stronger rules in November. "Regulating the Internet through ill-suited and antiquated authorities that were designed for the monopoly phone era will ultimately make the Internet more rigid and less innovative," Thune argues.  I originally described Thune as the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee rather than the Senate Commerce Committee. Get our newsletter in your inbox twice a week.

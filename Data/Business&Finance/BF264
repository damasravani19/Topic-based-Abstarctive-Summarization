On Wednesday, Apple's lead designer, Jony Ive, was promoted to Chief Design Officer. For some good analysis of the corporate politics behind the move and what it signals about Apple going forward, see   and  . Jobs's taste for merciless criticism was notorious; Ive recalled that, years ago, after seeing colleagues crushed, he protested.

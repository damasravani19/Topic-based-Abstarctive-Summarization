Success is often more painful and hard-won than the effortless veneer it projects when we look back on it in hindsight. Consider, for example, that Airbnb received seven rejections from potential investors in its early days, as co-founder and CEO Brian Chesky revealed in a   post. For $150,000, Chesky described, an investor in June 2008 could have secured about 10 percent of the company's stake.

Even high-risk investors will reject big opportunities if they don't fit into a predetermined set of criteria.

Television is dying. Slowly.
The average young person today spends a lot less time watching television than her parents or grandparents. And that time has been declining quickly in recent years, as shown in this chartÂ  :   
 In the first quarter of 2015, the average adult under 25 watched 16 percent less television than the same demographic watched a year earlier. For people between 25 and 34, television dropped by 9.2 percent in a year. And that comes after several years of smaller declines in the hours spent watching TV. But if these trends continue, that won't be true for long. Get our newsletter in your inbox twice a week.

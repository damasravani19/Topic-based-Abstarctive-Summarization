This week's most overhyped finance news is about Germany's bond market
Here's a month's worth of interest rates on German 10-year bonds,  : German bonds this year. ( ) This spike has the financial press (  /   /   /  ) into a tizzy  But is it economically significant? I am skeptical. Per   for the Financial Times, it's very unclear to well-informed people why this is happening. And if you zoom the chart out, this dramatic week of bond yields looks rather less interesting. Here's a six-month view: Six months of German bonds. And here's a one-year view: One year of German bonds. And a five-year view: Five years of German bonds. Long story short, the interest rate paid by the German government on its debt is still freakishly low by historical standards. The fact that yields moved back to January 2015 levels so quickly is certainly interesting, but the current level the market is at is pretty dull. This would have to go quite a bit farther up to even reach what you would consider a normal level of interest for investors to charge a government to borrow money.

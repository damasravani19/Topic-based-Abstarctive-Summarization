Chipotle's nationwide carnitas shortages are actually great news
I went to my friendly neighborhood Chipotle on Sunday, and it had no carnitas. I thought it was just an idiosyncratic supply hiccup, but then I started hearing from friends and acquaintances about   lack of pork at Chipotles around America. Was sharia coming to America?

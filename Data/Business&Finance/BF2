There's a case for companies putting more women on boards, but it's not profits
Fewer than 1 in 5 members of corporate boards at major companies are women, according to a new census of board members by Catalyst,  The further up the corporate ladder, you look, the scarcer and scarcer women become — while women make up 45 percent of the workforce at S&P 500 companies, they make up only 4.6 percent of those firms' CEOs.   
 ( ) Likewise, in a   of 140 studies, researchers from Lehigh and Syracuse Universities found women's board representation was only related to better stock performance in countries that already had higher levels of gender equality in other areas, like access to education and jobs. And when you looked at all countries together, that study found zero correlation between women's representation and market returns, like stock performance. However, they did find a consistently positive correlation with profits. Moreover, even if more women board members are in fact correlated with better performance, that doesn't necessarily mean that adding more women to your board will boost the bottom line. Really, it may be much more complicated than a simple causal link from more women to better performance — rather there are signs that healthier companies are more likely to put women on their boards. But maybe thinking about diversity in terms of how much profit it drives is a cynical way of thinking about something we all value. Adding a woman (or two or ten) to your board might not amp up your stock price, but there's something to be said for diversity for diversity's sake.

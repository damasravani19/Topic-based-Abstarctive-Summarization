After I   back in December, the most common feedback I got was that I should have written about Lyft's (and Uber's) problems with insurance. Traditionally, the car insurance market has been divided between commercial insurance policies for people who use their cars to earn a living, like taxi and limousine drivers, and personal insurance for everyone else. But ride-sharing drivers too often fall into a legal gray area: their personal insurance won't cover accidents that happen while drivers are on the clock, but full commercial insurance was too expensive for part-time drivers to afford. Uber and Lyft have stepped in with their own insurance policies that cover drivers most of the time they're working for the ride-sharing companies. However, there have still been   that can leave drivers exposed. Drivers have sometimes been caught in the middle of disputes between Uber and insurance companies about who should cover which accidents. The new framework is designed to eliminate these gaps by establishing a clear set of rules for which accidents can be covered by personal insurance policies and which ones must be covered by either Uber or drivers. The framework may also provide a boost for a new breed of supplemental policies being offered by a growing number of insurance companies. In January, both   and   announced a limited ride-sharing plan that covers a driver between the time "driver mode" is enabled and the time the driver accepts a hail (at which point full coverage from Uber or Lyft kick in).

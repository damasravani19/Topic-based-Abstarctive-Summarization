Why Republicans can't ignore the growing power of Latino voters,http://www.vox.com/2014/6/12/5803062/why-republicans-cant-ignore-the-growing-power-of-latino-voters,A new study shows why immigrant families are the force behind the growth of the Latino vote â€” and why that means Latinos will be more influential than ever,"<p><span>Every day, nearly 2,000 Latinos turn 18 and become eligible to vote. They're the driving force behind the continued growth of the Latino voting-eligible population, which is projected to rise 40 percent from 2012 to 2030 — to 40 million eligible voters.</span></p> \n<p>The growing Latino population has sparked a debate within the Republican party about whether the GOP needs to do more to appeal to Latinos. Some strategists have said that the party can continue to win elections by appealing primarily to white voters — in part because Latinos, historically, haven't been as likely to vote.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""right"">as more latinos are eligible to vote, more eligible latinos will actually be voting</q></p> \n<p>A <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://americanprogress.org/issues/immigration/report/2014/06/12/91446/the-latino-electorate-by-immigrant-generation/"">new report from the Center for American Progress</a> (a liberal think tank) provides evidence that this strategy is unlikely to work. The report finds that the growth of the Latino vote in America is being driven by immigrants and their children — the very people who have a personal stake in the immigration debate. <span>Furthermore, they find, Latino immigrants and the children of Latino immigrants are more likely to turn out for elections than subsequent generations of Latinos. </span></p> \n<p><span>That means that as more Latinos are eligible to vote, more eligible Latinos will actually be voting.

Lia Parada</p> \n</div> \n<p><span></span>As much as scholars and pundits are focused on the Latino vote, no one had really looked into where Latino voters were on the immigration family tree. This study used Census Bureau data to dig into not just how many Latinos voted in past elections — and how many will be eligible to vote in future ones — but what immigrant ""generation"" those voters come from.</p> \n<p><span>The study refers to immigrants who come to the US as ""first-generation;"" their children as ""second-generation;"" and their children's children as ""third-generation."" </span><span>While only some first-generation Latino immigrants become citizens and are therefore eligible to vote, this study looked only at the ones who are eligible. And all second-generation immigrants are US citizens by birth.</span></p> \n<h3>What the study found</h3> \n<p><b>1) Immigrant voters and voters whose parents are immigrants have a personal connection to the immigration debate</b></p> \n<p>This might sound self-evident, but it isn't. After all, the centerpiece of the immigration debate is whether to let the 11 million unauthorized immigrants in the US get legal status and perhaps eventual citizenship. And unauthorized immigrants themselves can't vote. It's not necessarily the case that Latino citizens would see common cause with them, either — some Republicans have argued that Latino citizens see unauthorized immigrants as competitors for their jobs.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""right"">68 percent of second-generation latino voters have a relative or close friend who's an unauthorized immigrant</q></p> \n<p>But consistently, polls have shown that <a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/immigration-immigrants-reform-us/who-supports-immigration-reforms-like-the-senate-bill"" target=""_blank"">Latino voters</a> do feel solidarity with the unauthorized. The CAP study shows that that's especially true among voters whose parents are immigrants — i.e. ""second-generation"" immigrants, in the study's terms. After all, many of the parents of second-generation immigrants are unauthorized themselves. The study found that 68 percent of second-generation Latino voters have a family member or close friend who's an unauthorized immigrant. And among all generations of Latinos, the second generation — the children of immigrants — is the most likely to feel that immigration reform needs to be passed in 2014.</p> \n<p><b>2) Immigrants and their children make up a majority of the Latino electorate </b></p> \n<p>Why do the priorities of second-generation immigrants matter? Because, according to the study, they're the fastest-growing Latino demographic.</p> \n<p>The CAP study looks at elections going back to 1996. At that time, third-generation immigrants (the grandchildren of immigrants) made up the majority of eligible Latino voters; the first and second generations (immigrants and their children) made up a combined 47 percent. But in the early 2000s, first and second generation immigrant eligible voters became the majority — in 2012, they made up 55 percent of all eligible Latino voters.</p> \n<p>Furthermore, the growth of the second generation of immigrants — the children of immigrants — is accelerating. From 1996 to 2008, second-generation Latino immigrants made up between 26 and 28 percent of all eligible Latino voters. In 2012, that spiked to 31 percent.</p> \n<p><b>3) That share is going to keep increasing for a long time</b></p> \n<p>The study focuses on Latino citizens who have turned 18, or will turn 18, between 2012 and 2016. There are 3.3 million of these Latino eligible voters — and the majority of them are the children of immigrants. 57 percent of Latinos who'll be eligible to vote for the first time in 2016, the study finds, have at least one immigrant parent. That's the generation most connected to the immigration debate.</p> \n<div style=""text-align:center""> \n<p> </p> \n</div> \n<div style=""text-align:center""> \n<div> \n<p><img alt=""Latinoelectorate1"" class=""photo"" src=""http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/assets/4602873/LatinoElectorate1.png""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Center for American Progress</p> \n</div> \n</div> \n<p><span> </span>And the trend doesn't stop in 2016, either. A majority of all Latino citizens who are currently under 18 — i.e. Latinos who will become eligible voters in the next 18 years — are second-generation immigrants. That includes 52 percent of all Latino citizens under age 5 — Latinos who'll be eligible to vote for president for the first time in the election of 2032.</p> \n<p><b>4) Immigrants and their children are more likely to turn out to vote than subsequent generations of Latinos</b></p> \n<p>What matters most isn't who's eligible to vote, but who actually turns out. And historically, in the words of the <a href=""http://www.pewhispanic.org/2012/11/14/an-awakened-giant-the-hispanic-electorate-is-likely-to-double-by-2030/"" target=""_blank"">Pew Research Center</a>, Latinos ""punch below their weight"" when it comes to turning out to vote. In 2012, 66 percent of African Americans who were eligible to vote did, and 64 percent of whites — but only 48 percent of eligible Latinos voted. (The turnout rate for Asian Americans was 47 percent.)</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""right"">among latinos, first- and second-generation immigrants are more likely to vote than third-generation ones</q></p> \n<p>The CAP study, however, shows that among Latinos, first- and second-generation immigrants are substantially more likely to vote than third-generation ones. First-generation immigrants (naturalized citizens) are the most likely to turn out to vote: their turnout rate's been over 50 percent in nearly every presidential election since 1996. But second generation immigrants, their children — and the fastest-growing generation — are more likely to turn out than third-generation immigrants.</p> \n<p>Obviously, there are other demographic factors behind voter turnout. For example, older citizens are much more likely to vote than younger ones. But even when comparing Latinos in the same age group to each other, the study found that turnout rates are higher for first- and second-generation immigrants than they are for third-generation ones. (The study only looks at the 2012 election when comparing age groups, but the study's author, Patrick Oakford, has told Vox that the pattern holds in most cases since 1996.)</p> \n<p> </p> \n<div class=""align-right""> \n<p> </p> \n</div> \n<p>Here's what that means. Right now, 45 percent of eligible Latino voters are third generation immigrants. Their turnout rate is relatively low for Latinos, so it's bringing overall Latino turnout down. But for the foreseeable future, a majority of Latino citizens turning 18 are going to be the children of immigrants — who are more likely to vote. And there will also be new Latino voters who've just been naturalized — first-generation immigrants — who are the <i>most </i>likely to vote.</p> \n<p>So going by generation, at least, it's reasonable to predict that Latino voter turnout is going to increase for the next several elections. And Latinos as a whole will start ""punching"" closer to their weight at the ballot box.</p> \n<h3>Why the study matters</h3> \n<p><b>It strengthens the argument that Republicans really do need to appeal to Latinos</b></p> \n<p>In 2004, George W. Bush won over 40 percent of the Latino vote. In 2012, Mitt Romney won <a href=""http://www.politico.com/blogs/burns-haberman/2012/11/romneys-hispanic-vote-share-percent-148801.html"" target=""_blank"">27 percent</a>. Many leading Republican pundits (like Karl Rove) say that the Republican Party needs to win more Latino votes if it wants to win back the White House.</p> \n<p>But <a href=""http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/07/03/should-republicans-just-focus-on-white-voters/?_php=true&amp;_type=blogs&amp;_r=0"" target=""_blank"">a number of conservative commentators</a> have argued that Republicans shouldn't go chasing after a demographic that's running away from them — instead, they should focus on maximizing their share of white voters, and making sure those voters go to the polls. They tend to point to analyses by <a href=""http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2013/06/21/the_case_of_the_missing_white_voters_revisited_118893.html"" target=""_blank"">Sean Trende of RealClearPolitics</a>, who doesn't advocate for a ""whites-only"" strategy, but whose analysis lays out how such a plan could be viable.</p> \n<p>One important part of this argument is that the Latino vote ""show(s) potential for growth, but that potential for growth has been completely unrealized over the past decade."" (Trende wrote that before the 2012 election, but, as Pew pointed out, the trend of Latinos ""punching below their weight"" continued through that election as well.)</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""right"">latinos are demographically primed to turn out more and more in future elections</q></p> \n<p>The new CAP study presents substantial evidence that Latino voters are going to start turning out more and more in future elections. They're demographically primed for it.</p> \n<p>That means that Republicans who are thinking about how to build a coalition that can win back the White House, but have decided the Latino vote isn't worth it, might want to reconsider.</p> \n<p><b>It makes the case that both parties need to take Latino voters' issues, especially immigration, seriously as legislation — not just rhetoric</b></p> \n<p>But the relationship between voter blocs and elected officials goes both ways. Politicians want to persuade a group of voters that they agree on the issues that group cares about. But once the politician's elected, the voter bloc needs to persuade him or her to act on those particular issues — as opposed to other issues that could demand attention. And the voters with the most clout, <a href=""http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-2508.2005.00357.x/abstract"" target=""_blank"">studies have shown</a>, are the voters who turned out to vote in the last election, and are most likely to turn out for the next one.</p> \n<p> </p> \n<div class=""align-right""> \n<p><img alt=""77430552"" class=""photo"" src=""http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/assets/4603025/77430552.jpg""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Weary of politics. David McNew/Getty</p> \n</div> \n<p>Latino voters' influence in 2012 led both parties to agree, in the days after President Obama's re-election victory, that immigration reform should be a legislative priority. But in previous years, Latinos hadn't necessarily been considered reliable enough voters to be worth prioritizing when setting a legislative agenda.</p> \n<p><span>This study shows that Latinos are primed to become a higher-turnout voting bloc. But </span><a style=""line-height: 1.5; background-color: #ffffff;"" href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/5/20/5734978/latinos-democrats-obama-deportation-record-poll"" target=""_blank"">polls are also showing</a><span> that the absence of immigration reform, and President Obama's record deportations of immigrants, are damaging the faith Latino voters have in the political process — and making them less likely to vote. The CAP study shows that the Latino vote is a growing demographic, but it's still an emerging and evolving one. And that might mean that policymakers in both parties should think about how their actions today could shape the attitudes of voters who cast their ballots for the first time in 2032.</span></p> \n<p><b>UPDATE: </b>The original version of this article characterized Sean Trende as supportive of the strategy for the Republican Party to maximize white votes. Trende's analysis has been used by those arguing for that strategy, but Trende himself does not favor that view.</p>",Politics
"The Scott Walker campaign finance investigation, explained",http://www.vox.com/2014/6/20/5825162/scott-walker-john-doe-criminal-scheme,"Why did prosecutors argue that he participated in a ""criminal scheme""?","<p><span>For nearly two years, Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker and several of his associates have been dogged by an investigation into activities surrounding the contested recall elections of 2011 and 2012. Yet many details of the investigation have been kept secret, trickling out only gradually in </span><a href=""http://media.jrn.com/documents/50+Doe+docs.pdf"" style=""line-height: 1.5; background-color: #ffffff;"">various</a> releases <span>of <a href=""http://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/1279382/wisconsin-scott-walker-documents.pdf"">documents</a>. </span><span>Meanwhile, state and federal courts have issued rulings that have slowed the investigation to a halt.</span></p> \n<p><span>On Wednesday, September 24, though, a federal court issued </span><a href=""http://www.thewheelerreport.com/wheeler_docs/files/09247thcircuit.pdf"">a ruling</a><span> removing one roadblock for the prosecutors — and making clear that this matter hasn't yet been resolved. </span><span>Yet prosecutors still face another key obstacle — they're fighting for court permission to use the evidence they think they need to build a case, and so far, one state judge has refused their request. Here's what you need to know about the John Doe investigation.</span></p> \n<p><q class=""center"" aria-hidden=""true"">no charges have been filed against anyone, and none appear imminent</q></p> \n<h3><span>What's the investigation about?</span></h3> \n<p><span>After Walker pushed through a law limiting the collective bargaining rights of public employees in 2011, several Republican state senators, and eventually Walker himself, were challenged in recall elections. Conservative outside groups spent millions on ads praising them and attacking their opponents.</span></p> \n<p><span>State law requires that any such nonprofits spending on election ads do so independently, </span><span>without any coordination with Walker or his aides. Prosecutors are arguing that they didn't do so — that, instead, Walker and two of his campaign consultants participated in a ""criminal scheme"" to ""utilize and direct"" the nonprofits' behavior. The investigation is being conducted under Wisconsin's unique </span><a href=""http://www.hbslawfirm.com/articles_display.php?id=72"">John Doe law</a><span>, which allows for many of the proceedings to be kept secret. The district attorney of Milwaukee, a Democrat, initiated the probe, but several other county prosecutors joined in, and a special prosecutor has since been appointed.</span></p> \n<p><span></span><span>Importantly, no charges have been filed against anyone, and none appear imminent. Most of the legal wrangling so far has focused instead on whether prosecutors had probable cause to raid and subpoena documents from the </span><span>consultants and nonprofit groups they believe to be involved.</span></p> \n<h3>Why do the prosecutors think a crime was committed?</h3> \n<p>As the recall campaigns began, <span>Walker's top political adviser, RJ Johnson, was in close contact with conservative outside groups — especially one called the Wisconsin Club for Growth. It's undisputed that </span><span>Johnson advised the Club to steer millions of dollars to other conservative nonprofits — some with close ties to him or his business partner, Deborah Jordahl. He also helped craft the Club's communications and advertising strategy, as it ran its own ads attacking or praising candidates in the state senate and state Supreme Court elections</span><span>.</span></p> \n<p><q class=""right"" aria-hidden=""true"">emails show walker and aides involved in fundraising for an outside group</q></p> \n<p><span>In court documents, prosecutors claim that Johnson in fact directed the activities of the Club, and used it as a ""hub"" for coordinating outside spending on the recall. As evidence, t</span><span>hey say that Johnson has stated ""We own CFG,"" and that Jordahl was a signatory to the group's bank account. </span><span>Since Johnson was being paid by Walker's campaign at the time, prosecutors argue that this is illegal coordination between a paid campaign ""agent"" and an avowedly-independent outside group. And they say that the ads Johnson helped coordinate were, effectively, contributions to political campaigns.</span></p> \n<p><span></span><span>The prosecutors argued in one document that Walker, too, was involved in this ""criminal scheme."" Much of their basis for this claim was revealed in a </span><a href=""http://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/1279382/wisconsin-scott-walker-documents.pdf"">court filing</a><span> accidentally made public in August, revealing more emails prosecutors had obtained. </span><span>In April 2011, Walker consultant Kate Doner wrote to Johnson, ""As the Governor discussed... he wants all the issue advocacy efforts run thru one group to ensure correct messaging."" She added, ""The Governor is encouraging all to invest in the Wisconsin Club for Growth."" A June 2011 email to Walker from an aide advises him to tell donors to donate to ""your 501c4."" Another email, from Doner to Walker and Johnson, suggests raising money from the Koch brothers and Sheldon Adelson. An email from an associate to Walker, prepping him from a donor meeting, says ""This meeting is for WiCFG Funds,"" and adds, ""THE ASK: contribute $100k to WiCFG."" It seems clear that Walker was involved in the group's fundraising. </span><span>""</span><span>State prosecutors detail instance after instance of Walker meeting with high dollar donors and a check being received shortly afterwards by WCFG,"" </span><a href=""http://www.prwatch.org/news/2014/08/12577/walker-solicits-funds-outside-group-win-recalls"" style=""line-height: 1.5; background-color: #ffffff;"">Mary Bottari</a><span> writes.</span></p> \n<p><span>It's important to note that a lawyer for the special prosecutor has clarified that Walker ""</span><a href=""http://host.madison.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/scott-walker-not-a-target-john-doe-special-prosecutor-says/article_9d5579ed-039d-5f22-ac98-947469c3c22d.html"">was not a target</a><span>"" of the investigation, and that he has not been subpoenaed. The ""criminal scheme"" comment that mentioned his name, the lawyer said, was just an argument ""in support of further investigation"" to determine ""if criminal charges against any person or entity are warranted."" That doesn't mean Walker's in the clear — but it means that prosecutors probably weren't close to charging him with anything.</span></p> \n<p>However, the current issue holding up the investigation isn't even about whether charges should be filed against anyone. Instead, there's a dispute about whether all this presented <i>probable cause</i> to justify <span>subpoenaing Johnson, Jordhal, and the groups for documents. At first, the judge assigned to the case agreed with prosecutors that it did — in October 2013, the consultants' homes </span><a href=""http://m.jsonline.com/261867771.htm"" style=""line-height: 1.5; background-color: #ffffff;"">were raided</a><span>, and subpoenas </span><a href=""http://talkingpointsmemo.com/muckraker/wisconsin-john-doe-investigation-focused-on-conservative-groups"" style=""line-height: 1.5; background-color: #ffffff;"">went out</a><span> to the Club and other groups, asking for financial records, emails, and other documents.</span></p> \n<h3>Why <i>wouldn't</i> all this be probable cause for a subpoena?</h3> \n<p><span>There's one big problem for the prosecutors' case. </span><span>Watch the ad below — do you think it's a campaign ad?</span></p> \n<div align=""center""> \n<p><iframe width=""420"" height=""315"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/v7MTfjZf0Gg"" frameborder=""0""></iframe></p> \n</div> \n<p><span>Most ordinary people would say — of course that's a campaign ad, designed to trash Sandy Pasch's reputation right before her election. But, actually, the ad never mentions anything about an election. In its final line, the ad urges viewers to call Sandy Pasch — not to vote against her. </span><span>The Wisconsin Club for Growth, and the groups that it funded, only paid for these kinds of ads.  And u</span><span>nder federal campaign finance law, that would mean this is an ""issue ad"" — and not an illegally-coordinated campaign ad.</span></p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""right"">Judge Peterson ruled that prosecutors failed to show probable cause</q></p> \n<p>Since the Club and the groups it funded only paid for these kinds of ads, there's an argument that nothing illegal happened at all <span>— and, therefore, that the prosecutors didn't have probable cause to suspect a crime. That instead, they were just going on a fishing expedition. </span><span>So, after the raids, several targeted groups filed a motion asking for the subpoenas to be ""quashed."" </span><span>In response, the p</span><span>rosecutors argued that Wisconsin law is more restrictive of issue ads than federal law is.</span><span> </span></p> \n<p>About a month after the subpoenas went out, the judge who had approved them, Barbara Kluka,<span> </span><a href=""http://www.jsonline.com/blogs/news/232433971.html"" style=""line-height: 1.5; background-color: #ffffff;"">recused herself</a><span> </span><span>from the case for unknown reasons, so judge Gregory Peterson replaced her. And</span><span> in January 2014, Peterson ruled </span><span>that the subpoenas should never have gone out, writing that prosecutors failed </span><span>""to show probable cause that a crime was committed."" He wrote that since the outside groups only funded issue ads, </span><span>the coordination the prosecutors purported to show was in fact perfectly legal.</span></p> \n<p>Initially, Peterson ordered the return of all documents seized. This could have significantly reduced, or perhaps even wiped out, the prosecution's chances at making a case. <span>But two weeks later he stayed that order, so the evidence would be preserved in case a state appeals court ruled differently. The prosecutors' argument that they had probable cause, Peterson </span><a href=""http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/john-doe-judge-stays-own-order-for-seized-documents-to-be-returned-b99225305z1-250339351.html"" style=""line-height: 1.5; background-color: #ffffff;"">wrote</a><span>, ""</span><span>is not frivolous. In fact, it is an arguable interpretation of the statutes. I simply happen to disagree. An appellate court may indeed agree with the state."" </span><span>The prosecutors soon </span><a href=""http://www.vox.com/admin/entries/new?community_id=441&amp;entry_type=Article"" style=""background-color: #ffffff;"">appealed</a><span> the ruling, but the state appellate court has not yet ruled on the matter — because a federal judge then halted the investigation for several months.</span></p> \n<h3><span>Why did a federal judge halt the investigation?</span></h3> \n<p>In February 2014, the Wisconsin Club for Growth and its director Eric O'Keefe filed a federal lawsuit. They alleged that the prosecutors' unjustified investigation and subpoenas had <span>violated their First Amendment rights to free speech — chilling their group's fundraising and crippling its ability to advocate in this year's elections.</span></p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""right"">""This cannot square with the First Amendment""</q></p> \n<p><span>In May, federal district court judge Rudolph Randa agreed. </span><span>""The plaintiffs have been shut out of the political process, merely by association with conservative politicians,"" Randa wrote, in a fiery opinion. ""This cannot square with the First Amendment and what it was meant to protect."" He agreed with Judge Peterson's ruling that the subpoenas were unjustified, because the groups only aired perfectly legal issue ads. </span><span>Furthermore, Randa wrote, ""The theory of 'coordination' forming the basis of the investigation... is not supported under Wisconsin law, and, if it were, would violate the United States Constitution."" </span><span>So Randa ordered that the state investigation be halted. He even ruled that </span><span>all documents collected from the subpoenas and raids must be returned or destroyed.</span></p> \n<p><span>But a federal appeals court panel stayed the order to destroy documents, and decided to hear prosecutors' appeal of Randa's ruling. On Sep</span><span>tember 24, they </span><a href=""http://www.thewheelerreport.com/wheeler_docs/files/09247thcircuit.pdf"">voted</a><span> unanimously to</span><span> reverse it. ""Principles of equity, comity and federalism counsel against a federal role here,"" wrote Judge Frank Easterbrook, a Reagan appointee. So, unless there's an appeal by Walker's team, the action will move back to state courts.</span></p> \n<h3>What happens next?</h3> \n<p>The federal roadblock to the investigation has been removed, but the state one remains. <span>Now, the question of whether prosecutors had probable cause to launch raids against and subpoena documents from the consultants and nonprofit groups will be revisited by a Wisconsin appeals court. But this latest news makes it clear that the legal wrangling isn't yet over.</span></p>",Politics

So much of America's history has been about movement — centuries of migration and settlement and, finally, agglomeration — and geography and ecology have greatly influenced how that played out.</p> \n<p>The country's history has also often been about its tremendous resource wealth and over contests for its land: in the competitions among European powers, in the campaigns of conquest and genocide by colonists against native communities, in the rise of slavery to work the land, and eventually in the civil war that divided the country. America's geography is still crucial for it today: because it is effectively an island nation, it has been safer and thus freer to project power abroad, and its resource wealth has fueled its rise to global dominance.</p>",Politics

And why is this suddenly on the agenda? We have answers.</p> \n<h3>1) What is a tax inversion?</h3> \n<p><img alt=""14574696381_3bbaea2f22_h"" class=""photo"" src=""http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/assets/4825238/14574696381_3bbaea2f22_h.jpg""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Walgreens in Meridien, CT (<a href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/jeepersmedia/14574696381/in/photolist-ocV8sD-nVHTZ2-nVHzu7-by2EDQ-h7REw2-69ZQKv-8dPwYZ-nzLzAh-ebj61A-osqZC6-osqZ4v-dU5weF-eM8iq3-525SRU-8X8QLv-62rAKn-3rNcAw-8dzvgF-kogik1-7dP8Tt-qdmvf-nS39rs-r1hnK-nNHqwW-nSxtwg-nygx6C-nygkhL-48pd4f-j7bSxM-obiTnx-nyggzX-6Q2X6c-obiT2T-hJK14-9RqwP4-bvSDDN-omVj4-e2FS12-c2utK9-57bxKh-38pfVs-nBqvrj-bw4Bvy-bJYn5i-93thsL-8zEF5d-kodkYV-koefk6-kodxAc-koeeYz"">Mike Mozart</a>)</p> \n<p>To an extent, a tax inversion is in the eye of the beholder. But the basic idea of a tax inversion is this..<a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/federal-taxes-explained/US-corporate-income-taxes-highest-in-the-world"">Different countries tax corporate profits in different ways</a> and at different rates. So a company whose business is subject to relatively heavy taxation in one country (say, the United States) can buy a smaller company located in a country where its business is taxed at a lower rate (say, Ireland) and then declare the merged entity to be domiciled in the low-tax country for the purposes of taxation. Walgreens, for example, is in the process of buying a Swiss company called Alliance Boots and is considered relabeling itself as a subsidiary of the Swiss company to pay lower Swiss tax rates until forced to abandon the idea after political backlash.</p> \n<p>You can think of there as being two levels of tax inversion.</p> \n<p>In a modest tax inversion, Company A decides to acquire Company B for some standard set of business reasons. It then turns out to be the case that domiciling the merged entity in Company B's homeland is more advantageous for tax purposes. Companies, like people, normally seek to exploit legal means of reducing their tax burden. So the merged company will probably domicile itself for tax purposes in Company B's country.</p> \n<p>In a pure tax inversion, Company A decides to acquire Company B specifically in order to execute a tax inversion. In other words, Company A would be acquiring Company B not so much to obtain its technology or its brand or its supply chain but its tax status.</p> \n<h3>2) How is this different from a normal cross-border merger?</h3> \n<p>Currently there is no bright-line legal distinction between a tax inversion and any other kind of international corporate merger. But in a broad qualitative sense, the difference is that in a pure tax inversion <i>almost nothing changes on the ground</i>.</p> \n<p>Contrast this with, say, the takeover of Anheuser-Busch (makers of Budweiser) by the Belgian company Inbev in 2008. The United States is obviously a much larger country than Belgium, so the new merged company AB Inbev sells more beer in the USA than in Belgium. But the company is Belgian, not just as a tax matter but in terms of the physical location of its corporate headquarters in Leuven. And in terms of personnel, the CEO of AB Inbev is the guy who was CEO of Inbev before the merger.</p> \n<p>A tax inversion would be something like a large American brewery buying a small Belgian one, keeping its old American CEO and Midwestern corporate headquarters, but declaring that it's now a Belgian company.</p> \n<h3>3) How common are tax inversions?</h3> \n<div style=""text-align:center""><img src=""http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/assets/4824542/goldman_tax_inversions.png"" class=""photo"" alt=""Goldman_tax_inversions""></div> \n<p>Since there's no formal definition of a tax inversion, it's difficult to count them exactly. But Goldman Sachs' analysis put together a chart showing their count of inversion volume — scaled to the pretax revenue of the companies involved rather than the total number of companies — showing that it's been rising for the past few years and positively exploded in 2014. Note that the majority of the 2014 bar represents proposed deals that were eventually withdrawn, but that even if we don't count proposed deals, 2014 is still a record year.</p> \n<p>The most important inversions of 2014 have been a proposed (but ultimately canceled) effort by Pfizer to acquire Astra-Zeneca, Medtronic's acquisition of Covidien, AbbView's acquisition of Shire, and now <a href=""http://online.wsj.com/articles/burger-king-in-talks-to-buy-tim-hortons-1408924294"">perhaps Burger King becoming Canadian</a>.</p> \n<h3>4) Why are inversions surging now?</h3> \n<p>There are two main reasons. One is that low interest rates in the United States and Europe are making it cheaper for companies to buy each other than has normally been the case. That's leading to <a href=""http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2014/01/14/merger_mania_m_a_is_booming.html"">a lot of merger activities of all kinds</a>. Since some tax inversions are side-effects of mergers undertaken for other reasons, anything that boosts merger activity will tend to boost inversions. And anything that makes it cheaper to pull off a merger encourages companies to look for more inversion opportunities.</p> \n<p>The other, more important reason is political gridlock. As you can see in the Goldman Sachs' chart in question four, inversion surges have happened in the past. But previous waves of inversions have been halted by new anti-inversion legislation. Not only have those crackdowns halted inversions, but <i>fear</i> of crackdowns tends to halt inversions. Companies are reluctant to push the envelop in ways that are likely to prompt regulatory or legislative backlash. But as inversions began to make a comeback in the Obama years, no crackdown was forthcoming. And it doesn't take a multi-millionaire investment banker to tell you that these days congressional Republicans are in no mood to pass Obama-friendly legislation, especially legislation that would raise taxes. So companies are getting bolder and bolder with their inversion proposals. Now the White House finally is proposing anti-inversion legislation, but its odds of passage look dim for the same basic reason the odds of anything else passing look dim.</p> \n<h3><span>5) This is literally the most boring thing ever. Music break?</span></h3> \n<p>Listen, many billions of dollars are at stake. It's not <i>that</i> boring.</p> \n<p>Here's Eric Clapton and George Harrison playing ""The Taxman"":</p> \n<p><iframe frameborder=""0"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/y8OgkjcW0g4"" height=""315"" width=""420""></iframe> <br id=""1406585722024""></p> \n<h3>6) What is the Obama administration proposing to do about inversions?</h3> \n<p><img alt=""Shutterstock_207055495"" class=""photo"" src=""http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/assets/4825214/shutterstock_207055495.jpg""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">(Niyazz/<a href=""http://www.shutterstock.com/pic-207055495/stock-photo-usa-tax-form-with-us-dollar-bills.html?src=V5X5gC1aO9asWa8z+X3Nig-1-12"">Shutterstock</a>)</p> \n<p>The White House actually wrote an inversion proposal into the budget it released in March, though it only became a substantial focus of presidential messaging this summer. The original proposal would have made inversions more or less impossible, and also would have retroactively penalized inversions completed earlier in the year. But those proposals would have required legislation to pass congress, which of course was very unlikely to happen.</p> \n<p>On September 22, Treasury instead released a broad suite of <a href=""http://www.treasury.gov/press-center/press-releases/Pages/jl2645.aspx"">new rules and interpretations of rules</a> that make inversions more difficult. These rules generally would make it much more difficult for an inverting entity to <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/9/22/6830683/heres-obamas-plan-to-curb-corporate-tax-inversions"">shift funds around various</a>subsidiaries for tax purposes, and would also strengthen enforcement of the last round of anti-inversion rules.</p> \n<p><span>7) Is corporate income tax reform the real answer here?</span></p> \n<p>The United States has more or less the <a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/federal-taxes-explained/US-corporate-income-taxes-highest-in-the-world"">highest official corporate income tax rate in the world</a>, but it's so shot full of loopholes that very few companies pay anything close to the official rate. This is widely regarded as a lamentable situation, and there is overwhelming political consensus around the idea that the corporate income tax code should be reformed. The broad idea is that the rate should be brought down, but loopholes should be closed. The resulting system would treat companies more fairly, and also should help US-based firms compete in global markets.</p> \n<p>Corporate tax reform keeps not happening, however, for two reasons.</p> \n<p>One is that there's big picture ideological disagreement between Republicans and Democrats as to whether the goal of reform should be to raise more tax revenue or less. Everyone agrees that the current structure of the code is bad, but absent consensus about revenue targets it's hard to build a coalition for reform. <span>The other is that while it's easy for everyone to agree on the idea of ""closing loopholes,"" it's very difficult to agree on exactly </span><i style=""line-height: 1.5;"">which loopholes</i><span> should be closed. </span></p> \n<p>Were broad corporate tax reform to pass, it would likely reduce the incentive for inversions somewhat. On the other hand, depending on exactly which loopholes were closed it might create more incentive for inversions in certain sectors. Either way, inversions themselves are a huge loophole that companies will almost certainly continue to seek to exploit unless they are specifically restrained from doing them.</p> \n<h3>8) Are high taxes driving companies out of the USA?</h3> \n<p><img alt=""231702549_00d67de463_b"" class=""photo"" src=""http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/assets/4825230/231702549_00d67de463_b.jpg""></p> \n<p class=""caption""> </p> \n<p class=""caption"">(<a href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/rodefeld/231702549/in/photolist-7uys1-Bzxus-Bzxaa-Bxufq-ekFJyQ-ba8H-6u7c4x-eD5M4-hFTq1W-dZcoQ1-39Wstq-nPu9UG-v8jZX-gxzCVN-7L2Rdu-5R11B1-Bzwuu-BzwPa-mtx6x-bBQhJX-a3nCoB-9iMCFA-fFGNFp-mz3ZHP-Ms4XV-4wg7QM-fNR4HB-jDogJS-fFYWRC-fn1Uso-zAcT5-gn5i4k-6yCy3K-8N6ZoM-4UruoP-v8te1-9eZSR1-9me99e-fmsCCg-81Gf9T-dSFuxm-7Ddebk-eEM8Tx-fgaMjG-vb2nY-5McVFN-cdP6Rh-8Sbq6x-dHMe7o-hwKndm"">Cord Rodefeld</a>)</p> \n<p>If they are, then tax inversions certainly aren't the proof. A tax inversion incurs when a company <i>doesn't</i> actually relocate its management or operations into another country, it just moves on paper to avoid taxes.</p> \n<p>Non-corporations generally don't have this option. Income taxes are considerably higher for highly paid individuals living in California than for highly paid individuals living in Florida or Texas. Some rich Californians probably decamp to Florida or Texas for this reason. But most rich Californians stay in California, where they enjoy both California lifestyle amenities and the ability to work in the California-based entertainment and software industries. But suppose California changed its law so that anyone who bought a random house in Texas could declare himself a resident of Texas for tax purposes, regardless of where he actually works or spends his time. In that case, a huge share of rich Californians would buy Texas houses and register as tax Texans.</p> \n<p>Characterizing that as people ""fleeing California's high taxes"" would be very misleading — nobody is actually leaving California.</p> \n<p>By the same token, Burger King is not proposing to <i>actually move to Canada</i>. The proposal is simply to reshuffle the paperwork so that a large American burger chain will be considered a subsidiary of a smaller Canadian doughnut one. The business will still be managed in the USA.</p> \n<h3>9) What are the objections to Obama's plan?</h3> \n<p>The short version is Obama is proposing higher taxes and Republicans don't like higher taxes.</p> \n<p>The longer version raises a few points. One is the idea that trying to address specific individual issues in the corporate tax code outside the context of broader corporate income tax reform would be a mistake. Another is that Utah Senator Orrin Hatch, seemingly speaking for most of his Republican colleagues, <a href=""http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-07-22/hatch-s-conditions-on-inversion-law-show-partisan-split.html"">objects to the idea of retroactive penalties</a>. A third objection is that penalizing firms who switch tax domicile without moving their headquarters abroad might encourage companies to move their headquarters abroad rather than discouraging them from changing their tax domicile.</p> \n<p><iframe width=""420"" height=""315"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/E2h8ujX6T0A"" frameborder=""0""></iframe> <br id=""1406560193011""></p> \n<p>Underlying much of this is a broader skepticism in many circles about the whole idea of taxing corporate income. When Mitt Romney somewhat infamously said that ""corporations are people"" this is what he meant — not the <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/7/1/5860742/5-mistakes-liberals-make-about-corporate-personhood-and-hobby-lobby"">legal concept of corporate personhood</a> — but the idea that a tax on corporate income is ultimately a tax on the people who own the company. Conservatives, <a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/federal-taxes-explained/why-is-investment-income-taxed-at-a-lower-rate-than-regular-income"">supported by some-but-not-all academic economists of diverse political views</a>, generally believe that taxes on investment income and capital accumulation are harmful to long-term economic growth. In this view, even if inversions are egregious loophole-exploitation they are a symptom of a bad tax system rather than of bad behavior.</p>",Politics

(Photo by Mark Wilson/Getty Images)</p> \n<p>It is basically impossible for Democrats to win back the House until after 2020. The reasons are threefold, as Andrew Prokop has <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/8/4/5960095/what-would-it-take-for-democrats-to-win-the-house"">explained</a>.</p> \n<p>First, geography has a GOP bias. Democrats tend to live in more densely packed, urban districts. Republicans tend to live in more broadly spread-out, rural districts. That makes it easier to draw maps that efficiently disperse Republicans across many districts. Democrats cluster together in a way that leads them to ""waste"" a lot of votes on candidates who were going to win anyway.</p> \n<p>Second, <a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/gerrymandering-explained/what-is-gerrymandering"">gerrymandering</a> has a GOP bias. In most states, politicians get to draw congressional boundaries. This is done after every Census, so the last time it was done was after the 2010 Census — which followed the 2010 election, where Republicans swept into power in state legislatures across the country. The result was some pretty epic gerrymanders. In Ohio, for instance, Democrats won 52 percent of the House vote in 2012. But they only got four seats to the GOP's 12:</p> \n<center> \n<p><chorus-asset class=""chorus-snippet browser_wide_media"" data-id=""665768""> <img alt=""Ohio gerrymander"" class=""small"" src=""http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/665768/Screen_shot_2014-04-15_at_9.10.05_AM.0.png""> </chorus-asset></p> \n<p class=""caption""><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives_elections,_2012#mediaviewer/File:Ohio_Congressional_Districts_with_party_colors,_2013-2015,_unlabeled.svg"">Image: lbagli</a></p> \n</center> \n<p>Neat, huh? You can see some of the other most gerrymandered states <a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/gerrymandering-explained/what-are-the-most-gerrymandered-house-delegations"">here</a>.</p> \n<p>The combination of geography carrying a GOP bias and gerrymandering carrying a GOP bias means that Democrats can't just win back the House by winning more votes.</p> \n<p>In 2012, they won won 1.4 million more votes than Republicans, but Republicans ended up with a 234-201 majority in the chamber. To win back the House, Democrats need to win <i>a lot</i> more votes. They're not going to do that in a midterm election when they hold the White House.</p> \n<p>And that gives Republicans a third advantage in the House: the power of incumbency. All else equal, incumbents have an advantage over challengers. ""On average, an incumbent in 2012 ran five percentage points ahead of a non-incumbent candidate from the same party in a similar seat,"" John Sides and Eric McGhee of the Monkey Cage <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/02/17/redistricting-didnt-win-republicans-the-house/"">wrote</a>. And Republicans have a lot more incumbents in the House than Democrats.</p> \n<h3>5) Republicans are very likely to win the Senate in 2014</h3> \n<p><chorus-asset class=""chorus-snippet browser_wide_media"" data-id=""673838""> <img alt=""Mitch McConnell smiling"" class=""small"" src=""http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/673838/453083192.0.jpg""> </chorus-asset></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Mitch McConnell might run the Senate come 2015. (Win McNamee/Getty Images)</p> \n<p>Unlike in the House, where every seat is up for reelection, only about a third of the Senate is up for reelection in any given cycle. In 2014, the third of the Senate up for reelection is the third of the Senate that won their seats in 2008. And since 2008 was a very Democratic year, that means Democrats are caught defending many more seats than Republicans.</p> \n<p>Of the 36 seats up for reelection in 2014, Democrats control 21 of them. Republicans only control 15. So Republicans have many more opportunities to win seats than Democrats do.</p> \n<p>That's one reason why pretty much every major forecaster is currently projecting that Republicans will retake the Senate in 2014. The New York Times gives them a <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/newsgraphics/2014/senate-model/"">67 percent</a> chance. The Washington Post gives them a <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-tran/politics/election-lab-2014"">61 percent</a> chance. ""The most likely outcome involves the Republicans winning about the six seats they need to take over the Senate, give or take a couple,"" <a href=""http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/republican-gop-senate-forecast/"">writes</a> Nate Silver.</p> \n<h3>6) Republicans are very likely to lose the Senate in 2016</h3> \n<p><chorus-asset class=""chorus-snippet browser_wide_media"" data-id=""673842""> <img alt=""Harry Reid smiling"" class=""small"" src=""http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/673842/123992358.0.jpg""> </chorus-asset></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Don't call it a comeback.  (Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images)</p> \n<p>Though Senate Democrats are in bad shape this year, they're not particularly concerned. That's because they're pretty sure that, even if they lose the Senate in 2014, they'll win it back in 2016.</p> \n<p>The 2016 Senate map is even more favorable to Democrats than the 2014 Senate map is to Republicans. The 2016 election puts the Senate class of 2010 up for reelection. And 2010 was a very good year for Republicans — which means the 2016 election will leave Republicans defending a ton of seats.</p> \n<p>As of now, it looks like Democrats will be defending 10 seats to the GOP's 24, and doing it amidst the more favorable demographics of a presidential election.</p> \n<h3>7) The average age on the Supreme Court is 68</h3> \n<p><chorus-asset class=""chorus-snippet browser_wide_media"" data-id=""673844""> <img alt=""Supreme Court"" class=""small"" src=""http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/673844/105065262.0.jpg""> </chorus-asset></p> \n<p class=""caption"">None of these people use Tinder. (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)</p> \n<p>Because Congress is currently gridlocked and because a GOP takeover of the Senate is likely to be reversed in 2016, it's common to see people argue that the 2014 election doesn't much matter. Silver, for instance, <a href=""http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/the-2014-election-is-the-least-important-in-years/"">called it</a> ""the least important election in decades.""</p> \n<p>And it may well be! Or it could be one of the most important midterm elections in decades.</p> \n<p>The Supreme Court is currently divided 5-4. But Ruth Bader Ginsburg is 81. Antonin Scalia and Anthony Kennedy are both 78. Stephen Breyer is 76. John Roberts could decide he wants to live his dream of being a Hollywood sound engineer before it's too late.</p> \n<p><span>If Republicans take control of the Senate in 2014 then they'll have substantial veto power over any efforts President Obama might make to fill a vacancy that could reshape the Court. But if Democrats hold the Senate and Antonin Scalia unexpectedly retires, then the 2014 election might end up swinging control of one of America's three branches of government, with untold consequences that will reverberate for decades.</span></p> \n<p>For that matter, today's Supreme Court is the direct result of George W. Bush's contested election. If Al Gore had won the presidency in 2000 and reelection in 2004, then William Rehnquist and Sandra Day O'Connor would likely have been replaced by Democrats, and Supreme Court jurisprudence in the years since would be very different.</p> \n<p>The irony, of course, is that people said the 2000 election was one of the least important in history, too.</p> \n<h3>8) 36 states are holding gubernatorial elections this year</h3> \n<p><chorus-asset class=""chorus-snippet browser_wide_media"" data-id=""673846""> <img alt=""Butch Otter"" class=""small"" src=""http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/673846/99999773.0.jpg""> </chorus-asset></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Idaho Governor Butch Otter, a Republican, is running for a third term. (Photo By Mark F. Sypher/Roll Call/Getty Images)</p> \n<p>The House and Senate get most of the attention in midterm elections. But 36 states are also choosing who will be their next governor.</p> \n<p>That matters for state politics, obviously. For most people in most states, the person sitting in the governor's chair probably matters more than who represents them in Congress. But if you're a political junkie who only cares about national elections, then you should still keep an eye on the governor's races: presidents tend to be plucked from the governor's mansion, not from the House or Senate.</p> \n<p>Right now, Republicans hold 29 governorships to the Democrats' 21. But of the 36 seats up in 2014, Republicans are defending 23 and Democrats are defending only 13. That gives Democrats an edge, but it comes amidst the unfavorable climate of the midterm election. As such, Democrats aren't likely to make big gains.</p> \n<p><span>Wikipedia has a nice </span><a style=""line-height: 1.5; background-color: #ffffff;"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_gubernatorial_elections,_2014#Latest_predictions"">round-up</a><span> of predictions, but a good baseline can be found in Larry Sabato's </span><a href=""http://www.centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/2014-governor/"">forecast</a><span>: he sees the likely range as somewhere between Democrats picking up two governorships and Republicans picking up one.</span></p> \n<h3><span>9) Local elections are really important</span></h3> \n<p>The biggest bias in election coverage isn't towards Republicans or Democrats or even towards conflict and sensationalism. It's towards national elections rather than local elections. This is partly a question of resources: it's a lot easier for a news organization to cover national politics than local politics. And part of it is that the <span>media covers elections as the culmination of the bloodsport of American politics, and local elections don't really count towards that.</span></p> \n<p>But insofar as elections are about making and changing the laws that affect people's lives, local (and state) elections are wildly underemphasized. The major decisions around infrastructure, education, and criminal justice policy are made at the state level. The decisions around zoning, occupational licensing, and the management of many public services are made at the local level. For most Americans, these decisions will be as or more consequential than anything the federal government does.</p> \n<p>Moreover, turnout is so low in state and local elections, and people have so little information, that individual voters are much more powerful at the state and local level than they are at the federal level. This November, hundreds of cities will be choosing new mayors and new city councilmen — and that's to say nothing of superintendents, county executives, comptrollers, and all the rest. These elections matter, but national political parties and the national media devote a whole lot less time and resources into making people feel like they matter. So while you're obsessively tracking the national polls in September and October, take some time out to learn about who's running for what in your city.</p>",Politics

Brown's death has sparked a number of important discussions about police brutality, our fundamentally flawed justice system, crime in black communities, and how all of these things are part of a larger national issue. But I fear the people who most need to hear this won't be listening. Instead, they'll keep pointing fingers at gang members in Chicago or donating dollars to cops who kill  — anything to avoid the truth about America's greatest failure.</p>",Politics
One in six French people say they support ISIS,http://www.vox.com/2014/8/26/6067123/isis-poll,"ISIS appears to be more popular in France than in Gaza, based on recent polling.","<p>Two polls released this week both ask a question that you would hope wouldn't need asking: how many people support the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS)? Unfortunately, in all four countries surveyed, the answer is greater than zero, and by a lot.</p> \n<p>Here is a chart of the results of the polls. The first, <a href=""http://www.icmresearch.com/media-centre/press/isis-poll-for-rossiya-segodnya"">by ICM Research</a>, asked people in Germany, France, and the UK whether they had a favorable or unfavorable view of ISIS. The second, by the Palestinian Center for Public Opinion, asked Gazans whether they support or oppose ISIS. Here are the results.</p> \n<p><chorus-asset class=""chorus-snippet browser_wide_media"" data-id=""671672""> <img alt=""Screen_Shot_2014-08-25_at_4.16.57_PM.0.png"" class=""small"" src=""http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/671672/Screen_Shot_2014-08-25_at_4.16.57_PM.0.png""> </chorus-asset></p> \n<p>First, a caveat: while the polls of Gazans and Europeans are similar, they are not totally identical. They were conducted by different polling agencies using different methods, and the different question could skew responses, as ""support"" is stronger than ""favor."" So keep that in mind when comparing the Gaza results to the others, although it is hard to ignore that ISIS could have a higher approval rating in France than in Gaza.</p> \n<p>In any case, the big, scary, surprising, number here is France: 16 percent of those surveyed say they support ISIS. That's an awful lot. And that number gets even larger as the demographics get younger, as shown in this by-age breakdown published by Russia Today (the poll was commissioned by Russian state media, almost certainly to tar and/or troll Western countries, but that doesn't make the findings any less disturbing):</p> \n<p><chorus-asset data-id=""671674"" class=""chorus-snippet browser_wide_media""> <img src=""http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/671674/france_isis.0.png"" class=""small"" alt=""france_isis.0.png""> </chorus-asset></p> \n<p class=""caption"">(<a href=""http://rt.com/news/181076-isis-islam-militans-france/"">Russia Today</a>)</p> \n<p>This is alarming, in part because a growing number of Europeans, often from predominantly Muslim immigrant communities, are not just expressing their support for ISIS in polls: they are traveling to Syria and Iraq to join up. The ISIS fighter who killed American journalist James Foley on video last week spoke with a strong London accent. European governments are rightly worried about the implications of this for their own national security.</p> \n<p>But there's more going on here. It's no secret that far-right politics have been on the rise in Western Europe, which includes a growing willingness to embrace extremism and greater intolerance of all kinds. It is ironic but by no means impossible that far-right Islamophobia would rise in Europe alongside a greater approval of the Islamist group ISIS. Extremism is often reactive and ideologically contradictory.</p> \n<p>The growth of European intolerance has brought a rise in hate toward Jews in Europe, as well as Muslims. It's more complicated than extremism festering within predominantly Muslim immigrant communities. <span>""There is no clear correlation in Europe between the level of popular anti-Semitism and the size of the Muslim population,"" the British writer Kenan Malik </span><a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/22/opinion/kenan-malik-muslims-and-jews-are-targets-of-bigotry-in-europe.html"">explained recently</a><span> in the New York Times. He went on:</span></p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>The rise of identity politics has helped create a more fragmented, tribal society, and made sectarian hatred more acceptable generally.</p> \n<p>At the same time, the emergence of ""anti-politics,"" the growing contempt for mainstream politics and politicians noticeable throughout Europe, has laid the groundwork for a melding of radicalism and bigotry. Many perceive a world out of control and driven by malign forces; conspiracy theories, once confined to the fringes of politics, have become mainstream.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>The good news here may be the Gaza poll numbers. While 13 percent is exactly 13 more than what it should be, 85 percent of polled Gazans said they oppose ISIS. That's awfully high, especially considering that Europeans were much less likely to say they held an unfavorable view of the group:</p> \n<p><chorus-asset data-id=""671700"" class=""chorus-snippet browser_wide_media""> <img src=""http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/671700/Screen_Shot_2014-08-25_at_4.51.37_PM.0.png"" class=""small"" alt=""Screen_Shot_2014-08-25_at_4.51.37_PM.0.png""></chorus-asset></p> \n<p><span>Though Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been arguing that ISIS is indistinguishable from Hamas, the Palestinian group that rules Gaza (</span><a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/8/25/6064467/no-netanyahu-hamas-is-not-isis-isis-is-not-hamas"" style=""line-height: 1.5; background-color: #ffffff;"">he is wrong for a number of reasons</a><span>), it turns out that at least Palestinians in Gaza see a strong distinction. While the Gaza poll did not ask for Hamas approval/disapproval, it did return favorable-sounding results on two questions: ""Was the Palestinian resistance prepared for this aggression [by Israel against Gaza],"" to which 58 percent said yes; and ""do you support disarming the Palestinian resistance,"" to which 93 percent said no and 3 percent said yes.</span></p> \n<p>Again, Gazans and Europeans were asked slightly different questions by different polling agencies, but it is still awfully striking that more Gazans gave the anti-ISIS response than did Western Europeans.</p>",Politics

It should. The world's leaders have been hammering out various climate agreements for decades now. There was the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyoto_Protocol"">1997 Kyoto Protocol</a>. The <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copenhagen_Accord"">2009 Copenhagen Accord</a>.

The talks over the next year could build on that slow progress.</p> \n<p>Expectations are modest for the one-day summit in New York on Tuesday, which was called by UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon. Various leaders are expected to announce a few modest climate initiatives, like a <a href=""http://www.irena.org/menu/index.aspx?mnu=Subcat&amp;PriMenuID=30&amp;CatID=79&amp;SubcatID=343"">""clean energy corridor""</a> in Africa or new pledges to slow the pace of deforestation. But the ultimate prize is an agreement with ""legal force"" that commits all nations to reduce their greenhouse-gas emissions. That's much, <i>much</i> more difficult — see <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/9/22/6805513/un-climate-talks-in-seven-charts"">here</a> for why — and will take until at least 2015 to negotiate.</p> \n<p>So here's a walk through the next 15 months of climate talks — how they'll work, the different possible outcomes, and how the Obama administration plans to approach them.</p> \n<h3>What are the UN climate talks?</h3> \n<p><chorus-asset class=""chorus-snippet browser_wide_media"" data-id=""676540"" style=""width: 626px;""><img alt=""oil refinery moon"" class=""small"" src=""http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/676540/144078375.0.jpg"" style=""width: 626px;""></chorus-asset></p> \n<p class=""caption"" style=""text-align: start;"">An oil refinery silhouetted against the red of a full moon (Photo by Visions of America/UIG via Getty Images)</p> \n<p>Back in 1992, virtually every nation on Earth — including the United States — signed (and later ratified) the <a href=""http://unfccc.int/essential_background/convention/items/6036.php"">UN Framework Convention on Climate Change</a>.

Key details were left vague, like: What actually counted as ""dangerous"" global warming? How much do emissions need to be reduced? How do we divide up responsibility for those cuts?</p> \n<p>In the years since, negotiators have been meeting periodically to haggle over the details. A few of the big milestones:</p> \n<p>— Under the 1997 <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyoto_Protocol"">Kyoto Protocol</a>, the world's wealthiest nations agreed to act first to cut their greenhouse-gas emissions. Europe <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2014/01/23/no-one-tries-harder-than-europe-to-fight-climate-change-the-recession-is-testing-that/"">mostly followed through</a> on its promised cuts. But Canada and Russia later backed out of the agreement. And the US never ratified the treaty in the first place. What's more, the Kyoto Protocol specifically exempted developing countries like China and India — on the theory that they should be allowed to get richer before being forced to act. Now, two decades later, China is the world's biggest emitter of carbon-dioxide, so this treaty has some pretty obvious holes.</p> \n<p>— Under the 2009 <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copenhagen_Accord"">Copenhagen Accord</a>, the world's nations agreed on how to define ""dangerous"" global warming. Basically, they said, we shouldn't let global average temperatures rise more than 2°C (or 3.6°F) above pre-industrial levels. Otherwise, the risks from rising temperatures, extreme weather, and sea-level rise would be too great. (Here's a <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/4/22/5551004/two-degrees"">more in-depth look</a> at the 2°C target.)</p> \n<p>The Copenhagen talks also saw all of the world's biggest economies — including the United States, China, and India — <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copenhagen_Accord#Emissions_pledges"">make voluntary pledges</a> on curbing their emissions. The US, for instance, promised to cut emissions 17 percent between 2005 and 2020. Those pledges aren't legally binding, and analysts <a href=""http://www.climateactiontracker.org/"" style=""background-color: #ffffff;"">found</a> they're insufficient to meeting the 2°C goal. But the fact that pledges were being made at all was a big change.</p> \n<p>— More recently, negotiators have <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_United_Nations_Climate_Change_Conference#Durban_Platform"">set up a new timetable</a>. They want a new climate agreement by 2015 that covers <i>all </i>countries, has some sort of ""legal force,"" and would go into effect by 2020. In theory this would require countries to commit to cuts in greenhouse gas emissions and maybe set up some way for wealthier countries to aid poorer countries in the transition. But the details are still up in the air. They'll officially <a href=""http://unfccc.int/meetings/lima_dec_2014/meeting/8141.php"">get underway in Lima</a> this December.</p> \n<h3>Have the previous climate talks failed?</h3> \n<p>They certainly haven't achieved the goal of stabilizing greenhouse-gas emissions in the atmosphere.

That's well above the hoped-for 2°C goal.</p> \n<p>A related goal of previous climate talks has been ""climate finance."" Back in 2009, wealthier nations pledged, as a first step, some $30 billion in aid to help poorer countries use more clean energy and adapt to the worst impacts of global warming. But that hasn't gone according to plan, either. Critics <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/11/18/wealthy-nations-promised-billions-to-help-the-poor-adapt-to-climate-change-where-did-it-go/"" style=""line-height: 1.5; background-color: #ffffff;"">have noted</a> that a lot of ""climate financing"" is just existing aid repackaged under a new name.

5 reasons politics doesn't fix inequality,http://www.vox.com/2014/8/31/6084185/5-reasons-politics-doesnt-fix-inequality,It's much more complicated than a lack of information,"<p>One of the most longstanding hopes (on the left) and fears (on the right) about democratic politics is that voters of modest means will use their electoral weight to level the economic playing field. In a market economy, the median voter's income will invariably be below the national average creating an apparently compelling opportunity for a politics of redistribution. This makes the sustained increase in income inequality in the United States and other developed countries a bit of a puzzle. One common suggestion, <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/25/upshot/why-voters-arent-angrier-about-economic-inequality.html"">offered recently</a> by Eduardo Porter in <i>The New York Times</i>, is ignorance.

Even if voters perceive the level of inequality correctly, their tendency to overstate the level of mobility can undermine support for redistribution.

That is, higher inequality leads to less demand for redistribution. This is perhaps because as society becomes less equal, its members have less in common and find it less congenial to act in solidarity. Bo Rothstein and Eric Uslaner <a href=""http://conferences.wcfia.harvard.edu/files/gov2126/files/rothstein_2005.pdf"">argue that</a>, ""the best policy response to growing inequality is to enact universalistic social welfare programs.

The real obstacles to policy action on inequality are more deeply ingrained in the structure of American politics, demographics, and interest group coalitions. Insofar as there is a role for better information to play, it likely relates not to inequality but to <i>social mobility</i> which remains widely misperceived and is a potent driver of feelings about the justice of economic policy. As John Steinbeck noted, ""Socialism never took root in America because the poor see themselves not as an exploited proletariat but as temporarily embarrassed millionaires."" Stronger unions, more lower income voter turnout and policies to reduce the corrupting influence of money on the political process would all work to reduce inequality. It will take political mobilization, not simply voter education to achieve change. The wonks have interpreted the world; the point, however, is to change it.</p>",Politics
How political science conquered Washington,http://www.vox.com/2014/9/2/6088485/how-political-science-conquered-washington,Perhaps the single best thing that's happened to political journalism in the time I've been doing it is the rise of political science.,"<p>Perhaps the single best thing that's happened to political journalism in the time I've been doing it is the rise of political science.</p> \n<p>In 2005, when I came to Washington, knowing political science wasn't a legitimate form of knowing about politics, or at least it wasn't presented as one to young journalists like me<span>. </span><span>There were a few reporters who kept up with the profession — the late, great David Broder was known for attending the American Political Science Association's annual convention, for instance — but, on the whole, political journalism dealt with political science episodically and condescendingly.</span></p> \n<p><q class=""center"" aria-hidden=""true""><span>political journalism dealt with political science episodically and condescendingly</span></q></p> \n<p>But that's changed. Last week, t<span>he American Political Science Association held its annual convention in Washington, D.C. It was an appropriate choice. Washington is listening to political scientists, in large part because it's stopped trusting itself.</span></p> \n<p>Political journalists always had an advantage over political scientists: politicians would talk to them. A PhD was nice, but if you couldn't get the Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee on the phone, what did you really know about what was going on in Congress? Political journalists admired the technical skills of economists and the inside knowledge of Hill staffers. But political journalists had better sources of information than political scientists, who <span>were trying to learn about the messy work of people in Washington by screwing around with data sets in their office in Illinois.</span></p> \n<p>But over the last decade, the Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee became an unreliable narrator. So did pretty much everyone else working in American politics. If you spent 2008 and 2009 talking to (then) Sen. Max Baucus you would have believed that health reform would be a bipartisan bill. You would have believed that because <i>he</i> believed that. And he believed that because he had been close friends with his Republican counterpart, Sen. Chuck Grassley, for years. They would work this out.</p> \n<p>They didn't. <span>I remember </span><a href=""http://voices.washingtonpost.com/ezra-klein/2009/09/why_frances_health-care_is_so.html"">interviewing</a><span> then-Sen. Kent Conrad, the then-chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, and a member of Baucus's failed ""Gang of Six."" I asked him why the Gang hadn't come to a compromise. I'll never forget his response.

But that's only benefitted political science because what they've said has been worth listening to.</span></p> \n<p>Political scientists traffic in structural explanations for American politics. They can't tell you what an individual senator thinks, or what message the president's campaign will try out next. But they can tell you, in general, how <a href=""http://voteview.com/senvotes.asp"">polarized the Senate is by party</a>, and whether independent voters <a href=""http://themonkeycage.org/2009/12/17/three_myths_about_political_in/"">are just partisans in disguise</a>, and how <a href=""http://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/T/bo13948250.html"">predictable elections generally are</a>. They can tell you when American politics is breaking its old patterns (like with <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2014/05/15/how-we-count-senate-filibusters-and-why-it-matters/"">the stunning rise of the filibuster</a>) or when people are counting on patterns that never existed in the first place (like Washington's <a href=""http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/03/19/the-unpersuaded-2"">continued faith in the power of presidential speeches</a>).<span> </span></p> \n<p><span>As politicians lose power and parties gain power, these structural explanations for American politics have become more important. </span><span>That's what I've found, certainly. Talking to members of Congress and campaign operatives is useful, but not terribly reliable. Politicians are endlessly optimistic — in their line of work, they almost have to be — and they want to believe that they and their colleagues can rise above party and ignore special interests. But they usually can't. They begin every legislative project hoping that that this time will be different. But it usually isn't. An understanding of the individual dynamics in Congress or in the White House can be actively misleading if it's not tempered by a sense of the structural forces that drive outcomes in American politics. </span></p> \n<p>And so the more that political journalists heard from political scientists, the more they began to listen. Today the Monkey Cage sits at the Washington Post.

There are a half-dozen forecasting models trying to predict the 2014 election — all of which owe a lot to work done by political scientists, and a few of which are actually built and maintained by political scientists. Young political journalists I talk to know a lot more about political science and how to use it to inform their reporting than they did when I came to town.

It's finished.","<p>There are no two words in politics I hate hearing more than ""class warfare.""</p> \n<p>You'd think I'd like the term. For the last seven years, I've been <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/White-Collar-Government-Economic-American-Politics/dp/022608714X"">researching</a> class and politics in America. Class warfare should be my thing. But it's just a huge lie, a metaphor used by elites to cover up the fact that they've already won. The simple fact is you can't have a war when there's only one side. And right now, one class of Americans is almost entirely locked out of our political institutions.</p> \n<p>So don't listen to the class war nonsense. Here are five ways that class actually matters in American politics.</p> \n<h3>1) Our political institutions are packed with rich people</h3> \n<p><chorus-asset data-id=""678610"" class=""chorus-snippet browser_wide_media""> <img src=""http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/678610/MedianNetWorth2012v2-thumb-650x315-11721.0.jpg"" class=""small"" alt=""millionaires table""> </chorus-asset></p> \n<p class=""caption""><a href=""http://www.opensecrets.org/news/2014/01/millionaires-club-for-first-time-most-lawmakers-are-worth-1-million-plus/"">Open Secrets.</a></p> \n<p>To have a class war in American politics, you need two sides. But those two sides don't exist in America's political institutions.</p> \n<p>Here's the not-so-secret truth about America's political system: the people who run it are almost all rich. In January, <a href=""http://www.opensecrets.org/news/2014/01/millionaires-club-for-first-time-most-lawmakers-are-worth-1-million-plus/"">the Center for Responsive Politics</a> reported that the median net worth of members of Congress has reached a record high of $1,008,767. Millionaires make up just 3 percent of the country, but on Capitol Hill, they're firmly in the majority (and in the Senate, they're a super-majority). And Congress isn't alone: millionaires have a 5-4 majority on the Supreme Court and a man in the White House, too.</p> \n<p><chorus-asset data-id=""678614"" class=""chorus-snippet browser_wide_media""> <img src=""http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/678614/women_minorities_congress.0.jpg"" class=""small"" alt=""women minorities congress""> </chorus-asset></p> \n<p>People who work in manual labor and service-industry jobs have made up more than half of the country since at least the start of the 20th century — but they've never made up more 2 percent of Congress. Even as other historically underrepresented groups like women and racial or ethnic minorities have (thankfully) started to make up closer to their fair share of our political institutions, working-class Americans have remained sharply underrepresented.</p> \n<p>And that's not going to change anytime soon. The makeup of state and local legislatures — which tends to foreshadow demographic changes in national offices — suggest that, if anything, working-class representation may decline even further. In state legislatures, for instance, women's representation skyrocketed from 8 percent to 24 percent between 1976 and 2007, and the share of lawmakers who were black or Latino grew from 9 percent to 11 percent. During the same period, the share of state legislators from blue-collar jobs fell from 5 percent to 3 percent.</p> \n<p>You won't hear many candidates or pundits talk about this during campaign season (except perhaps in the <a href=""http://freepressonline.com/main.asp?SectionID=52&amp;SubSectionID=78&amp;ArticleID=32809"">rare elections</a> that feature a blue-collar candidate), but one of the most important ways that class matters in American politics is this: our political institutions — the institutions that make the final decisions about the issues that divide rich and poor Americans — are all packed with wealthy, white-collar professionals. And they're likely to stay that way.</p> \n<h3>2) Yes, the big problems do divide America by class</h3> \n<p><chorus-asset data-id=""678680"" class=""chorus-snippet browser_wide_media""> <img src=""http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/678680/aid_to_poor.0.jpg"" class=""small"" alt=""Aid to poor Carnes""> </chorus-asset></p> \n<p class=""caption""><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/White-Collar-Government-Economic-American-Politics/dp/022608714X"">White Collar Government</a></p> \n<p>So why does it matter if political institutions are packed with rich, white-collar workers? Because class actually does divide American politics.</p> \n<p>Since pollsters started surveying Americans in the 1930s and 1940s, we've known that people from different economic classes have different views about issues like tax policy, the social safety net, and the minimum wage. And of course they do. Your experience of the economy is a lot different if you're the guy making minimum wage than it is if you're the guy paying his workers minimum wage.</p> \n<p>The figure above (from chapter one of my new book <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/White-Collar-Government-Economic-American-Politics/dp/022608714X""><i>White-Collar Government</i></a>) illustrates just two of the many examples that are out there. In the 1950s and the 1960s, people who did manual labor jobs were vastly more likely to say that they thought the government should guarantee employment and a minimum standard of living. Today, workers are vastly more likely than managers to say that they think the federal government should increase aid to poor people. When it comes to the economy, Americans on the top are a lot less likely to support policies that help Americans at the bottom.</p> \n<h3>3) Rich politicians tend to support policies that rich people like</h3> \n<p><chorus-asset data-id=""678738"" class=""chorus-snippet browser_wide_media""> <img src=""http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/678738/55949665.0.jpg"" class=""small"" alt=""Rich people""> </chorus-asset></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Tim Graham/Getty Images</p> \n<p>What's true for people is, unsurprisingly, true for politicians.</p> \n<p>There's an old school of thought that says that it doesn't matter whether rich or poor politicians represent us. Alexander Hamilton once argued that working-class Americans see wealthier people as ""their natural patron[s] and friend[s]"" and that workers know ""that however great the confidence they may justly feel in their own good sense, their interests can be more effectually promoted by the merchant than by themselves.""</p> \n<p>That's a very convenient opinion, especially for rich people. But Americans from different classes don't always have the same interests or want the same policies. Politicians are no exception.</p> \n<p>As with the rest of the population, politicians who spent more time doing working-class jobs are more likely to support progressive economic policies — whether they're Republicans or Democrats, experienced lawmakers or first-term members, members of Congress or members of a city council. Likewise, lawmakers from white-collar jobs — and especially those from high-paying jobs in the private sector — are more likely to support the more conservative policies typically favored by the wealthy.</p> \n<p>Here's one example from <i>White-Collar Government</i>. If you look at the scores the AFL-CIO gives members of Congress based on how they vote on major economic bills, legislators who spent more time running businesses and farms tend to be more conservative on economic issues (even when I control for things like party, constituency, campaign donations, etc.), while those who spent more time doing working-class jobs tend to be more liberal on economic issues — just like ordinary Americans.</p> \n<p><chorus-asset data-id=""678716"" class=""chorus-snippet browser_wide_media""> <img src=""http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/678716/aflcioscores.0.jpg"" class=""small"" alt=""aflcio scores""> </chorus-asset></p> \n<p class=""caption""><a href=""http://go.redirectingat.com/?id=66960X1516588&amp;site=Vox.com&amp;xs=1&amp;isjs=1&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FWhite-Collar-Government-Economic-American-Politics%2Fdp%2F022608714X&amp;xguid=8ed84012766bbc4badb3d23072828283&amp;xcreo=0&amp;xed=0&amp;sref=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.vox.com%2Fvox_entries%2Fpreview%2F5862718&amp;pref=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.vox.com%2Fadmin%2Fentries%2Fedit%2F5862718%3Fcommunity_id%3D441&amp;xtz=240"">White Collar Government</a></p> \n<p>The same thing is true when you look at any other measure of economic decision-making: how members of Congress are rated by organizations (like the Chamber of Commerce), the kinds of bills they introduce, even what legislators say in confidential surveys about their personal political beliefs.</p> \n<p>And it's not just Congress. States where the legislature has more working-class members tend to spend larger percentages of their budgets on social safety net programs. Cities, too.</p> \n<p>Other scholars who have analyzed the differences between more and less affluent politicians have reached the same conclusions. Members with more personal wealth are <a href=""http://apr.sagepub.com/content/41/4/599.short"">more likely to oppose the estate tax</a>.

It really matters that we have such a white-collar government.</p> \n<p>Does that mean rich politicians are evil, corrupt robber-barons? No. It means that politicians are people, too. Like the rest of us, their views are partly shaped by the experiences they've had, including the kinds of jobs they've had and where they've been in our economic system. As John Boehner is fond of saying about his career as a business owner, ""It gave me a perspective on our country that I've carried with me throughout my time in public service."" Politicians from different classes aren't fighting a class war; they just bring a particular class perspective to office.</p> \n<p>But those differences in perspective lead to different decisions about the economic issues that affect all of us, decisions that have serious consequences. Social safety net programs are stingier, business regulations are flimsier, and tax policies are more regressive than they would be if our politicians came from the same mix of classes as the people they represent.</p> \n<h3>4) It's getting harder for lower-income and working-class people to influence our political institutions from the outside</h3> \n<p>Perhaps it wouldn't matter so much that working-class Americans are all but absent inside our political institutions if they had a powerful voice outside our political institutions. But that's not true either. For a host of different reasons, the voices of working-class Americans are getting harder and harder for politicians to hear.</p> \n<p>Unions — which traditionally advocated the interests of lower-income and working-class Americans — have been shrinking for the last 50 years, thanks in large part to government policies that make it <a href=""http://www.cepr.net/documents/publications/canada-2012-08.pdf"">difficult for workers to organize</a>.</p> \n<p><chorus-asset data-id=""678706"" class=""chorus-snippet browser_wide_media""> <img src=""http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/678706/unions_us_canada.0.jpg"" class=""small"" alt=""unions us canada""> </chorus-asset></p> \n<p class=""caption""><a href=""http://www.cepr.net/documents/publications/canada-2012-08.pdf"">CEPR</a></p> \n<p>Moreover, lobbying has become a multi-billion-dollar industry. And that's probably only the tip of the iceberg. <a href=""https://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/"">The Center for Responsive Politics</a> tracks lobbying at the federal level, but even its high-quality estimates miss all of the lobbying activity that happens through loopholes in the federal definition of a lobbyist and all the lobbying that happens in state and local government.</p> \n<p><chorus-asset data-id=""678708"" class=""chorus-snippet browser_wide_media""> <img src=""http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/678708/lobbying.0.png"" class=""small"" alt=""Lobbying""> </chorus-asset></p> \n<p class=""caption""><a href=""https://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/"">Open Secrets</a></p> \n<p>Elections are more expensive than ever.

And all this fundraising takes a lot of time — and ensures that affluent politicians end up spending that time with affluent donors and lobbyists. President Barack Obama spoke eloquently about this in his 2008 book, <i>The Audacity of Hope</i>. ""Increasingly I found myself spending time with people of means — law firm partners and investment bankers, hedge fund managers and venture capitalists. As a rule, they were smart, interesting people, knowledgeable about public policy, liberal in their politics, expecting nothing more than a hearing of their opinions in exchange for their checks. But they reflected, almost uniformly, the perspectives of their class: the top 1 percent or so of the income scale that can afford to write a $2,000 check to a political candidate.""</p> \n<p>The result is a kind of cognitive capture: the problems and opinions of affluent Americans loom large for politicians because they spend so much of their time around affluent Americans. Meanwhile, working-class Americans aren't inside our political institutions, and it's getting harder and harder for them to influence politicians from the outside, too.</p> \n<h3>5) Money and power is good at protecting money and power</h3> \n<p>The problem for reformers who want to make the government more representative of and responsive to blue-collar workers is that their efforts need to pass through our white-collar government.</p> \n<p>Historically, reformers who have wanted to give the less fortunate more of a voice in our political process have focused on a) regulating donations to political campaigns, b) regulating lobbying, c) protecting workers' collective bargaining rights, or d) encouraging lower-income Americans  to participate in politics in routine ways like voting or contacting their elected representatives.</p> \n<p>Getting the money out of politics requires not just a policy that can foil the most expensive lawyers and campaign consultants money can buy, but the raw political muscle to make it happen — something that is nearly impossible to marshal when most lawmakers depend on big money to finance tomorrow's campaigns. (And don't forget about the Supreme Court.)</p> \n<p>The same is true of efforts to promote unions or equalize routine political participation. As <a href=""http://books.simonandschuster.com/Winner-Take-All-Politics/Jacob-S-Hacker/9781416588702"">Jacob Hacker and Paul Pierson note</a>, ""We actually know how to increase voter turnout with relatively straightforward reforms"" like same-day registration and early voting, but those reforms ""have, not surprisingly, failed to gain traction within elite Washington."" Supporting unions and increasing voter turnout aren't rocket science, but they aren't happening.</p> \n<p>And why should they? These reforms ask politicians who are succeeding in the current political system to change that system so they're less likely to succeed in it.</p> \n<p>That's the reality of the political ""class war"": the only people left to fight it are from the class that already won it.</p> \n<h3></h3>",Politics
Obama's rhetoric on ISIS is confused because his policy is confused,http://www.vox.com/2014/9/3/6101495/obama-defeat-isis,There's a deep contradiction at the heart of Obama's ISIS policy.,"<p>For the past few days, President Obama has drawn a lot of criticism for saying that his administration ""didn't have a strategy yet"" for countering the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS). To Obama's critics, it <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/8/28/6080031/obama-isis-no-strategy"">was proof</a> that the president was floundering in the face of a major crisis.</p> \n<p>This Wednesday, Obama said something even more confused — and, more than just a gaffe, it signifies a much deeper tension in his approach to ISIS. He said the goal of US policy against ISIS is to ""destroy and degrade"" the group — but it's not. His administration's actual policy is to manage the crisis, not end it by defeating ISIS outright.</p> \n<p>Obama's rhetoric on ISIS is confused because his administration's policy on ISIS is confused by internal contradictions. On the one hand, Obama really does have long term ambitions to destroy ISIS. On the other hand, he recognizes that this is impossible in the near term, and that the best the US can do is lay the groundwork for ISIS' eventual collapse. This essential tension in American objectives explains why Obama's rhetoric and actual policy on the group are so at odds.</p> \n<p><img style=""line-height: 1.5;"" alt=""The aftermath of a car bombing in Kirkuk, the capital of Iraqi Kurdistan. MARWAN IBRAHIM/AFP/Getty Images"" class=""small"" src=""http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/658994/452657560.0.jpg""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">The aftermath of a car bombing in Kirkuk, the capital of Iraqi Kurdistan. (Marwan Ibrahim/AFP/Getty Images)</p> \n<p>Obama's Wednesday comments, part of a <a href=""http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2014/09/03/remarks-president-obama-and-president-ilves-estonia-joint-press-confer-0"">press conference</a> with Estonian President Toomas Ilves, were awfully incoherent on the subject of America's ISIS policy. First, he said the goal was to ""degrade and destroy"" ISIS. Then, he said the goal was to get to ""the point where it is a manageable problem."" So which is it — destroy ISIS, or manage it?</p> \n<p>A reporter (unidentified in the White House transcript) called Obama out on the contradiction. What he said in response was even more confusing:</p> \n<blockquote style=""margin: 0 0 0 40px; border: none; padding: 0px;""> \n<p>Q    Did you just say that the strategy is to destroy ISIS, or to simply contain them or push them back?</p> \n<p>PRESIDENT OBAMA:  Our objective is to make sure that ISIL is not an ongoing threat to the region.  And we can accomplish that. It's going to take some time and it's going to take some effort. As we've seen with al Qaeda, there are always going to be remnants that can cause havoc of any of these networks, in part because of the nature of terrorist activities.  You get a few individuals, and they may be able to carry out a terrorist act.</p> \n<p>But what we can do is to make sure that the kind of systemic and broad-based aggression that we've seen out of ISIL that terrorizes primarily Muslims, Shia, Sunni -- terrorizes Kurds, terrorizes not just Iraqis, but people throughout the region, that that is degraded to the point where it is no longer the kind of factor that we've seen it being over the last several months.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>In other words, Obama is saying that he wants to, if not defeat ISIS, then roll it back to the point where it can't threaten entire nation-states as it does now. This is his clearest statement yet of his administration's objectives in Iraq and Syria. And it's totally at odds with America's actual policy.</p> \n<p><span>Since ISIS overran Mosul, Iraq's second largest city, in June, the administration has very consistently said that ISIS </span><a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/8/9/5983249/iraq-obama-isis-strategy"" style=""line-height: 1.5; background-color: #ffffff;"">couldn't be destroyed</a><span> unless first there was political reform in Iraq and Syria. That means, at a minimum, a more inclusive government in Baghdad and an end to the civil war in Syria. It also means that the US can't just go in to ""degrade and destroy"" ISIS through force.</span></p> \n<p>There's some hope for Iraqi political reform in the near-to-medium term. But the US can't stop the war in Syria. Until that happens, the world has basically no chance of ensuring that ISIS is ""not an ongoing threat to the region,"" as Obama said. So long as ISIS controls a huge chunk of Syria, it'll be able to <a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/things-about-isis-you-need-to-know/isis-syria"">sustainably fund its violent campaign</a>. Without effective local ground forces to partner with — which the US has in Iraq, but <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/8/26/6067019/ally-assad-bad-idea-isis"">lacks in Syria</a> — no American military campaign to crush ISIS in Syria could possibly succeed.</p> \n<p>The Obama administration appears to agree that it can't solve the ISIS problem without these things happening first — but is also seems to believe, very deeply, that ISIS is too dangerous to be left to its own devices. So the US is hoping that political pressure on Baghdad, and support for some kind of political resolution in Syria, can lay the groundwork for Iraqis and Syrians to do what's ultimately necessary to root out ISIS on their own. The current military effort campaign is designed to temporarily weaken ISIS and buttress the political process.</p> \n<p>That's the nice way of describing the policy. A harsher, but still accurate, description is that Obama strategy boils down to nudging Iraqis and Syrians to decide, on their own, to take the hard but necessary steps to solve this on their own. But since this depends so much on local actors cooperating — and a seemingly magical end to the Syrian civil war — there's nothing like a guarantee that it'll succeed.</p> \n<p><q class=""right"" aria-hidden=""true"">The more America talks about wanting to destroy ISIS, the more Iraqis and Syrians think the US might be planning to take the military and political lead</q></p> \n<p>In either reading, this is a reasonable strategy. It is controversial, and there's nothing that ensures it'll work, but it's something. So that's why it's so problematic to see Obama's comments this week suggesting that the US has a very different, much more aggressive strategy of seeking to ""degrade and destroy"" ISIS. Vice President Joe Biden's <a href=""http://time.com/3264582/joe-biden-isis-iraq-syria/"">comments</a> on Wednesday that the US will follow ISIS ""to the gates of Hell"" did not help.</p> \n<p>This suggests that the administration has two contradictory strategic approaches — that American efforts should be aimed at helping Syrians and Iraqis solve this, but also that the US should immediately and unilaterally degrade the ISIS threat — that can work at cross-purposes. The administration seems to think the latter serves the former, but there's a risk that the US is <span>sending mixed messages to the Iraqis and Syrians. The more America talks about wanting to destroy ISIS, the more Iraqis and Syrians think the US might be planning to take the military and political lead.</span></p> \n<p><span>This creates another danger: that the administration becomes so frustrated with the lack of Syrian and Iraqi progress against ISIS that it seriously escalates American strikes against ISIS, in the hopes of destroying the group on its own. That </span><a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/isis-myths-iraq/us-obama-ISIS"" style=""line-height: 1.5;"">wouldn't work</a><span>.

Obama promised that the US and the other members of NATO (a <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/4/2/5570654/9-questions-about-nato-you-were-too-embarrassed-to-ask"">military alliance</a> that includes most of Europe) would fight to defend<i> any </i>invaded member state, including Estonia, as if it were ""Berlin [or] Paris [or] London."" That is a big deal, meant to deter Russian <a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/ukraine-everything-you-need-to-know/what-is-putin-trying-to-accomplish"">aggression</a> with the ultimate threat: war against the United States military.</p> \n<p>But there was another message in Obama's speech, one that was in the subtext but came through loud and clear, especially to Ukrainians: the United States and NATO will not defend Ukraine from the <a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/ukraine-everything-you-need-to-know/eastern-ukraine-conflict-russia-ukraine"">ongoing Russian invasion</a> pushing across its border. The US is not exactly abandoning Ukraine — it still <a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/ukraine-everything-you-need-to-know/what-are-the-us-and-europe-doing-to-try-to-solve-the-ukraine-crisis"">wants to help</a> — but it is not going to do anything that would force the Russian invasion to stop.</p> \n<p><q class=""right"" aria-hidden=""true"">obama has drawn his red line for russia, and ukraine is on the outside of it</q></p> \n<p>The Obama White House is no stranger to the Ukrainian capital of Kiev, which Vice President Joe Biden visited in a <a href=""http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2014/04/21/305634031/biden-visits-ukraine-to-offer-energy-economic-aid"">show of support</a> in April, shortly after Russia had invaded and annexed Crimea. So Obama clearly could have gone there for this speech, which he announced in response to Russia's mid-August invasion of eastern Ukraine. But he didn't, and that's significant.</p> \n<p>Obama's choice to go to a NATO country and assert that the US will defend other NATO countries, at a moment when Russia <i>is invading a non-NATO country</i>, made it pretty clear that the US is not going to turn back Russia's tanks in Ukraine — or, perhaps, in any other non-NATO country, such as Moldova, where Putin is supporting breakaway separatists, or Georgia, where Russia fought a war in 2008.</p> \n<p><img alt=""2537946752.2.0.gif"" class=""small"" src=""http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/679484/2537946752.2.0.gif""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Members of NATO in blue; the US and Canada are also members (<a href=""http://hommelibre.blog.tdg.ch/archive/2014/03/26/ukraine-la-main-qui-montre-et-la-main-qui-cache-254412.html"">Geneva Tribune</a>)</p> \n<p><span>This does not mean that the US and Europe are indifferent to Ukraine's plight. They have sanctioned Russia's economy </span><a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/ukraine-everything-you-need-to-know/is-the-ukraine-crisis-a-new-cold-war"">repeatedly and heavily</a><span>, sending it to the precipice of recession. They have isolated Russia politically, for example by booting it from the G8. But these sanctions are about punishing Russia to deter it from future invasions, or at best an attempt to convince Putin that invading Ukraine is not worthwhile. But Putin's actions have demonstrated very clearly that he is willing to bear Western economic sanctions for his Ukraine invasion, and the US is not escalating further, so the invasion continues.</span></p> \n<p>The US is taking some tougher steps in Ukraine, but they are not very much. Obama, in his speech, called for ""<a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/04/world/europe/obama-calls-russia-ukraine-moves-brazen-assault.html?smid=tw-share&amp;_r=0"">concrete commitments</a>"" to help Ukraine modernize its military, but it's not clear what he meant, and even if Ukraine were armed to the teeth it would still lose any open war with Russia, which has the second-largest military in the world. So building up the Ukrainian military, while a nice symbolic gesture, will not stop Putin.</p> \n<p>The US is also sending 200 troops to participate in <a href=""http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/09/02/us-ukraine-crisis-exercises-idUSKBN0GX23Q20140902"">NATO military exercises</a> later this month that is taking place, very conspicuously, in western Ukraine. It sounded at first like this was meant to deter Russia from invading further: Putin wouldn't dare strike near the NATO forces and risk war. But it turns out that the exercises are being held on the complete other end of Ukraine from the fighting, 750 miles from the front lines, along the border with Poland, where there is near zero imminent risk of Russian invasion.</p> \n<p>President Obama has set a big, bright, clear red line for Russia's military adventurism: the member-states of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. The country's inside of that line, he insisted, can count on US military support, and that is a big deal. But the countries outside of it, from eastern European states such as Ukraine and Georgia to Central Asian former Soviet republics such as Kazakhstan, are largely on their own.</p> \n<p><i>To learn more about the crisis in Ukraine, read <a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/ukraine-everything-you-need-to-know/""><i>the full explainer</i></a>, and watch the two-minute video below:</i></p> \n<p><!-- CHORUS_VIDEO_EMBED ChorusVideo:54586 --></p>",Politics

In other words, c</span><span>ompared to what the raw polling data currently shows, how </span><span>does each model try to adjust and correct for where things might go wrong? </span><span>""These models are measuring uncertainty in different ways,"" says Nate Silver of FiveThirtyEight. </span><span>""There's a range of legitimate disagreement, and there's also models that are just not done well.""</span></p> \n<p><span></span></p> \n<h3>1) The big difference: Polls-plus fundamentals vs. just polls</h3> \n<div align=""center""> \n<p><chorus-asset data-id=""687662"" class=""chorus-snippet browser_wide_media""> <img src=""http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/687662/AR-SEN_LA-SEN.0.png"" class=""small"" alt=""AR-SEN LA-SEN forecasts""> </chorus-asset></p> \n</div> \n<p><span>Currently, the three models giving Democrats the best chances — Wang's, Daily Kos, and and HuffPost Pollster — all rely entirely on polls of individual races. In contrast, the three models slightly favoring Republicans — the Post, the Upshot, and FiveThirtyEight — balance out these polls with a set of other factors generally called ""fundamentals."" </span><span>As shown above, FiveThirtyEight and the Upshot view </span><span>Democrats Mark Pryor of Arkansas and Mary Landrieu of Louisiana as underdogs, while the polls-only models generally view those races as toss-ups. </span></p> \n<p><span></span><span>The specific fundamentals used in each model differ somewhat, and can include both state-level factors like candidate fundraising and national factors like the generic ballot. </span><span>Right now, metrics that try to account for the underlying political leanings of particular states — like Obama's statewide vote share in 2012 — seem to do the biggest damage to Democrats' chances compared to the poll-only models.</span></p> \n<p><q class=""right"" aria-hidden=""true"">Does including ""fundamentals"" help account for uncertainty — or just add more?</q></p> \n<p>These fundamentals are included to try and balance out uncertainty, particularly in states where the polling averages might not seem so trustworthy — perhaps because polling has been sparse, or has come from firms with poor track records. <span>""Usually, if you don't have that much data and you have to pack too much in, your model doesn't work as well in the real world as it does on the computer,"" Silver says.</span></p> \n<p><span></span><span>But some argue that including fundamentals actually introduces more uncertainty. </span><span>""Because polls are a direct measure of opinion, and fundamentals are indirect, it's generally a risky move to add fundamentals to a measurement,"" says Sam Wang. He argues that his purely poll-based metric correctly called two Senate races won by Democrats in 2012 — North Dakota and Montana — that Silver's model missed. ""</span><span>He whiffed on those two Senate races,"" Wang says, suggesting that Silver's inclusion of fundamentals threw him off. </span></p> \n<p><span></span><span>The modelers who use fundamentals say they've extensively analyzed whether polling-plus-fundamentals models outperform polling-only models at various stages of the campaign — and that historically, at this point, they clearly do. While </span><span>Silver hasn't yet published all the factors that go into his new Senate model, he does say that while his team was making it, ""We discovered that we were putting too much weight on the fundamentals before.""</span></p> \n<p>But these models aren't static. E<span>ven the modelers who do use fundamentals are starting to give polls much more weight, and they'll continue to do so as election day draws closer. The Post's model, which used to be entirely fundamentals, is now ""mainly polls,"" says McGhee. This is one reason why, back in July, the Post predicted an </span><a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/7/23/5924151/will-republicans-win-senate-2014"" style=""font-size: 15.4545450210571px; line-height: 20.4545440673828px; background-color: #ffffff;"">86 percent</a><span> likelihood of Republicans taking the Senate, but it now gives them only a 53 percent chance.</span></p> \n<h3>2) The future's uncertain, but how uncertain?</h3> \n<div align=""center""> \n<p><chorus-asset data-id=""687640"" class=""chorus-snippet browser_wide_media""> <img src=""http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/687640/NC-SEN.0.png"" class=""small"" alt=""NC-SEN forecasts""> </chorus-asset></p> \n</div> \n<p><span>Sen.

But the models disagree sharply on how good her chances actually are. Should she be viewed as a clear favorite or a toss-up?</p> \n<p>The most optimistic results for Hagan are from Wang's model, which gives her <span>an 84 percent chance of victory, and the Washington Post's, which gives her a 91 percent chance. The polls have shown ""a small margin but an extremely consistent margin"" in Hagan's favor, McGhee says, so the Post's model reflects that consistency. ""We looked at the polls in past election years to see when we felt like we could really trust the polls, and we concluded that right about now was when you could start trusting them.""</span></p> \n<p><q class=""right"" aria-hidden=""true"">""i really want to kinda wager them,"" silver says</q></p> \n<p><span>There's another, more technical reason why Wang's model may stand out: he alone relies on the </span><a href=""http://election.princeton.edu/faq/"">median of polls</a><span>. Specifically, he finds the median of the most recent poll from each pollster, estimates a standard error, and calculates a win probability based on that. ""My use of median-based statistics is a way to get rid of outliers,"" he has </span><a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/alexknapp/2012/11/07/election-forecaster-sam-wang-on-the-future-of-polling-and-punditry/"">said</a><span>. ""If the numbers say Obama +1, Obama +</span><span>2, and Romney +9, the right answer is probably Obama +1, the middle value (median), not the average."" </span><span>In contrast, HuffPostPollster and Daily Kos look at every poll conducted in a particular race and fit a trendline to them.</span></p> \n<p>Unlike Wang and the Washington Post, the other four modelers view Hagan's race as a toss-up, matching the views of most political observers. This is partly because they build more uncertainty into their models overall, though they do so in different ways. <span>""Once we have an estimate of where we think public opinion is today, we add random error to account for where the polls could be wrong and how public opinion could change between today and election day,"" says statistician Drew Linzer, who co-created the Daily Kos model.</span></p> \n<p><span>Silver's model also builds in substantial uncertainty, as he described in a <a href=""http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/fivethirtyeights-senate-model-is-back-and-it-gives-republicans-the-edge/"">recent post</a>. </span><span>""Whether a 4-point lead translates into a 90 percent chance of victory or a 60 percent chance of victory is something we've spent a lot of time looking at,"" he says. </span><span>""Some people that have crazily high odds in one state or another, I really want to kinda wager them. But it's good for the science of this for people to have a lot of different approaches.""</span></p> \n<h3>3) Bias in the data?</h3> \n<div align=""center""> \n<p><chorus-asset data-id=""687652"" class=""chorus-snippet browser_wide_media""> <img src=""http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/687652/Screen_Shot_2014-09-05_at_4.24.31_PM.0.png"" class=""small"" alt=""NC-SEN polls""> </chorus-asset></p> \n<p class=""caption""><a href=""http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/2014-north-carolina-senate-tillis-vs-hagan"">HuffPostPollster</a></p> \n</div> \n<p>Of the 10 recent polls of North Carolina's Senate race, 7 are from avowedly partisan pollsters, as you can see above.

Some poll registered voters, while others poll likely voters, and they all differ by sample size. How should modelers adjust for all this?</p> \n<p>Linzer believes that, for the most part, they shouldn't. <span>""Correcting for systematic biases feels more intuitive, but </span><span>how do you know your correction is the right correction?"" he says. </span><span>After a broad analysis of partisan polls, Linzer found that on average they give ""about a 1.5 percent boost to candidates that they represent."" So his model corrects for that but, he says, ""that is the only correction that we do, and even that is relatively minor. </span><span>We don't believe that we know what the corrections that would help are.""</span></p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""right"">As more likely voter polls come out, the polls will seem to shift in a pro-GOP direction</q></p> \n<p>Other models make more extensive adjustments. It's common to <span>adjust for ""house effects"" of polling firms in some form. </span><span>Silver's models have</span><span> </span><a style=""line-height: 1.5; background-color: #ffffff;"" href=""http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/pollster-ratings-v40-results/"">long rated</a><span> </span><span>the accuracy of particular pollsters based on past performance, and his current model does as well. And the Huffington Post's model gives greater emphasis to certain polls. </span><span>""We're using all polls, even the partisan polls, to help determine the trend, but we're calibrating the level at which our trend is set based on the nonpartisan polls that have had a reasonable record of relatively little house effect in 2012,"" says Mark Blumenthal, who runs the HuffPostPollster model with Natalie Jackson.</span></p> \n<p><span>Early in the year, pollsters often measure opinion among all registered voters. But as the election draws nearer, they instead start looking at likely voters — the people they think will actually turn out on election day. </span><span>""Almost always in midterm years, likely voter polls are more favorable to Republicans. We'll soon see a switch to more pollsters using likely voter data, and our model already accounts for that,"" says Silver. Models that don't do so may move in a pro-Republican direction as many more likely voter polls begin coming out. ""A lot of people will see that and say, 'There's a big shift toward Republicans.' They'll misinterpret that evidence,"" Silver adds.</span></p> \n<h3>What to keep in mind going forward</h3> \n<div align=""center""> \n<p><chorus-asset data-id=""650028"" class=""chorus-snippet browser_wide_media""> <img src=""http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/assets/4796088/451921490.jpg"" class=""small"" alt=""Reid McConnell""> </chorus-asset></p> \n<p class=""caption"">(Saul Loeb, AFP/Getty)</p> \n</div> \n<p><span>All of these models will likely converge as more polling comes out. </span><span>""By Election Day, everyone's going to have what's basically a poll averaging model,"" says Linzer. ""In 2012, everyone looked at the forecasts people made the day before the election, saw they were right, and said, 'The nerds won!' Just because the night before the election we averaged a bunch of polls together."" Linzer hopes that the post-election retrospectives take into account not just the night before, but what the models said months in advance. ""T</span><span>hese are forecasting models, they should have some utility now, around Labor Day.""</span></p> \n<p>Still, unless the new polls move sharply in one direction or the other, the modelers attempting to call the Senate outcomes face a very difficult task this year. <span>""There's a lot of competitive races, and those competitive races absolutely matter for control of the Senate. The target we're trying to hit is very small,"" says McGhee. Silver concurred in a recent post, </span><a style=""background-color: #ffffff;"" href=""http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/fivethirtyeights-senate-model-is-back-and-it-gives-republicans-the-edge/"">writing</a><span>, ""This is the sort of year in which there are likely to be several missed calls — it would be a minor miracle if any of the models, certainly including ours, manage to go 35-for-36 or 36-for-36.""</span></p> \n<p>And even though models like these have performed well in recent years, they're still all vulnerable to the possibility of a broad-based polling failure. <span>""The volume of polling is way lower than it was 2 and 4 years ago, and the quality of polling is problematic,"" Silver says. ""The response rates get lower and lower every year. Pollsters have still been managing to get decent results, but sooner or later, something's gonna break."" One particular problem Silver mentions is that ""pollsters tend to </span><a style=""line-height: 1.5; background-color: #ffffff;"" href=""http://votamatic.org/pollsters-may-be-herding/"">herd</a><span>, or copy off each other. Then, instead of having random variation around some mean, you can get weird patterns where you can be right for several elections in a row, and then you might have fat-tailed errors.""</span></p> \n<p><span></span><span>""That does make me really nervous,"" Silver adds. ""M</span><span>aybe it won't be this year, but sooner or later you're going to have a year when things were way off.""</span></p> \n<p><b>Update</b>: Added more information to the section on fundamentals.</p>",Politics

""The reality the President has had to weigh is that we're in the midst of the political season, and because of the Republicans' extreme politicization of this issue, the President believes it would be harmful to the policy itself and to the long-term prospects for comprehensive immigration reform to announce administrative action before the elections.

Republicans rallied around the state of Arizona in 2010, when it passed a law designed to get unauthorized immigrants to leave the state — under the logic that the federal government had failed to secure the border and now it was the states' turn to try. <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://thinkprogress.org/yglesias/2010/05/29/197398/the-problem-with-do-something-governmen/"">Voters supported</a> both comprehensive immigration reform and the Arizona law — because they felt nothing was being done on immigration, and that action of any kind was better than nothing.</p> \n<p>And instead of Republicans in Congress getting on board with broader reform, Republicans who previously supported reform started running away. When <a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/immigration-immigrants-reform-us/what-is-the-dream-act"">the DREAM Act</a>, a bill to give legal status to unauthorized immigrants who'd arrived in the US as children, came up in Congress in 2010, several Republicans in both chambers who had voted for the bill in past years walked away — and the bill narrowly failed to hit the 60-vote threshhold for cloture in the Senate.</p> \n<h3>2011-12: The administration tries to explain to Latinos that it's not deporting DREAMers</h3> \n<p>After the failure of the DREAM Act in Congress, immigration advocates, led by the DREAMers (young people who would have qualified for legal status under the DREAM Act), started pressuring President Obama to take executive action to protect some immigrants from deportation. The administration's response was, again, to <a style=""font-size: 15.5555562973022px; line-height: 1.5;"" href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/5/3/5679042/did-joe-biden-just-leak-a-secret-government-plan-to-stop-deportations"">try to explain to them </a><span>that it was already doing all that it could.</span></p> \n<p>First of all, Obama claimed that thanks to the Department of Homeland Security's policy of ""prosecutorial discretion"" — making some unauthorized immigrants ""high priorities"" for deportation, and others ""low priorities"" — DREAMers already weren't getting deported. ""We aren't going around rounding up students,"" Obama told Univisión anchor Jorge Ramos in 2011.</p> \n<p>Second of all, Obama told advocates, there wasn't anything more he could legally do to make sure that DREAMers were protected from deportation. He accused advocates of asking him to wave a <a href=""http://www.nationaljournal.com/thenextamerica/politics/how-obama-got-to-yes-on-immigration-20120618"" target=""_blank"">magic wand to stop deportations</a> and said the Constitution didn't allow him to do that.</p> \n<p><chorus-asset data-id=""638586"" class=""chorus-snippet browser_wide_media""> <img src=""http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/assets/4400567/99616776.jpg"" class=""small"" alt=""DREAMer protest with sunglasses""></chorus-asset></p> \n<p class=""caption"">DREAMers wore graduation gowns to immigration protests.</p> \n<p><b>Did it work? </b><span>The problem was that ""prosecutorial discretion"" wasn't actually being implemented on the ground — and the immigrant community knew that, because they were seeing the evidence. The week after Obama made that statement, a young woman confronted him at a town hall about education and held up her deportation order. Advocates continued to put pressure on Obama and the Department of Homeland Security to find an effective way to protect DREAMers from deportation. </span></p> \n<p><span>And the advocates won. In June 2012, President Obama announced </span><a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/immigration-immigrants-reform-us/what-is-the-dream-act"">the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program</a><span> — which would allow DREAMers to apply for two years of protection from deportation, as well as work permits.</span></p> \n<h3>2013-2014: The administration tries to explain that it can't expand its executive action to other immigrants</h3> \n<p>In Obama's first term, the legislative failure of the DREAM Act gave rise to pressure for executive action instead. That's the same arc that comprehensive immigration reform followed in his second term.</p> \n<p>As it became clear toward the end of 2013 that an immigration bill probably wasn't going to pass Congress anytime soon, advocates began to pivot back to the administration — asking Obama to protect immigrant parents and workers, just like he'd protected immigrant students with DACA.</p> \n<p>The administration took the same line it took in 2011: that they were already doing everything they could do. DACA was legal, they said, but it wouldn't be legal for them to expand the program to other immigrants, like parents of US citizens.</p> \n<p><chorus-asset data-id=""634384"" class=""chorus-snippet browser_wide_media""> <img src=""http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/assets/4260817/170449348.jpg"" class=""small"" alt=""Protesters with father signs""></chorus-asset></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Immigration protesters call for parents to be protected from deportation.</p> \n<p><b>Did it work? </b>Immigration advocates had heard this argument already, and they'd gotten the administration to back down.

The human cost of Obamaâ€™s delay on immigration action,http://www.vox.com/2014/9/8/6118515/number-deportations-obama-delay-immigration-reform-elections-million,Tens of thousands of immigrants will be deported â€” but that's only part of the story,"<p>This week, President Obama was widely expected to announce new executive action to protect millions of unauthorized immigrants from deportation. But <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/9/6/6113999/obama-immigration-executive-order-after-elections"">on Saturday</a>, the White House said it would push any policy change back until after the November midterm elections.</p> \n<p><q class=""right"" aria-hidden=""true"">millions of immigrants will face at least 60 more days under the threat of deportation</q></p> \n<p>One big question is what this delay will mean for the immigrants who might have benefitted from the change in deportation policies. There are at least 60 days between now and whenever Obama plans to announce his new policy. So what do those 60 days mean for immigrants' lives?</p> \n<p><span>There are two ways to look at this: One of them is to calculate the total number of immigrants who will likely be deported between now and Election Day — and try to figure out how many of those might have qualified for protection (assuming Obama had stuck to his original schedule). The best estimate available comes to about 60,000 people — but it's hard to know for sure, because the administration and its critics have very different ideas about who's getting deported right now.</span></p> \n<p>The other way to look at this is to think about how many immigrants will now be living under the <i>threat </i>of deportation for the next several weeks, instead of being able to apply for protection. Not every immigrant who worries about deportation is likely to get deported. But because the administration has never been fully transparent about which unauthorized immigrants it is and isn't deporting, not being a ""likely"" deportee isn't enough to make any immigrant feel fully safe. Only executive action will do that.</p> \n<p><span>Here's a more detailed breakdown of the calculations involved.</span></p> \n<h3><span>How many immigrants will be deported between now and Election Day?</span></h3> \n<p><a target=""_blank"" href=""http://unitedwedream.org/uncategorized/breaking-president-obama-agrees-deport-70000-people-separate-countless-families/"" style=""font-size: 15.5555562973022px; line-height: 1.5;"">Immigration advocates</a> have been saying that between September 5 (when the delay was announced) and Election Day on November 4, 70,000 immigrants in total will get deported.<b> </b>That's based on the pace of deportations during fiscal year 2012 — the highest rate in US history.</p> \n<p>But it's slightly misleading to use that figure, since deportations actually fell slightly during fiscal year 2013 — which is the most recent year for which data's available. <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/4/9/5575006/2-million-immigrants-have-been-deported-under-obama"">During FY 2013,</a>1,010 immigrants were deported every day.

(Interestingly, the administration's now saying it will announce executive action at the end of 2014 — meaning it will come out around the same time as the year's deportation totals.)</p> \n<p>To make matters even more complicated, the agencies responsible for deportation have had to divert billions of dollars to the <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/6/16/5813482/the-child-migrant-crisis"">child-migrant crisis</a>at the border — and the administration's <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/7/21/5913207/the-questions-facing-congress-as-it-debates-the-child-migrant-crisis/in/5577523"">claimed </a>that they could run out of money this fall. That could mean they end up deporting fewer immigrants than expected, although that's not clear. It's also possible they could continue to apprehend immigrants at their usual pace and put them through proceedings to deport later.</p> \n<p><chorus-asset class=""chorus-snippet browser_wide_media"" data-id=""634610""> <img alt=""deportee shoes"" class=""small"" src=""http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/assets/4266325/162871203.jpg""></chorus-asset></p> \n<p class=""caption"">A deportee boards a plane to his home country. (John Moore/Getty)</p> \n<h3>How many of those immigrants would have qualified for protection?</h3> \n<p>This is where things get even trickier — and it's the crux of the dispute between the Obama administration and immigration groups.</p> \n<p>No one thinks that the Obama administration was ever planning to protect all 11 million unauthorized immigrants in the US from deportation. At most, any executive action would protect a few million people — potentially including parents of US citizens; parents of the young immigrants who've already qualified for protection from deportation, via the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program; and/or spouses of US citizens or permanent residents.</p> \n<p>What's more, in all likelihood, immigrants would have to meet strict criteria to qualify for protection — such as having lived in the US for a certain number of years and having a clean criminal record. (These were some of the criteria in the earlier Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA.)</p> \n<p>So how much overlap is there between this group of people, and the group of immigrants who will likely be deported in the coming months? That question is at the heart of the longstanding disagreement between the White House and immigration advocates that's led to the current push for executive action.</p> \n<p>According to the administration, the Department of Homeland Security is already using ""prosecutorial discretion"" so that resident, law-abiding unauthorized immigrants don't get deported.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""right""><span>ADVOCATES DON'T TRUST THE WHITE HOUSE TO BE HONEST ABOUT WHO'S GETTING DEPORTED</span></q></p> \n<p>Instead, the administration says, it's mainly deporting <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/4/9/5575006/2-million-immigrants-have-been-deported-under-obama"">""high priority""</a> immigrants — those who have committed crimes, have recently entered the country, or were deported and then came back. The number of immigrants who end up getting deported each year, be it 350,000 or 400,000, according to the administration, is just a reflection of how many immigrants deserved deportation.</p> \n<p>Immigration advocates don't put much stock in the administration's priorities — or its ability to control who gets deported on the ground. They believe that the administration is setting targets for the number of deportations per year — and working backwards from there to determine which immigrants need to be deported. And they point out that it's <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/4/9/5575006/2-million-immigrants-have-been-deported-under-obama"">very easy</a> for a long-resident, law-abiding immigrant to be cast as an immigration ""priority"" — say, an immigrant who's convicted of driving without a license (since unauthorized immigrants can't get drivers' licenses).</p> \n<p>If the administration is telling the truth about who they're deporting, then most of the immigrants who will be deported between now and the election wouldn't have qualified for relief from deportation anyway.</p> \n<p>If the critics are correct, it's possible that the administration can just deport recent arrivals from Central America — rather than longtime residents — to meet its targets this fall. But critics feel that, if the administration's record is any guide, many of the immigrants who get marked as ""priorities"" and deported between now and November will be immigrants who, if they'd had the opportunity, could have applied for protection from deportation and gotten it.</p> \n<p><chorus-asset class=""chorus-snippet browser_wide_media"" data-id=""634360""> <img alt=""Don"" class=""small"" src=""http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/assets/4260625/103197928.jpg""> </chorus-asset></p> \n<h3>So which side is right?</h3> \n<p>It's hard to tell — which is why so many immigration groups are pushing for executive action, to make it clear immigrants don't need to fear deportation.</p> \n<p><span>During Obama's first term, the Department of Homeland Security and the White House ended up deporting a record number of immigrants </span><a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/9/7/6116367/obama-immigration-strategy-work-republicans-delay-elections"">in order to persuade America </a><span>that they were being tough on immigration.

What makes DACA different from the ""prosecutorial discretion"" policy, and the reason advocates trust it, is that it allows immigrants to apply for protection from deportation — rather than trusting the administration not to come after them.</p> \n<p>In the two years since DACA was introduced, it's become clear that taking away the threat of deportation has made a huge difference to some immigrants' lives. (Read my<a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/8/18/5999601/deferred-action-obama-immigration-daca"" target=""_blank""> feature on DACA</a> to learn more about this.) And once immigrants and advocates saw the opportunities that DACA opened up, they've been pushing for other immigrants to get those same opportunities — especially because the administration was already saying that those other immigrants wouldn't be deported anyway.</p> \n<p>The reason that Obama's delay of executive action is so devastating to the immigrant-rights advocates isn't that they know that 60,000 people will be deported instead of getting protected. They don't know that.</p> \n<p>But they do know that millions of immigrants are going through their lives knowing that, at any time, they <i>could be</i> apprehended and put into deportation proceedings — and there would be very little they could do. That constant threat has been extended for another several weeks, at least. That's the real impact of the delay.</p>",Politics

And even that's a generous estimate:</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>House members will arrive late Monday with the promise of an early getaway Thursday afternoon, no real work until the Wednesday after that and, if all goes according to plan, a midafternoon getaway on Sept. 19 that will extend until Nov. 12. Discounting the days with a late start or an early ending, Congress may have just four full workdays over the next nine weeks.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Perhaps Congress will add more full legislative workdays to the schedule, but there's no particular reason to count on it.</p> \n<p>You can go too far bashing congressional recess and criticizing the time members of Congress spend back in their districts. For the most part, this isn't vacation. A member of Congress's job is supposed to spend time in their district meeting with voters and businesses and interest groups — that's how they know whom it is that they're representing, and how to represent them. It's part of their job, and they treat it as such. I wrote about this back at <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/07/29/in-defense-of-congresss-summer-vacation/"">the Washington Post</a>:</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>Congress spends a lot of time ""out of session"" because that's the time members of Congress can spend back home in their districts. These aren't vacations. They're work of a different kind.</p> \n<p>As it happens, we have pretty good data on this. The Congressional Management Foundation and the Society for Human Resource Management surveyed members of Congress on how they spend their time. The results were released anonymously, so members has no reason to lie, and the CMF has access to the actual schedules of some members, so they can see if the self-reporting varies wildly from the day-to-day agenda.</p> \n<p>The numbers to keep in mind here are 70 and 59. That's the number of hours, respectively, members of Congress report working when they're in Washington vs. back home in their district. So it's true that your senator doesn't work quite as hard when she heads home. But she's still putting in a 60-hour week. That's not a vacation.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>And woe unto the member of Congress who spends too much time in Washington and too little back in her district: a challenger will quickly seize on that as evidence that the incumbent has lost touch with the voters back home.</p> \n<p>Nevertheless, it's <i>also</i> part of Congress's job to be in Washington trying to build coalitions and pass legislative solutions to the nation's problems. <span>And there are plenty of problems right now: between ISIS and the child migrant crisis and Ebola and aging infrastructure and all the other sundry dangers facing the country, four full legislative workdays between now and November 4 is ridiculous.</span></p> \n<p>The best defense for Congress is that it's not as if they're getting much done when they are working in Washington: this is on track to be <a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/congressional-dysfunction/is-congress-less-productive-than-is-used-to-be"">the least productive Congress on record</a>.</p>",Politics

It's a remarkable M.O. ... I don't get it. I don't get it.""</p> \n<p>Advocates are taking the delay so personally that they're struggling to focus on how to respond. ""It's obvious that all of us in the community, and working on the issue of immigration reform, need time to lick our wounds before moving forward,"" says Ben Monterroso, the director of voter-mobilization group Mi Familia Vota.

If you usually agree with Democrats, you should vote for the Democrat. If you usually agree with Republicans, you should vote for the Republican. And yet general election campaigns — especially ones fought out in states like Maine or Louisiana whose electorates have a clear tilt toward one party or another — are dedicated to trying to obscure this basic reality. You hear a lot about candidates' personal attributes, about their gaffes, about their families, and about their scandals. The Montana Senate race, for example, was turned upside down when <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/8/7/5980053/john-walsh-quits-montana-senate-race-plagiarism"">Democrat John Walsh was revealed to have plagiarized his master's thesis</a>.</p> \n<p>The revelation doubly transformed the race. On the one hand, it reflected poorly on Walsh and forced him to drop out. On the other hand, the fact that he dropped out transformed the race because he had unique personal attributes — incumbency, a military service record — that made him more electable than any feasible Democratic replacement.</p> \n<p>And yet the overwhelming bulk of the evidence is that none of this matters. All you really need to know to decide whether you want to vote for John Walsh or any other congressional candidate is what letter sits next to his name.</p> \n<p>It didn't always used to be this way. As this great graphic from Congressional Quarterly shows, decades ago it was common for large minorities of Democrats in both the House and the Senate to break with their parties on legislative votes.</p> \n<p><chorus-asset class=""chorus-snippet browser_wide_media"" data-id=""691592""> <img alt=""Screen_Shot_2014-09-09_at_4.45.39_PM.0.png"" class=""small"" src=""http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/691592/Screen_Shot_2014-09-09_at_4.45.39_PM.0.png""> </chorus-asset></p> \n<p class=""caption""><a href=""http://media.cq.com/votestudies/"">CQ</a></p> \n<p>Regardless of personal qualities, a Democrat is going to vote like a Democrat and a Republican will vote like a Republican.

These states do not tilt overwhelmingly in favor of one party or another. And since Ron Johnson and Tammy Baldwin in Wisconsin and Rob Portman and Sherrod Brown in Ohio represent the exact same electorate, you might expect to see relatively little partisan divergence between the two pairs as all candidates seek the allegiance of the median voter. But that doesn't happen. Instead, both Baldwin and Brown are staunch liberals while both Johnson and Portman are staunch conservatives.</p> \n<p>The nominations process is controlled these days by committed ideological warriors (political scientists Kathleen Bawn, Martin Cohen, David Karol, Seth Masket, Hans Noel, and John Zaller dub them <a style=""line-height: 1.5; background-color: #ffffff;"" href=""http://www.gvpt.umd.edu/karol/Karol_Theory_of_Parties.pdf"">""intense policy-demanders""</a><span> in an influential article) who form cohesive national networks. Consequently, Wisconsin Democrats nominate people who are a lot like Vermont Democrats and Ohio Republicans nominate people who are a lot like Oklahoma Republicans. Even in an extreme case like Alaska, Democrats put forward a candidate who's more liberal than every single Republican in the Senate.</span></p> \n<p>There's a fair amount not to like about the extreme levels of polarization that this leads to. But one advantage is that it makes voting decisions really simple. Regardless of where you live or who the candidates are, you just find the one that belongs to the party you like better and vote for her.</p>",Politics

"The constitutional amendment that would overturn Citizens United, explained",http://www.vox.com/2014/9/11/6131163/citizens-united-constitutional-amendment-explained,The Senate is debating it this week. Here's how it would work.,"<p>This week, the Senate is debating a constitutional amendment that would give Congress and the states greater authority to restrict spending on political campaigns. If approved, the proposal would overturn not just the Supreme Court's <a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/super-pacs-and-dark-money/what-is-the-citizens-united-decision-citizens-united-v-fec"">Citizens United</a> ruling, but decades of Supreme Court precedent on political spending, going back to the mid-1970s. Supporters are arguing that such a measure is necessary to help reduce the <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/7/30/5949581/money-in-politics-charts-explain"">unprecedented amounts</a> of money being spent on elections, while opponents maintain it would hurt free speech and political participation. <span>Here's what the </span><a href=""https://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/senate-joint-resolution/19"">amendment</a><span> would specifically do.</span></p> \n<h3><span>1) It would allow limits on campaign fundraising and spending for both candidates and outside groups</span></h3> \n<blockquote> \n<p><span>SECTION 1. To advance democratic self-government and political equality, and to protect the integrity of government and the electoral process, Congress and the States may regulate and set reasonable limits on the raising and spending of money by candidates and others to influence elections.</span></p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Since 1976, when the Supreme Court has considered whether certain restrictions on election spending are constitutional, it has taken two main things into account. <span>On the one hand there's the First Amendment right to freedom of speech — which the Court believes includes the spending of money on elections — and on the other hand there's a governmental interest in preventing corruption or the appearance of corruption.</span></p> \n<p><q class=""right"" aria-hidden=""true"">Republicans argue that this is the first time in US history the Bill of Rights would ever have been altered</q></p> \n<p>The Court has ruled that laws capping how much an individual or group can <i>donate</i> to a particular candidate are acceptable, because they help prevent corruption. However, overall caps on the amount any candidate or corporation <i>spends</i> on elections are unconstitutional, because they muzzle speech without specifically preventing corruption. (The court's narrow definition of ""corruption"" has consistently been disputed by some justices in the minority.)</p> \n<p>So the proposed constitutional amendment specifically says that both Congress and state governments can limit the ""raising and spending of money"" meant ""to influence elections."" It lists several rationales for doing so — advancing ""democratic self-government,"" ""political equality,"" and protecting the ""integrity"" of the political process. However, it only says that ""reasonable limits"" are acceptable — so if the amendment is ever enacted, there would undoubtedly be court battles over which restrictions are reasonable or unreasonable.</p> \n<p><span>Republicans </span><a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/7/10/5887645/senate-committee-approves-constitutional-amendment-on-campaign-finance"">have argued</a><span> that this is the first time in US history that the Bill of Rights would ever have been altered. However, the amendment itself doesn't actually strike out any text in the First Amendment, or the Bill of Rights more generally. What it would do is shoot down the current Supreme Court majority's </span><i style=""line-height: 1.5;"">interpretation</i><span> that the First Amendment prevents caps on election spending. Much of this interpretation was laid out in the 1976 case </span><i style=""line-height: 1.5;"">Buckley v. Valeo, </i><span>and it was expanded on by several more recent Roberts Court rulings. B</span><span>ut the interpretation has always been controversial, even within the Court itself — </span><span>the recent major campaign finance rulings have all been 5 to 4.</span></p> \n<h3><span>2) It says corporations aren't people when it comes to election spending</span></h3> \n<blockquote> \n<p>SECTION 2. Congress and the States shall have power to implement and enforce this article by appropriate legislation, and may distinguish between natural persons and corporations or other artificial entities created by law, including by prohibiting such entities from spending money to influence elections.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>In the <i>Citizens United v. FEC</i> case, the Supreme Court held that the First Amendment allows corporations and other outside groups like unions to spend unlimited amounts directly on elections, rather than channeling their spending only through regulated and restricted PACs. The rationale was that limiting spending of this kind would mean muzzling speech.</p> \n<p><q class=""right"" aria-hidden=""true"">The amendment wouldn't reject corporate personhood as a whole</q></p> \n<p>After the ruling, many liberals harshly criticized the idea that corporations should be able to spend money influencing elections just like people do.

Many c<span>onservatives, however, argue that corporations and other entities are merely </span><span>""groups of people joined together for a common cause,"" </span><span>as </span><a href=""http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/387515/liberal-illiberalism-yuval-levin"" style=""line-height: 1.5; background-color: #ffffff;"">Yuval Levin</a><span> put it recently, and that they should therefore be allowed to spend on politics.</span></p> \n<p>The proposed constitutional amendment would <i>not</i> reject corporate personhood as a whole. <span>Though the idea that corporations are people seems intuitively wrong to many progressive activists, my colleague <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/7/2/5860732/six-reasons-liberal-should-like-corporate-personhood"">Dylan Matthews</a> has argued that the concept has proved crucial in defending rights like </span><span>freedom of the press and freedom of association.</span></p> \n<p>Instead, the amendment states that when it comes to ""spending money to influence elections"" in particular, Congress and the states can treat corporations (and unions) differently than people, and even prohibit them from spending money at all. The amendment's logic would also allow <a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/super-pacs-and-dark-money/what-are-super-pacs"">Super PACs</a> to be banned. <span>Note, though, that the amendment would just give Congress the </span><i style=""line-height: 1.5;"">power</i><span> to pass these restrictions — it wouldn't put them into effect automatically.</span></p> \n<h3>3) It states that press freedom will not be restricted</h3> \n<blockquote> \n<p>SECTION 3. Nothing in this article shall be construed to grant Congress or the States the power to abridge the freedom of the press.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>This is a pretty straightforward attempt to rebut concerns that the amendment would allow restrictions of freedom of the press, as Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) has recently argued it would.

Obama has a plan for ISIS in Syria. Itâ€™s the opposite of his old plan.,http://www.vox.com/2014/9/10/6131247/obama-isis-syria,Here's why Obama flip-flopped on trying to destroy ISIS in Syria.,"<p>In his Wednesday night address debuting America's new war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (<a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/things-about-isis-you-need-to-know/what-is-isis"">ISIS</a>), President Obama is going to totally reverse his administration's longstanding Syria policy.</p> \n<p>It won't be billed as such, of course, but we know what's coming. Since the war's outbreak in late 2011, Obama has resisted both airstrikes in Syria and any major effort to arm-and-train the moderate Syrian rebels. But <a href=""http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2014/09/10/obama-reportedly-willing-to-authorize-airstrikes-against-isis-in-syria/"">advance accounts</a> of the President's speech say those two measures — a <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/9/9/6121503/obama-isis-speech-honest"">bombing campaign</a> and <a href=""http://www.politico.com/story/2014/09/wh-seeks-to-boost-syrian-rebels-110792.html"">arming the rebels</a> — are at the heart of his new policy for countering and eventually defeating ISIS in Syria.</p> \n<p>Why the flip-flop? The obvious answer is that ISIS has gotten stronger, so the administration has decided it needs to use more force against the group. That's part of it. But, to a certain extent, the administration's policy is as much an ad-hoc response to events as it is about a rational assessment of what the US can do to defeat ISIS. The rapid growth of ISIS since June has forced Obama into a policy he's long believed would fail.</p> \n<h3>Obama doesn't really think his Syria policy will destroy ISIS</h3> \n<p><chorus-asset class=""chorus-snippet browser_wide_media"" data-id=""666650""> <img alt=""Syrian rebel aleppo"" class=""small"" src=""http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/666650/452516426.0.jpg""> </chorus-asset></p> \n<p class=""caption"">A Syrian rebel stands in the street in Aleppo.

(Ahmet Izgi/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images)</p> \n<p><span></span><span>So why is Obama escalating in Syria anyway? Two major reasons: ISIS's advances in Iraq and the group's killing of two American journalists.</span></p> \n<p>After ISIS swept northern Iraq in <a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/things-about-isis-you-need-to-know/how-much-land-does-isis-control"">mid-June</a>, administration concern over ISIS ramped up. According to the Wall Street Journal, the late June plan to arm Syrian rebels was a <a href=""http://online.wsj.com/articles/obama-proposes-500-million-to-aid-syrian-rebels-1403813486"">direct response</a> to the crisis in Iraq. ISIS was using Syria as a launching pad for its move into Iraq, so the group needed to be countered in both countries if it was to be countered at all.</p> \n<p>Then, in August, ISIS launched a significant offensive against Iraqi Kurdistan. The administration saw Kurdistan as a stable oasis in chaotic northern Iraq, and the fact that ISIS was making inroads there terrified them. So they launched airstrikes to roll back ISIS's gains, which quickly expanded to airstrikes supporting both Iraqi government and Kurdish forces.</p> \n<p>The US military effort was, for a time, limited to Iraq. But ISIS's brutal slaughter of two American journalists, <a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/things-about-isis-you-need-to-know/james-foley-isis"">James Foley and Steven Sotloff</a>, was the last straw. ISIS <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/8/20/6049149/obama-james-foley-isis"">announced</a> the murders were punishment for America's bombing campaign in Iraq. The administration was furious.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""right"">Once the administration decided to destroy ISIS, escalation in Syria became a fait accompli</q></p> \n<p><span>After the Foley and Sotloff murders, Team Obama's rhetoric escalated considerably.

Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel called them an ""imminent threat to every interest we had."" Vice President Biden pledged to ""follow them to the gates of hell."" And Obama himself <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/9/3/6101495/obama-defeat-isis"">declared</a> that his policy was to ""destroy and degrade"" the group.</p> \n<p>Once the administration decided to destroy ISIS, escalation in Syria became a fait accompli. It's obviously impossible to eliminate ISIS without taking it on in both Iraq and Syria. Obama — correctly — believes airstrikes alone can't destroy ISIS without local allies on the ground capable of taking and holding ISIS positions. Since the administration can't really coordinate with ISIS's other enemies — al-Qaeda in Syria or Bashar al-Assad's murderous government — the only option left are the so-called moderate rebels.</p> \n<p>So the only policy that has even a theoretical chance of accomplishing Obama's new objective in Syria is a combination of bombing ISIS positions and aiding moderate rebels. But that's a policy that the president has, for a long time, said was doomed to failure.</p> \n<p><i>Watch President Obama evolve throughout 2014 on ISIS in under 3 minutes:</i><!-- CHORUS_VIDEO_EMBED ChorusVideo:55126 --></p>",Politics

The word ""ideologue"" is a technical term within political science but an insult within American politics.

Nevertheless, i<span>f I keep writing this piece using the word ideologue it will sound like I'm just insulting Republicans over and over again.

We ought to be judged on how many laws we repeal.""</p> \n<p>I came to Grossmann and Hopkins' papers skeptically. Most efforts to outline the differences between the two parties end up being reasons that the author prefers one party to the other, or prove to be descriptions of the parties <i>right now</i> that will change as soon as the White House flips. But Grossmann and Hopkins have amassed some impressive evidence.</p> \n<h3>1) There are more conservatives than liberals but more Democrats than Republicans</h3> \n<p><chorus-asset class=""chorus-snippet browser_wide_media"" data-id=""693252""> <img alt=""liberal conservative gallup"" class=""small"" src=""http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/693252/mabtswnh2kqp0bmq4g9tqa__1_.0.png""> </chorus-asset></p> \n<p class=""caption""><a href=""http://www.gallup.com/poll/166787/liberal-self-identification-edges-new-high-2013.aspx"">Gallup</a></p> \n<p>This is an old finding in American politics, but a powerful one.

They see this not as a puzzle about American politics but as an explanation for why it works the way it does. They note that 73 percent of Republican voters say they're conservative but only 42 percent of Democratic voters say they're liberal. And they note that while voters tend to agree with Republicans on the philosophical questions in American politics (should government be smaller?) they tend to agree with Democrats on the policy questions in American politics (like should Social Security be smaller?).</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""center""><span>73 percent of Republican voters say they're conservative but only 42 percent of Democratic voters say they're liberal</span></q></p> \n<p>The Republican Party, in other words, has a very good reason to base itself around philosophical conservatism, while the Democratic Party has a very good reason to base itself around policy deliverables. And so the Republican Party bases itself around philosophical conservatism and the Democratic Party bases itself around policy deliverables.</p> \n<p>The question, of course, is how to test this: what would you ask Democrats and Republicans to test whether one side was there for the philosophy and the other side was there for the policy? Luckily, pollsters have more or less solved this problem.</p> \n<h3>2) Republicans prefer purity, Democrats prefer compromise</h3> \n<p><chorus-asset class=""chorus-snippet browser_wide_media"" data-id=""693272""> <img alt=""principles vs compromise"" class=""small"" src=""http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/693272/principles_vs_compromise.0.jpg""> </chorus-asset></p> \n<p class=""caption""><a href=""http://matthewg.org/papers/ideologicalright.pdf"">The Ideological Right vs. The Interest Group Left</a></p> \n<p>Since at least 2007, the Pew Research Center has asked Democrats and Republicans whether they prefer politicians who stick to their principles or politicians who compromise. This is a clever way of testing voters' interest in passing policy, as the American political system famously requires compromise to get anything done.</p> \n<p>The chart above shows the results: Democrats consistently prefer politicians who compromise and Republicans consistently prefer politicians who stick to their principles.</p> \n<p><q class=""right"" aria-hidden=""true""><span> ""Republicans have been consistent in their elevation of principle over moderation, regardless of which party is in power""</span></q></p> \n<p>What's remarkable is that held true even when Republicans controlled the White House. ""Though they voiced strong disapproval of Bush, Democrats still expressed a preference for compromise in government — a tendency that has carried over to the Obama era,"" write Grossmann and Hopkins. ""Republicans have been consistent in their elevation of principle over moderation, regardless of which party is in power.""</p> \n<p>That is...extraordinary. Even when a Republican president was facing a Democratic Congress, Republicans did not choose the answer that would have helped their president get more done. And even when a Republican president was facing a Democratic Congress, Democrats did not choose the answer that would have stiffened their party's spine against passing Bush's bills. <span>I would have bet money against surveys showing this kind of stability between Democratic and Republican administrations. This is a difference between the two parties that runs deep. </span></p> \n<h3>3) Democrats are under more pressure from interest groups to pass policy</h3> \n<p><chorus-asset class=""chorus-snippet browser_wide_media"" data-id=""693784""> <img alt=""democrat interest groups"" class=""small"" src=""http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/693784/interest_groups.0.jpg""> </chorus-asset></p> \n<p class=""caption""><a href=""http://matthewg.org/papers/policyredblue3.pdf"">Policymaking in Red and Blue</a></p> \n<p>Another difference between the Democratic and Republican parties is that Democrats answer to more interest groups than Republicans.</p> \n<p>Grossmann and Hopkins assemble studies showing that Democratic delegates at both national and state conventions report more organization memberships than Republican delegates, suggesting that Democratic conventions are the site of more organized interest group activity than Republican conventions. They also note a study showing that more interest groups make endorsements in Democratic primaries than in Republican primaries.</p> \n<p>The graphic above is perhaps the most persuasive evidence of the density of the Democratic interest-group ecosystem: it connects interest groups that endorsed more than one of the same candidate or bill in the 2001-2002 Congress and the 2002 midterm election. So, if the AFL-CIO and the Sierra Club both endorsed Senator Mary Landrieu for reelection and they also both endorsed No Child Left Behind, they get a line. The more shared endorsements between two groups, the thicker the line connecting them; the more total connections any individual group has to other groups, the larger the circle they get.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""center""><span>there are more organized groups asking Democrats for policy than asking Republicans for policy</span></q></p> \n<p>You can see the results. The ecosystem of interest groups making endorsements on the Democratic side is both larger and more interconnected than on the Republican side; there are more organized groups asking Democrats for policy than asking Republicans for policy.</p> \n<p>But Democratic interest groups aren't just more numerous; they're also more persistent. ""T<span>he Democratic Party contains strong links between its electoral and legislative coalitions...The diverse groups that come together to support the same candidates also ally when it comes to passing bills in Congress,"" write Grossmann and Hopkins. ""The Republican Party lacks similar ties between its electoral and legislative coalitions, mostly because few of its groups regularly join coalitions to support or oppose legislation."" </span></p> \n<p>Which isn't to say that the Republican Party doesn't have plenty of interest groups demanding its fealty: the National Rifle Association, the Chamber of Commerce, and National Right to Life all hold enormous sway. Indeed, the relative paucity of interest groups on the right might make the ones that do exist stronger, as Republicans have fewer opportunities to play them off each other. But these numbers help explain why Democratic elected officials feel more pressure to deliver new laws than Republicans.</p> \n<h3>4) Policymaking has a liberal bias</h3> \n<p><chorus-asset class=""chorus-snippet browser_wide_media"" data-id=""693892""> <img alt=""policy changes liberal conservative"" class=""small"" src=""http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/693892/policy_changes_liberal_or_conservative.0.jpg""> </chorus-asset></p> \n<p class=""caption""><a href=""http://matthewg.org/papers/policyredblue3.pdf"">Policymaking in Red and Blue</a></p> \n<p>Democratic presidents talk more about policy, propose more specific policy ideas, and pass more significant pieces of legislation. The numbers are stark. Since 1945, Democratic presidents have put forward 39 percent more policy proposals than Republican presidents, and 62 percent more domestic policy proposals.</p> \n<p><span>""There is a good reason for this asymmetry,"" write Grossmann and Hopkins. ""Democrats and liberals are more likely to focus on policymaking because any change that occurs is much more likely to be liberal than conservative. New policies usually expand the scope of government responsibility, funding, or regulation. There are occasional conservative policy successes as well, but they are less frequent and are usually accompanied by expansion of government responsibility in other areas.""</span></p> \n<p>The chart above codes significant policy changes by whether they expand or contract the ""scope of government regulation, funding, or responsibility."" Policy changes turned out to be more than three times as likely to expand the scope of government than to contract it. This is often true even when Republicans are signing the laws.</p> \n<p>President George W. Bush is a good example. He passed a series of tax cuts which conservatives mostly liked. But his other major domestic accomplishments — No Child Left Behind and Medicare Part D — sharply expanded the role of the federal government in education and health care, and today they're used as evidence that Bush wasn't really a conservative president.</p> \n<p>The cleanest way to shrink the size of government is to repeal laws and regulations. But it doesn't happen very often. In the American political system, Grossmann says, ""it's hard to pass anything, but it's particularly hard to repeal a law that already exists."" Systematic analyses show it's rare for laws to be repealed wholesale. ""<span>That creates perpetual disappointment among the Republican base,"" Grossmann continues. ""They correctly perceive that their party does not succeed in enacting their professed ideology.""</span></p> \n<p>As such, gridlock is often the best small-government conservatives can hope for. And so they're more comfortable with it than Democrats.</p> \n<h3>The parties act differently because they are different</h3> \n<p><chorus-asset data-id=""648518"" class=""chorus-snippet browser_wide_media""> <img src=""http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/assets/4742366/119868648.jpg"" class=""small"" alt=""Boehner Obama""> </chorus-asset></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Jewel Samad/AFP/Getty</p> \n<p>This data only takes you so far. ""Conservatism"" is more than just a preference for small government. Democrats are only somewhat more likely to introduce new legislation than Republicans. As Grossmann told me in an interview, ""these are differences in degrees that are based on a difference in kind between the party coalitions.""</p> \n<p>But they're a reminder that <span>American politics is fundamentally rational. Republicans are uncompromising because compromise tends to expand the scope of government. Democrats are willing to make deep concessions because policy moves in a generally liberal direction. Republicans have a clearer message about government because their message about government is fundamentally popular. Democrats talk more about policy because what they have to say about policy is fundamentally popular.</span></p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""center""><span>Republicans are uncompromising because compromise tends to expand the scope of government</span></q></p> \n<p>The data also explains why Democratic and Republicans have so much trouble understanding each other. Democrats tend to project their preference for policymaking onto the Republican Party — and then respond with anger and confusion when Republicans don't seem interested in making a deal. Republicans tend to assume the Democratic Party is more ideological than it is, and so see various policy initiatives as part of an ideological effort to remake America along more socialistic lines.</p> \n<p>My main objection to Grossmann and Hopkins' argument is that the relationship between the coalition and ""the party"" isn't unidirectional. Politicians can <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/9/11/6131173/legislator-constituent-letter-experiment-broockman-butler"">change the minds of voters</a> just as surely as voters can change the minds of politicians. What counts as ""liberal"" has a lot to do with what various influential liberals end up embracing; consider, for example, the way the individual mandate went from something liberals loathed to something <a href=""http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/06/25/unpopular-mandate"">they supported</a> over the last 15 years.</p> \n<p>It's also worth remembering that these are relative differences between the two parties. Republicans have their policy wonks. Democrats have their ideologues. This data shows the parties are different — not that they never overlap.</p> \n<p>Still, there's much that this data does illuminate. I've often heard liberals wonder why there's no Democratic analogue to the Tea Party. I've often heard conservatives complain that their party doesn't spend enough time coming up with serious policy solutions for issues like health care. And, to be sure, there are some liberals trying to popularize Tea Party-like tactics and some conservatives trying to come up with sweeping new health reforms. But it's hard for these initiatives to succeed. There's a tendency to imagine the parties as mirror images of each other, and so to believe they can easily follow the other's strategies. But they can't. The parties are good at different things because they really are different.</p>",Politics

Here's a breakdown:</p> \n<h3>Democrats could see a drop in voter enthusiasm among Latinos</h3> \n<p><chorus-asset class=""chorus-snippet browser_wide_media"" data-id=""646556""> <img alt=""immigration reform rally"" class=""small"" src=""http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/assets/4680121/183669203.jpg""></chorus-asset></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Immigration reformers are upset at Democrats as well as Republicans.</p> \n<p>""I don't think there's any question that it's going to be harder to motivate and mobilize Latinos in 2014 than it would have been if there had been an announcement [by Obama on immigration],"" says Matt Barreto of polling firm Latino Decisions.</p> \n<p>Barreto points to polling that his firm did earlier in the summer, when they asked Latino voters how they would feel if President Obama decided not to sign any executive orders on immigration. 54 percent of Latinos said they would be less  enthusiastic about turning out to vote, and 57 percent said they would be less enthusiastic about voting for Democrats.</p> \n<p>Barreto says that in 2010 and 2012, Latinos were also frustrated with inaction — but in both cases, decisive moves by Democrats in the months before the election (Harry Reid's attempts to bring the DREAM Act up for a vote in 2010; President Obama's announcement of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program in 2012) caused enthusiasm to spike. In 2014, though, they've missed that opportunity.</p> \n<p><b>Does enthusiasm matter for Democrats? </b>Lack of enthusiasm among Latino voters probably won't matter for most short-term races — although there are a few exceptions. And this could make a big difference in the 2016 presidential election.</p> \n<p>Democrats' main concern right now is holding onto the Senate in November, and most of the states with key Senate races don't have many Latinos. (This fact was reportedly one reason why the White House delayed executive action.) <span>The one big exception here is Colorado, which </span><i style=""line-height: 1.5;"">does</i><span> have a sizable Latino population — and so will be the key race to watch this cycle to test how much Latino anger at the Obama administration actually matters.</span></p> \n<p>Outside the Senate, there are several tight races where Latinos will matter. ""Florida's going to have a super-close governor's election, and the Latino vote will decide that,"" says Barreto. So will Illinois.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, Frank Sharry of America's Voice lists a handful of House races where Latino turnout could matter: ""Think of Joe Garcia in Florida, in one of the most competitive races around, where it's mainly Latino immigrants who vote in the district."" (Other vulnerable Democratic incumbents he lists include Raul Ruiz in California and Ann Kirkpatrick in Arizona.)</p> \n<p>For the most part, though, when Democrats will <i>really</i> need the Latino vote is in 2016, for the presidential election. And as long as Obama keeps his new promise, and takes executive action by the end of 2014, Latinos will probably be willing to forgive the delay, says Barreto. ""There's no question that it's a winning issue for Democrats,"" he says. ""The problem of the delay is mostly a mobilization problem.""</p> \n<h3>In Colorado, Democrats may be able to rally Latino voters anyway</h3> \n<p><chorus-asset class=""chorus-snippet browser_wide_media"" data-id=""693480""> <img alt=""Voter registration Latinos"" class=""small"" src=""http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/693480/57659391.0.jpg""> </chorus-asset></p> \n<p class=""caption"">The ""ground game"" is another way to appeal to the Latino vote. (David McNew/Getty)</p> \n<p>Political scientists agree that a campaign's voter-turnout operation — its ""ground game"" — is at least as important as individual voter enthusiasm, if not more so. ""The turnout is based on a ground game as much as it's based on the policies of a party,"" says political scientist Paul Frymer of Princeton.</p> \n<p>And, Fryer adds, Democrats have been paying particularly close attention to turning out voters in urban areas lately — something that will help them with Latinos.</p> \n<p>The strength of a campaign's voter-turnout effort is partly a factor of how much money it has. But it's not totally independent from enthusiasm. ""The canvassers and organizers have to have something to sell,"" Barreto points out. ""They're talking to voters about the issues. This delay just makes their job harder.""</p> \n<p><b>Does the ground game matter for Democrats? </b>The good news for Democrats is that in Colorado — the one Senate race where Latino anger might be a problem — there's a very strong voter-mobilization effort. ""Our movement, especially here in Colorado, has had a proven track record of turning out voters,"" says Sonia Marquez of the Colorado Immigrant Rights Coalition. She points to the state legislature, which has become heavily pro-immigrant over the past few years.</p> \n<p>Marquez' group is protesting outside the office of Senator Michael Bennet at the same time as they're working to mobilize voters for November. Bennet isn't up for re-election, but he is chair of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee — and Marquez says he's rumored to have had a hand in the decision to delay executive action. (Senator Bennet's office says he did not request the delay.) Marquez admits that Democrats have ""made it very difficult for us to go out in the community and explain this to (Latinos), to try to energize people as to why they should even turn out.""</p> \n<p>But at the end of the day, she says, she thinks what really drives Latinos to the polls is a desire to make their voices heard: ""Even though it's a challenge, we know that voting will continue to grow our power. And I truly believe that that's what's turning out Latino and API voters in our state."" And having a ground game to remind Latinos of that duty certainly doesn't hurt.</p> \n<h3><span>Democrats may look for other ways to appeal to Latinos</span></h3> \n<p><chorus-asset class=""chorus-snippet browser_wide_media"" data-id=""693482""> <img alt=""Mark Udall Luis Gutierrez"" class=""small"" src=""http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/693482/451324856.0.jpg""> </chorus-asset></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Sen. Mark Udall with Rep. Luis Gutierrez--an example of visual leadership to appeal to Latinos. (RJ Sangosti/Denver Post)</p> \n<p><span>When a constituency isn't satisfied with a party's policy record, says Princeton's Frymer, party leaders will often use high-profile appointments to assure their support. Sonia Sotomayor, he posits, is one example of this — an appointee who was chosen, at least in part, in recognition of Latinos' growing influence. </span></p> \n<p><span>Similarly, i</span><span>f Democrats are worried about Latinos in 2016, he says, there might be an opportunity to put a Latino in the vice-presidential slot.</span></p> \n<p><span>Political scientist Robert Preuhs of Metropolitan State University in Denver believes this sort of ""visual leadership"" is important to voters as well as interest-group elites. ""Those types of orientations can offset a general decline"" in enthusiasm, he says, especially during midterm elections — when enthusiasm and turnout are lower anyway.</span></p> \n<p><b>Does visual leadership matter for Democrats? </b>Preuhs thinks that the Democrats are in pretty good shape — especially in Colorado. <span>""There's a new Latino face on the Democratic Party right now. Lots of Latino state legislators. Visual leadership within the Democratic Party is clear.""</span></p> \n<p>But ""visual leadership"" might not always be so good for Democrats. The younger generation of Latino leaders — many of whom are unauthorized immigrants themselves — are leading opposition to Obama and the Democrats for delaying immigration action. ""The DREAMers are the next generation of Latino leaders in this country,"" says advocate Sharry. ""Are they going to be as true blue as some of the current crop of leaders? I don't know. I think this is going to be one of those experiences that it takes a long time to get over.""</p> \n<h3>The Democratic Party may get hurt among Latino voters in the long run</h3> \n<p><chorus-asset class=""chorus-snippet browser_wide_media"" data-id=""693476""> <img alt=""Tu voto es tu voz"" class=""small"" src=""http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/693476/2933327960_c65ed0c718_o.0.jpg""> </chorus-asset></p> \n<p class=""caption"">A voter-registration drive for Latinos in Michigan in 2008.

The big question is how much of that habit has been instilled in the Latino community"" — who are just beginning to become high-propensity voters over the last few election cycles.</p> \n<p>Midterm electorates tend to be less diverse and older than electorates in presidential years — making them much harder terrain for Democrats. Instilling the habit of voting might help offset some of that. And the rapid growth of the Latino electorate, thanks to immigrants becoming naturalized citizens and US-born Latinos turning 18, means that there are plenty of first-time voters this year.</p> \n<p><b>Do voter habits matter for Democrats? </b>This won't be something that shows up in the exit polling in 2014. But Barreto warns that it might delay the ""purpling"" of states that are growing more diverse. ""North Carolina and Georgia have hundreds of Latino registered voters that are just starting to enter the electorate, and (Democrats) are just starting to engage with those voters as much as possible. They could matter in 2014 — they could also matter in 2016."" And beyond.</p> \n<h3>Why does turnout matter, anyway?</h3> \n<p>It's important to remember that none of these factors mean that Latinos will vote more heavily for Republicans — instead, they just might not vote at all. ""It doesn't mean Latinos won't still win 3 out of 4 votes, it just means they're going to be winning 3 out of 4 of less votes,"" says Barreto.</p> \n<p>And because Latinos vote so heavily for Democrats, it would take a huge reduction in turnout to really cut into a Democrat's margin of victory. In Colorado, for example, the most recent NBC-Marist poll shows Latinos at 12 percent of likely voters, and Latinos who have a preference support Udall by more than 2 to 1.</p> \n<p>A quarter of those Latinos would have to decide to stay home in order to drop the net effect of the Latino vote from a 4.5 percentage-point contribution to Udall, to a 3.5 percentage-point one. And since Udall is up by 6 percent in the poll among all voters, even that isn't going to hurt much.</p> \n<p>If Republicans ever made a serious effort to reclaim some credibility among Latinos, Democrats might have a problem. But for the moment, it appears, turnout isn't going to sway an election.</p> \n<p>That doesn't mean that it isn't important. Just because Democrats aren't in danger of losing the Colorado Senate race, for example, doesn't mean they should feel okay with Latinos in Colorado deciding that the political system doesn't care about them enough to make their vote worthwhile. Turnout matters because of democracy, not horse races.</p> \n<p>This means Marquez' group's strategy — turning out Latino voters for Udall, while shaming his colleague Bennet — isn't as much of a paradox as it seems. Latino anger isn't going to do much to hurt Democrats in 2014. But Latino support for the party still helps them in the long run.</p>",Politics
How Barack Obama is expanding presidential power â€” and what it means for the future,http://www.vox.com/2014/9/9/5964421/obama-lawsuit-republicans-abuse-of-power,"Obama's controversial uses of executive power cluster around one main theme: waiving, modifying, or refusing to enforce key provisions in laws dealing with domestic policy.","<div class=""chorus-snippet center""> \n<p class=""s-ecnt-intro"">On a hot day in late July, members of the House of Representatives took to the chamber's floor to make a momentous decision: whether to file an unprecedented lawsuit against the president of the United States. The charge was electric. President Obama, they said, had violated his constitutional duty to faithfully execute the law.</p> \n<p>When the voting closed, the House was 225 to 201 in favor of filing suit. All but 5 Republicans voted in favor — those opposed believed the lawsuit didn't go far enough. Speaker John Boehner chided the Democrats: ""Are you willing to let any president choose what laws to execute and what laws to change?""</p> \n<p>The substance of the lawsuit was soaked in irony: Republicans, taking a break from trying to repeal Obamacare wholesale, were now suing Obama for not implementing the law fast enough. They held that when the administration <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/02/obamacare-employer-mandate_n_3536695.html"">delayed</a> the law's employer mandate last year, it violated congressional will — and the president's own oath to uphold and enforce the laws of the United States.</p> \n<p>The lawsuit was limited to the delay of the employer mandate because Boehner's lawyers believed the narrow charge had the best chance of success in the courts. But House Republicans made clear they believed Obama's overreach was far broader.<span> </span><span>Rep. Andy Harris (R-MD) said the mandate delay was ""only one of the many areas he has abused his executive authority."" And Rep. Doug Lamborn (R-CO) argued that the worst was yet to come, citing</span><span> news reports that Obama was planning new executive actions on immigration.</span><span> ""These are not lawful actions,"" Lamborn said. ""These are the power-hungry actions of a president who refuses to work with Congress.""</span></p> \n<q>""The current argument is about faithful execution of the law, and how much discretion the president has""</q> \n<p>It was a charge that, a few short years before, would have sounded perfectly natural coming from Senator Barack Obama. ""I taught constitutional law for 10  years,"" Obama <a href=""http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2014/02/obamas-long-lost-campaign-promise/"">said</a> in March 2008. ""I take the Constitution very seriously. The biggest problems that we're facing right now have to do with George Bush trying to bring more and more power into the executive branch and not go through Congress at all. And that's what I intend to reverse when I'm president of the United States of America.""</p> \n<p>But interviews with academic, legal, and policy experts make clear Obama has done little to roll back Bush's expansion of executive power — and that, instead, he's added a few innovations of his own. <span>""The consensus is that he's not the disruptor in terms of presidential power that he purported to be,"" says Mitchel Sollenberger, a political scientist at the University of Michigan. ""Instead, he's largely continued consolidating and strengthening it.""</span><span> </span></p> \n<p><span></span><span>Many of Obama's own controversial contributions cluster</span><span> around one main theme: waiving, modifying, or refusing to enforce key provisions in laws dealing with domestic policy. </span><span>And as he weighs a new executive action on immigration, he seems set to go further yet. In doing so, he'll set new precedents that future presidents can cite for even more expansive action. As </span><span>Congressional</span><span> dysfunction keeps getting worse and worse, presidents will keep filling the policymaking vacuum left by the legislative branch — and Congress won't be able to stop them.</span></p> \n<h3>""Faithful execution of the law""</h3> \n<div align=""center""> \n<p><chorus-asset data-id=""654218""> <img src=""http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/654218/84372303.0.jpg"" class=""small"" alt=""Obama swearing-in""> </chorus-asset></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Obama is sworn into office, January 20, 2009 (Timothy A. Clary, AFP/Getty)</p> \n</div> \n<p>Some liberal commentators have scoffed at the idea that Obama has expanded presidential power. They point to <a href=""http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/Blogs/FixGov/2014/06/executive%20orders_logo2.png"">a chart</a> showing the president is issuing executive orders at the lowest rate of any president in the past century. But the raw number reveals little — a single executive order can be extremely consequential, or practically meaningless. <span>Regardless, a</span><span>s Kenneth Mayer of the University of Wisconsin says, ""Most of the Obama actions that have so exercised Republicans have not been executive orders.""</span></p> \n<p>In the foreign policy and security realm, Obama has continued many of Bush's most controversial programs — but those actions, like controversial NSA surveillance programs and detention powers, have since been authorized by statute. <span>""Bush had grabbed these powers unilaterally, but it was then more or less ratified by Congress,"" says Andrew Rudalevidge, a professor at Bowdoin College. ""So Obama can say with a straight face, 'I'm working within statutory authority.' </span><span>He can also say 'I'm working within the laws of war and the AUMF'"" — the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists, passed three days after 9/11 and not yet repealed. </span><span>Obama's escalation of drone strikes, and his legal justification for targeting Americans abroad, are his unique contributions to presidential power here. But</span><span> GOP leadership has shied away from confronting him on those issues — likely because they think a president should in fact have broad war-on-terror foreign policy powers.</span></p> \n<p><span>It's the domestic front where House Republicans have leveled their harshest objections. </span><span>Article II of </span><a href=""http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/constitution_transcript.html"">the Constitution</a><span> states that the president must ""take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed,"" in what's known as the Take Care Clause. </span><span>Many House GOP committee hearings, and much conservative commentary, have honed an argument that Obama has failed to faithfully execute the laws in three key areas: </span><span>waivers to the No Child Left Behind education law, the delay of Obamacare's employer mandate, and the deferral of deportations for young unauthorized immigrants. ""The current argument is about faithful execution of the law, and how much discretion the president has,"" says Rudalevige.</span></p> \n<p><span>Each issue's legal and political specifics are different — </span><span>and for all three, </span><span>even some nonpartisan experts note that Obama's actions have gone further than those of past presidents. ""There are some ways here,"" says William Howell, a political scientist at the University of Chicago, ""in which Obama has made kind of unique contributions, and really extended his executive authority in ways his predecessors haven't done.""</span></p> \n<h3><span>No Child Left Behind waivers: ""A new frontier""</span></h3> \n<div align=""center""> \n<p><chorus-asset data-id=""654208""> <img src=""http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/654208/138579206.0.jpg"" class=""small"" alt=""Obama and Arne Duncan""> </chorus-asset></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Obama and Education Secretary Arne Duncan, February 9, 2012. (Saul Loeb, AFP/Getty)</p> \n</div> \n<p>The authors of the No Child Left Behind Act, signed into law in January 2002, took the law's title quite literally. By the year 2014, the law states, 100 percent of every school's students would have to score as proficient in reading and math on state tests. Schools where this didn't occur for two years would be marked as underperforming and face serious sanctions.</p> \n<p><span></span><span>Most education experts viewed the ""100 percent"" goal as aspirational, and perhaps motivational, </span><span>but not remotely realistic. I</span><span>t was widely expected that this provision of the law would be modified or abandoned by Congress before the 2014 deadline actually kicked in. But that never happened. The Democrats never got around to it when they controlled both chambers, and when the GOP took the House in 2010, NCLB reforms weren't able to break through the gridlock</span><span>. States were starting to get nervous. </span><span>""As it exists now, No Child Left Behind is creating a slow-motion train wreck for children, parents and teachers,"" Arne Duncan, the Secretary of Education, </span><a href=""http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304259304576378104116703210"">said</a><span> in June 2011.</span></p> \n<p><span>So Duncan offered states a way out. </span><span>The No Child Left Behind Act </span><a href=""http://www2.ed.gov/policy/elsec/leg/esea02/pg110.html"">allowed</a><span> </span><span>the Secretary of Education to waive ""any statutory or regulatory requirement""</span><span> of the law for states, local agencies, or school districts that applied. </span><span>This power was intended to allow for some experimentation on the local and state levels, and the Bush administration used it </span><a href=""http://www.law.umaryland.edu/marshall/crsreports/crsdocuments/R42328_06012012.pdf"">many times</a><span>.

Inspire<span>d by its experience with Race to the Top</span><span> — a $5 billion pot of stimulus money that it asked states to compete for by adopting various administration-preferred reforms — it decided to use the waivers to spur further change. </span><span>Adopt the reforms we want, Obama and Duncan said, or we won't rescue you from the NCLB penalties.</span></p> \n<p><span> </span><span>States eagerly applied for the waivers, and by 2014, 42 had gotten them. </span><span>The New York Times </span><a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/06/education/no-child-left-behind-whittled-down-under-obama.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0"">asked</a><span> whether </span><span>the widespread granting of waivers meant No Child Left Behind had been ""essentially nullified."" The Obama administration took the conditions it was setting seriously. </span><span>Earlier this year, when Washington state's legislature failed to approve one of the administration's waiver requirements, Duncan </span><a href=""http://www.politico.com/story/2014/04/washington-state-nclb-waiver-arne-duncan-105997.html"">announced</a><span> that the state's waiver would be revoked. </span><span>The law's penalties would kick in, and what Duncan earlier called a ""train wreck"" would ensue — because the state didn't do what the administration wanted.</span></p> \n<p>Several experts agreed that the waivers alone would have been unremarkable, but that Obama using them to force policy reforms with no basis in the law is something new.<span> </span><span>""He used what was, in my view, a waiver provision for modest experiments and transformed it into a platform for the redesign of the statute,"" says Bruce Ackerman, a professor at Yale Law School. Ackerman believes the NCLB waivers were Obama's ""most troubling"" use of executive power on the domestic front. Howell agrees, saying, ""</span><span>This strikes me as a new frontier.""</span></p> \n</div> \n<div class=""chorus-snippet m-fishtank no-responsive-video""><chorus-ad data-ad-slot=""athena_features""></chorus-ad></div> \n<!--  ########  END SNIPPET  ########  --> <!--  ########  END SNIPPET  ########  --> \n<div class=""chorus-snippet center""> \n<p>But it's also important to note that Obama isn't asserting any new formal powers here. <span>The waiver power was inarguably granted to him by Congress — he's just using it in a way they didn't expect. Furthermore, he's using it to fix a problem that the original law left unsolved. And</span><span> if members of Congress find this offensive, they have the power to change or eliminate the waiver provision. </span></p> \n<p><span></span><span>The problem is that </span><span>a gridlocked and polarized Congress is unlikely to be able to make this happen.

The president spoke for several minutes about how the time had come for Congress to finish the job. But as he neared the end of his speech, he was <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-T_3HUx8E0"">knocked off-script</a> by an activist in the audience.</p> \n<p>""Mr. President, please use your executive order to halt deportations for all 11.5 [million] undocumented immigrants in this country right now,"" said Ju Hong, himself an <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/ju-hong/president-obama-stop-sepa_b_4371244.html"">unauthorized immigrant</a> whose Korean parents had come to the US 12 years ago, but overstayed a tourist visa. ""We agree that we need to pass comprehensive immigration reform. At the same time, you have a power to stop deportations for all—""</p> \n<p>""Actually, I don't,"" Obama said. As activists in the crowd chanted ""Stop deportations! Stop deportations!"" Obama quieted them down, and when security tried to escort them out, he said they could stay. ""If in fact I could solve all these problems without passing laws in Congress, then I would do so,"" he said. ""But we're also a nation of laws.""</p> \n<p>Obama's response left a lot out. While he's always maintained that he can't simply stop all deportations, as Hong urged, he had stopped them for hundreds of thousands of people just the previous year. <span>After Congress failed to pass the DREAM Act — a bill that would have legalized the status of many young unauthorized immigrants who came to the US as minors and had been here for several years — Obama acted on his own, announcing the </span><span>Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program. </span></p> \n<p><span></span><span>DACA permitted DREAMer immigrants to apply for deferral of deportation and a work permit lasting for two years. Their legal status is not permanent, but must be renewed after a new application, and it can be revoked if the program is ended by a future president. (Some wondered why Obama didn't use his pardon power, but it doesn't seem to apply here — </span><span>as</span><span> Suzy Khimm </span><a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/post/no-obama-cant-grant-amnesty-by-pardoning-illegal-immigrants/2011/12/06/gIQA5S53ZO_blog.html"">wrote</a><span> </span><span>at the Washington Post, ""Unauthorized presence in the U.S. is a civil violation, not a criminal one. Presidential pardon power applies only to federal crimes."")</span></p> \n<q>""It seems very unlikely that Congress intended to grant the president the authority to allow millions of unauthorized immigrants the right to full participation in the U.S. labor market""</q> \n<p><span>The administration maintains that its authority for DACA comes from two separate sources. Its authority to defer deportations is based on prosecutorial discretion. </span><span>With only limited resources, it's impossible to deport every single unauthorized immigrant. So, the argument goes, the president can set policy guidance on what top priorities should be. In the area of immigration, presidents have issued </span><span>""blanket or categorical deferrals of deportation numerous times over the years,"" according to a Congressional Research Service </span><a href=""http://shusterman.com/pdf/crsdeferredactionmemo.pdf?3856b4"">report</a><span>. But, the report continues, </span><span>""most of these discretionary deferrals have been done on a country-specific basis, usually in response to war, civil unrest, or natural disasters."" The Obama administration's use of this power to temporarily enact a policy change that Congress weighed and rejected is novel.</span></p> \n<p><span>The second part of DACA — the affirmative granting of work permits —</span><span> needs a separate source of legal authority. </span><span>This authority stems from the </span><a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/01/30/in-1986-congress-tried-to-solve-immigration-why-didnt-it-work/"">1986 immigration reform law</a><span>, which gave the Attorney General the power to authorize certain unauthorized immigrants to work. (This power was later moved </span><span>to the Secretary of Homeland Security in the post-9/11 Cabinet reorganization.) Again, this power both clearly belongs to the executive and has never been used so broadly</span><span>. </span><span>""It seems very unlikely that Congress intended to grant the president the authority to allow millions of unauthorized immigrants the right to full participation in the U.S. labor market,"" </span><a href=""http://m.nationalreview.com/agenda/384659/deferred-action-almost-everyone-reihan-salam"">wrote</a> Reihan Salam of National Review<span>. But, he conceded, ""T</span><span>he statute says what the statute says.""</span></p> \n<p>Now, Obama is planning a new series of executive actions that will go even further in deferring the deportation of many more unauthorized immigrants — though the administration has not said quite how far. Advocates are saying the expansion could apply to as many as 5 million people — nearly half of the entire unauthorized population. But it could also be much narrower, for instance, granting temporary legal status to just parents of DACA beneficiaries.</p> \n<p>Though the White House recently announced that no action would be taken before November's elections, they've said an announcement would take place soon afterward. ""Obviously anything we do will come under intense legal scrutiny,"" a White House official told me. ""So we don't shrug off the responsibility to make sure that it's within the confines of the law, and to be ready to explain how it is.""</p> \n<p>However, the true controversy will likely be political rather than legal. It's widely believed on the right that Obama's DACA program helped cause this year's <a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/child-migrant-crisis-unaccompanied-alien-children-rio-grande-valley-obama-immigration/why-is-the-us-border-in-crisis-because-of-central-american-migrants"">influx of child migrants</a> from Central America. Even Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL), who co-authored the Senate's bipartisan immigration reform bill, <a href=""http://www.newsmax.com/Newsfront/marco-rubio-border-crisis-minor/2014/08/01/id/586428/"">said</a> that DACA ""sent a message to invite people to come."" Opposition to DACA is now widespread within the party, and this summer's Congressional business ended with House Republicans overwhelmingly <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/8/1/5960665/republicans-just-arent-saying-whether-or-not-they-want-to-take-work"">voting</a> to end the program. Rep.

""Until that happens, I'm going to have to make a choice.

Some presidents build entire wings. Others attempt to construct an addition, but see it demolished by Congress. Overall, though, the building grows larger and larger over the years. ""This has been a bipartisan project of building precedent upon precedent,"" says Bruce Ackerman, the Yale Law professor.</p> \n<p>When Obama's administration is asked why it believes it has the authority to take a certain executive action, it often cites a list of precedents — similar actions taken by past administrations. Yet these precedents are usually more limited and less consequential than the proposal at hand. <span>Presidents often cite precedents as a justification for going </span><i style=""line-height: 1.5;"">further</i><span> than previous administrations have done — arguing that since several more minor actions happened previously, a major new one is justified as well.</span></p> \n<q>""I think Democrats are going to rue the day they did not push back against Obama on these things""</q><span>When Obama was unambiguously given waiver powers by No Child Left Behind, he launched the pioneering project of attaching his own conditions before he'd grant waivers. When he had no waiver power at all over the employer mandate, he suspended it anyway. And where previous presidents have suspended deportations and offered work permits to unauthorized immigrants in certain limited circumstances, Obama's already done so for hundreds of thousands of people, with, apparently, many more to come. </span><span>Future presidents could cite all of these precedents to justify their own, </span><span>even more wide-ranging actions.</span>\n</div> \n<div><br></div> \n<div>Howell, the University of Chicago professor, cited one example of how presidents can stretch their powers over time.<span> </span><span>""The president's commander in chief powers started off as a limited authority. What we've seen over the last 50 or 60 years is presidents interpreting that authority broadly, and getting away with it. As a result, we now say, ‘Of course, the president can do all of these things as commander in chief!' </span><span>It may be 50 years hence that we say, ‘Of course, the president can issue waivers as he sees fit.""</span>\n</div> \n<div><br></div> \n<div>The problem for liberals is that there are many laws out there that conservative presidents dearly wish weren't enforced. Indeed, the <span>precedents Obama is setting ""probably benefit conservative presidents who want to stop regulations and have a smaller agenda, to the extent it helps them gain control of the wider executive branch,"" says Rudalevige, the Bowdoin professor. </span>\n</div> \n<div><br></div> \n<div>\n<span>So future Republican presidents will inevitably cite the new precedents Obama is setting to justify actions of their own. </span><span>""I think Democrats are going to rue the day they did not push back against Obama on these things,"" says </span><span>Sollenberger, the University of Michigan professor.

Why hasnâ€™t the class of 2009 grown up?,http://www.vox.com/2014/9/4/6101987/aspiring-adults-adrift-roksa-arum-millennials-academically-adrift,"A new book argues that colleges failed recent graduates, and that's why they're struggling. But the reality is more complicated.","<div class=""chorus-snippet center""> \n<p><!--  ########  BEGIN SNIPPET  ########  --></p> \n<p class=""s-ecnt-intro"">Are colleges to blame for what happened to the class of 2009?<br><br> A study of more than 1,000 members of that graduating class from 25 selective colleges found that two years after graduation, one-quarter of them were still living at home. Thirteen percent had jobs that didn't require any college education. Most were still getting some kind of financial help from their parents.<br><br>Those sobering findings are from<span> two sociologists, Richard Arum and Josipa Roksa, who began studying the students not long after they entered college. In 2010, they published a book called </span><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Academically-Adrift-Limited-Learning-Campuses/dp/0226028569""><i>Academically Adrift</i></a><span>, arguing that colleges were paying too much attention to keeping students happy and too little attention to developing their critical thinking, reasoning, and writing skills.</span><br><br> Arum and Roksa later surveyed the same students about their lives in 2011, two years after they graduated. Their latest book, <a href=""http://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/A/bo19088566.html""><i>Aspiring Adults Adrift</i></a>, draws from those interviews. They argue that students' failure to learn led to a failure to launch. Kids these days are underemployed, stuck in their parents' basements, and overly optimistic about what their futures will hold. And colleges are largely to blame.</p> \n<div class=""chorus-snippet""> \n<p><toggles class=""hide-on-external-post"">story,interview</toggles></p> \n<p> </p> \n<p> </p> \n<story> \n<p>For Arum and Roksa,<b> </b>the poster child for successful adulthood is Beth — and colleges should be trying to reproduce her success.</p> \n<p>Beth went to a mid-tier public university and studied more than 20 hours per week, significantly boosting her critical thinking abilities. She majored in a health-related field and earned a graduate degree. After a few months living at home and more than 50 job applications, Beth found work in her field. She got married two years after graduation, and she and her husband are financially independent.</p> \n<p>But Beth is rare. Almost three-quarters of the students the authors surveyed got some kind of financial support from their parents, in most cases less than $5,000 per year. Just over half of the graduates they studied were unemployed, employed part-time, or making less than $30,000 per year.</p> \n<p>These are depressing statistics, if unsurprising ones; I graduated college in 2009, and they ring true to what my Facebook news feed showed a few years ago. But they don't prove that colleges failed us. We graduated into the worst part of a deep recession. At the same time, the definition of adulthood was changing to depend less on acquiring a spouse, house, career, and kids. Many members of the class of 2009 didn't follow Beth's path right away — but that might not be a bad thing in the long run.</p> \n<hr> \n<div class=""float-right""> \n<p><!--  ########  BEGIN SNIPPET  ########  --></p> \n<div class=""chorus-snippet""><q aria-hidden=""true"">Everyone in the class of 2009 knows someone with a story like that</q></div> \n</div> \n</story> \n<p><story> The people Arum and Roksa interviewed sounded like my high school and college classmates. A business major who partied his way to a 3.9 GPA, then ended up working a delivery job he found on Craigslist, sounded familiar; so did a public health major who was living at home two years after graduation, planning to go to nursing school. Everyone in the class of 2009 knows someone with a story like that. </story></p> \n<story> \n<p> </p> \n<p>These graduates flailed after college because they didn't learn much while they were in it, the authors argue. About a third of students in their study made virtually no improvement on a test of critical thinking and reasoning over four years of college. <i>Aspiring Adults Adrift</i><span> argues that this hurt them in the job market. Students with higher critical thinking scores were less likely to be unemployed, less likely to end up in unskilled jobs, and less likely to lose their jobs once they had them.</span></p> \n<p>That could indicate that there's a relationship between critical thinking ability and career success, and that colleges are failing students by not developing those abilities.</p> \n<p>""Students that advance in college in terms of their general skills, critical thinking and complex reasoning do better in their labor market outcomes,"" Arum said in a recent interview.</p> \n<p>But there's also a simpler explanation: the same qualities that help students acquire critical thinking abilities also make them good employees. A student who skips the Thursday night party scene for an early Friday class probably won't give up after more than 50 rejections for jobs in her field. A student who takes hard classes, even when her major doesn't require them, is also likely to work hard on the job.</p> \n<p>For the class of 2009, the explanation for our struggles seems simpler than whether or not we wrote enough 20-page research papers. We graduated into historically terrible economic times. The class of 2008, which had a few months after graduation before the worst of the recession hit, <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/7/9/5881131/what-happened-to-the-class-of-2008-in-charts"">is still suffering the effects five years later</a><span>. </span></p> \n<p>Roksa argues that the recession doesn't explain recent graduates' woes. ""Unemployment, arguably, yes, there's probably an increase in unemployment relative to other time periods,"" she said. ""But if you look at almost all of the other trends"" — such as young adults who are living with their parents or dependent on them for financial assistance — ""they've been changing for a very long time.""</p> \n<p> </p> \n<div class=""float-left""> \n<p> </p> \n<div class=""chorus-snippet""><q aria-hidden=""true"">Blaming colleges for what happened to recession-era graduates is like blaming umbrella manufacturers when you get wet in a hurricane</q></div> \n</div> \n<p>But the recession dramatically accelerated those trends. The percentage of young adults living with their parents <a href=""http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2013/08/01/a-rising-share-of-young-adults-live-in-their-parents-home/"">grew just 1 percent between 1981 and 2007</a>. Many housing analysts expect <a href=""http://www.newrepublic.com/article/118619/millennials-living-parents-numbers-behind-trend"">young adults will move out as the economy improves</a>, suggesting their motivation was primarily economic.</p> \n<p>Blaming colleges for what happened to recession-era graduates is like blaming umbrella manufacturers when you get wet in a hurricane. <span>Colleges share some blame; my ""adrift"" classmates needed better counseling on majors and more help as they searched for jobs in an economy with few to offer. And the argument that colleges focus too much on the experiences they provide and too little on the education students receive is persuasive, and worrisome. </span></p> \n<p>But in the end, in 2009, we were all drowning in a storm that was beyond colleges' ability to control.</p> \n<hr> \n<p>Roksa and Arum aren't really arguing for a more academically rigorous college education. They did that in their last book. <span>They're fighting the broader idea of </span><a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/22/magazine/22Adulthood-t.html?pagewanted=all"">emerging adulthood</a><span> — that the first half of your 20s is a time to prolong adolescence and delay adult responsibilities.</span></p> \n<p>They find a few recent graduates worthy of their approval. Besides Beth, there is Julie, who graduated from a highly selective college, s<span>hares a house with her boyfriend, gets her news from the New York Times and National Public Radio, and votes in local elections; she also rents out an extra bedroom, which the authors describe not as a juvenile decision to live with roommates but as a prudent financial move. And they praise Michael, who within two years of graduation had earned a master's degree in engineering, married the girlfriend he met the first semester of freshman year, and started thinking about buying a house.</span></p> \n<p>These are some impressive 24-year-olds. But reading about Julie, Beth, and Michael feels like being hectored by a well-meaning relative who wants to know why you can't be like your more responsible cousins. Arum and Roksa set parameters for a successful life that feel awfully narrow.</p> \n<p>The class of 2009 might be optimistic, against all odds, because we imagine adulthood differently. The researchers are diving into a deep generation gap: ""Emerging adults are trying to think about success in a slightly different way,"" Roksa said. ""There's much more of an idea that being an adult has to do with how you feel, with taking responsibility, finding fulfillment, enjoying the journey, not just focusing on the destination.""</p> \n<p>Is a more flexible definition of adulthood such a bad thing? The authors say that it is. They're alarmed that 32 percent of the college graduates they surveyed don't read newspapers online more than once a month, and that 40 percent rarely talk about current events. They worry that the graduates lack a sense of purpose. And they argue that first jobs really do matter: a stint in menial work could hold you back in the long run.</p> \n<div class=""float-right""> \n<p> </p> \n<div class=""chorus-snippet""><q aria-hidden=""true"">The class of 2009 has had no other choice than to redefine success.</q></div> \n</div> \n<br id=""1409773077137""> ""Those early-career, first jobs out of school actually have lifelong consequences,"" Arum said, citing research from the 1960s. While the labor market has changed significantly since then, he said, he hasn't seen convincing evidence that the results will be different for this generation. \n<p> </p> \n<p>The struggles are widespread, but that doesn't mean they aren't serious. ""They look around, most of their peers aren't doing particularly well, so you figure that you're going to be OK,"" Roksa said. ""Because all of you are struggling, and you have a college degree, so good things will happen to everybody.""</p> \n<p>But the class of 2009 has had no other choice than to redefine success. We headed to college in an economic boom, confident that we were special and we would succeed. Four years later, we graduated into the worst recession since the Great Depression. No wonder that two years after graduation we were reconsidering our sense of purpose: Our expectations had been wrong. Our hopes were dashed. We had played by the rules, and it hadn't worked.</p> \n<p>We could have accepted that, by traditional standards, we were failing utterly to grow up. We could have let go of hope that things would ever get better.</p> \n<p>Or we could ask why the old definition of adulthood was so great anyway, and continue to have faith that our lives would be better than our parents' — even if we follow a different path to end up there.</p> \n</story>\n</div> \n<p> </p> \n<interview> \n<div class=""question""> \n<p><i class=""name"">Libby Nelson</i>: Give me a quick summary of the arguments you make in <i>Aspiring Adults Adrift</i>.</p> \n</div> \n<div class=""answer""> \n<p><i class=""name"">Richard Arum</i>: We look at college graduates two years out, and document their difficult transitions they're facing today — in part because the economy is difficult, but also because the broader social and cultural and economic trends are creating these periods of prolonged emerging adulthood where even college graduates are not transitioning effectively.

And not just the financial stuff, but in terms of civic engagement: 32 percent say they read the paper monthly or never, online or in print; 40 percent say they talk about politics or public affairs monthly or never.

The percentage of parents who are dependent on them for financial assistance. And those trends have been on the rise for decades. The conception of what adulthood is has changed. Emerging adulthood is a time of exploration, of learning about yourself, about learning about others, but it's not time for having to make decisions. It's not like the recession will end and these patterns will end. It's a different cultural context in terms of what it means to be an adult.</p> \n<p><i class=""name"">Richard Arum</i><span>: Students are not just going to college, but they go <i>away</i> to college for longer and longer periods of time. Unlike the European system, which costs half of what it does in the US, people go away and leave home and live in dorms or around college campuses to get their education for longer and longer periods. It takes longer to finish college. The number going back to get their masters' is dramatically increased. And so there's this prolonged period when it's socially acceptable to live in what we call ""emerging adult subcultures,"" where it's OK not to assume adult responsibilities. The normative orientations in those communities are not aligned with the traditional notions of academic achievement or even the assumption of adult responsibility.</span></p> \n<p><i class=""name name-alternate"">Josipa Roksa</i>: Which is another reason things won't change. The college experience, which is very focused on the social experience... The students are all about personal development, learning about themselves, learning about others, exploring. That ingrained notion of what college is and what students do, focusing on the social as opposed to academic, that's with us and that's not going to change. That means students will continue to not develop skills such as critical thinking or writing to transition to the labor market, or develop expectations that they need to transition, without changing what college does, what college is and what college emphasizes.</p> \n<p><i class=""name"">Richard Arum</i>: What your general readership doesn't understand is the extent to which colleges and universities have systematically disinvested in academic programs and faculty. So you have a dramatic decline in full-time faculty. At the same time, they systematically have invested in social amenities and student support services, which are the fastest-growing parts of the university today and a good part of the reason why colleges and universities are so expensive in the US. The students are embedded in these institutions which are all about keeping them entertained and satisfied as students and clients and attending to their well-being socially and psychologically, but not focused on the other part of college, which is academic growth and also providing students with more guidance and direction about purposeful paths in life.</p> \n<p><i class=""name name-alternate"">Josipa Roksa</i>: Fifty percent of them, two years out, say they lack a clear direction. That's the question: what exactly are we accomplishing? They're not developing critical thinking skills, but in all this exploration, they're not developing a</p> \n<div class=""float-left""> \n<div class=""chorus-snippet""><q aria-hidden=""true"">In all this exploration, they're not developing a path forward.</q></div> \n</div> \npath forward. Which is a product of the colleges just hoping things will happen — we develop activities and we put students together, and somehow they will just explore and learn and good things will come of that. But there's very little purposeful, thoughtful guidance and structure. We talk about meandering versus purposeful exploration. With all that meandering, there's nothing to show for it. With exploration, there's a path forward, there are ideas about where to look and where to go next.</div> \n<div class=""question""> \n<p><i class=""name"">Libby Nelson</i>: So I'm in this generation. My really big question is: Why is it a problem that it's taking people longer to do things? Was it great that everyone in the ‘50s got married when they were 22? Why should people worry about this?</p> \n</div> \n<div class=""answer""> \n<p><i class=""name"">Richard Arum</i>: In the first chapter, we say students are having difficult transitions but they're very optimistic about their futures. When we ask about their college, they're very romantic and sentimental about the colleges they attended. They feel very loyal. The further they get from college, the more they say they learned in college. So what's the problem? What's wrong here? Is there anything wrong?</p> \n<p>And we come back in the conclusion to say, yes, we think there is something wrong. Colleges and universities have a responsibility to provide better support and guidance to make these transitions smoother. As educators we have that responsibility. If you think about the consequences of prolonged periods of emerging adulthood, for students from privileged middle-class backgrounds, they have the ability to spend five, 10 years in their 20s figuring all this stuff out. They have a safety net and a support system in place where the consequences are not, perhaps it's not the most efficient system, but not particularly worrisome.</p> \n<p>But also there's large numbers of working-class students that don't have that luxury. We have a responsibility to provide, not a narrowing of choices and opportunities, but a much more intentional design of how do we structure the program to better support their academic development and their transition to adulthood, broadly defined.</p> \n</div> \n<div class=""question""> \n<p><i class=""name"">Libby Nelson</i>: Beyond the academic part, what else should colleges be doing?</p> \n</div> \n<div class=""answer""> \n<p><i class=""name name-alternate"">Josipa Roksa</i>: I think there's two things. One is really defining what college is about. If you think about what college is about today, it's about satisfying consumer preferences. And what we argue is that's not the goal of college. That shouldn't be what we are about. There's a big part of it that has to do with redefining what college is about, what's our purpose, and what are we aiming to accomplish as an institution. It's broader than just requiring reading and writing, it's actually fundamentally changing what we do and why we do it and articulating that as a counter-narrative to the consumer narrative that's there now. And providing guidance — how are students exposed to thinking about careers? Do they get internships? In what ways do they facilitate that?</p> \n<p>There are lots of activities, and students are very active, but there's no intentionality. How do we structure our classrooms? How do we structure our extracurricular activities? How do we structure what happens at the university such that the outcomes that students experience are things that we value?</p> \n<p><i class=""name"">Richard Arum</i>: It's not keeping students happy as consumers and clients — not only is it not a worthy goal, but the time we're in the challenges to our country and our world is so great that we need so much more from our graduates and our institutions. 32 percent of graduates don't read the newspaper more than monthly? 40 percent don't talk about politics and public affairs? We've got some serious problems. We don't have the luxury of our institutions not paying attention to these problems. It's not about the labor market outcomes; it's the bigger purpose and function of higher ed.</p> \n<div class=""float-right""> \n<div class=""chorus-snippet""><q aria-hidden=""true"">We've got some serious problems. We don't have the luxury of our institutions not paying attention to these problems.</q></div> \n</div> \nDuring the Cold War, people understood that higher ed had this bigger purpose and function of providing a vision about democratic citizenship and responsible contributions to society. Since the Cold War, institutions have lost their focus and purpose as being anything other than satisfying students and clients. The problems we face as a society, your generation, they're real. We owe it to them to do a better job. \n<p>The differences between college graduates and the rest on reading the newspaper are hardly different. The optimism is really different.</p> \n</div> \n<div class=""question""> \n<p><i class=""name"">Libby Nelson</i>: Maybe colleges are doing this completely wrong, but they do try to put more emphasis on volunteering, on being involved in the community. Does it not produce any kind of lasting effect? Or is that approach not as typical as it seems to me?</p> \n</div> \n<div class=""answer""> \n<p><i class=""name"">Richard Arum</i>: It is typical. Colleges and universities are pushing social engagement broadly and that includes volunteering. But again, it's absent the larger framework about the importance of developing democratic citizens, the importance of civic engagement. They've fulfilled these obligations for volunteering, but there's a disconnect between that and what you'd expect to see from graduates.</p> \n</div> \n<div class=""question""> \n<p><i class=""name"">Libby Nelson</i>: Who's in your sample? Tell me more about who these graduates are.</p> \n</div> \n<div class=""answer""> \n<p><i class=""name"">Richard Arum</i>: We follow 1,000 college graduates, who completed college roughly in time — within four years. They're from 24 diverse colleges and universities, some at the top, we have one college from the top 10 colleges in the US News rankings, but we also have a number of historically black colleges and universities, broad access institutions — it's very, very diverse. We do in-depth interviews with 80, so we have their own voices and accounts and in-depth understanding of their situation.</p> \n</div> \n<div class=""question""> \n<p><i class=""name"">Libby Nelson</i>: Do you see differences from the types of institutions they attended? Is there a difference in outcomes?</p> \n</div> \n<div class=""answer""> \n<p><i class=""name name-alternate"">Josipa Roksa</i>: Selectivity matters, not for income... It matters for unemployment or unskilled employment. People who attend more selective institutions are less likely to be unemployed, less likely to have unskilled jobs. It matters for civic engagement, because students who go to more selective institutions are more likely to read newspapers or more likely to be engaged in politics and public affairs. There's also a relationship between selectivity and romantic outcomes. Educational homogeneity has been very strong, and increasingly college graduates tend to marry college graduates.</p> \n<p>Since we have only 24 schools, we can't slice it many different ways.</p> \n</div> \n<div class=""question""> \n<p><i class=""name"">Libby Nelson</i>: This might only apply to the more selective schools. But for my class, and for my sister's class — my sister is the class of 2012 — it does seem the two years after college are now seen as a sort of gap year. Whether it's teaching abroad or Teach for America or Americorps, there's this idea that what you do for the next two years doesn't affect what you're going to be doing five or 10 years down the road.</p> \n<div> \n<div class=""answer""> \n<p><i class=""name"">Richard Arum</i>: First of all, there's a long tradition of social science research that shows that's not true. Those early career, first jobs out of school actually have lifelong consequences. It's not true, even if people believe it. I do think it's why some measures, like income, are really lousy at getting at different pathways. Income fluctuates wildly, and people are making choices that are not about incomes, often, but are still reasonable choices about career pathways or life pathways.</p> \n<p>That's why we moved, as sociologists, to the characteristics of the occupation: are they in skilled employments or not? Then it doesn't matter whether or not you're in an internship or apprenticeship or low-paying job or Teach for America. The framework we apply doesn't hold that against you. Our measure of skilled occupation is, have the majority of the people in the occupation attended one year of college?</p> \n</div> \n<div class=""question""> \n<p><i class=""name"">Libby Nelson</i>: I'm not familiar with the social science research of those really early post-college years. Can you tell me more about it?</p> \n</div> \n<div class=""answer""> \n<p><i class=""name"">Richard Arum</i>: There's a longstanding tradition in sociology of particular — we've been very skeptical as income as a measure of labor-market outcomes, going all the way back to the 1960s. Sociologists generally have not used income, but have used occupational characteristics - status, prestige. In that work, their key model was what's your first job after school versus what's your job when you're surveyed, when you're in your 40s and 50s? There's a clear association between the job you get right out of school and the job you end up with. That's net of how far you got in school and net of your social background. It's a longstanding finding, and it's true that labor market outcomes have become noisier since the ‘60s. People jump around. But I haven't seen any social science and research that suggests that the first job out of school has no effect on subsequent outcomes. Even in these complex models, it's still a strong predictor of lifelong occupational success.</p> \n</div> \n<div class=""question""> \n<p><i class=""name"">Libby Nelson</i>: So why are young people so optimistic?</p> \n</div> \n<div class=""answer""> \n<p><i class=""name name-alternate"">Josipa Roksa</i>: There is a belief that college is a ticket to a better life. College fosters and helps develop that idea — once you're a college graduate, great things will happen. Students will respond to that. They still believe that a college degree will pay off. It might not pay off right now, but it will eventually lead to good outcomes, because that is what college is supposed to do. They believe that's what it will do.</p> \n<p> </p> \n<div class=""float-left""> \n<p> </p> \n<div class=""chorus-snippet""><q aria-hidden=""true"">They're not altogether wrong in their optimism.

There's much more of an idea that being an adult has to do with how you feel, with taking responsibility, finding fulfillment, enjoying the journey, not just focusing on the destination. Emerging adults have a certain set of attitudes they bring in to project toward the future: I might not be doing particularly well right now, but I am in search of really meaningful work and I'm exploring and enjoying the journey along the way. \n<p>They look around, most of their peers aren't doing particularly well, so you figure that you're going to be OK.

Experts: Obamaâ€™s legal justification for the war on ISIS is â€œa stretchâ€,http://www.vox.com/iraq-crisis/2014/9/12/6134159/is-obamas-new-isis-strategy-legal,The problems with President Obama's claim that a 2001 law gave him the authority to bomb ISIS.,"<p>In his speech on September 10, President Obama laid out a <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/9/10/6132815/obama-isis-syria-iraq-war-strategy"">new strategy</a> for dealing with the terrorist group <a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/things-about-isis-you-need-to-know/what-is-isis"">ISIS</a> (also known as ISIL) in Iraq and Syria. The most notable element of the newly announced plan is expanded military action: The US will conduct a ""systematic campaign"" of airstrikes against ISIS in both countries.</p> \n<p>One problem: The president doesn't have unlimited power to wage war as he pleases. He needs to have authority from the Constitution, Congress, or both in order for military action to be legal. The Obama administration claims that its actions against ISIS are within the bounds of the law — but the rationale is shaky at best.</p> \n<p>On a press call prior to Obama's speech, a senior administration official said that the president has ""constitutional and statutory authority to deal with the threat posed by ISIL"" and that the administration believes that the 2001 Authorization for the Use of Military Force, or AUMF, gives the president the authority to conduct military operations against ISIS without further congressional approval.</p> \n<p>In an email to <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/11/obama-isis-syria-air-strikes-legal-argument"">the Guardian's</a> Spencer Ackerman, a different official expanded on the administration's reasoning:</p> \n<blockquote>""Based on ISIL’s longstanding relationship with al-Qa’ida (AQ) and Usama bin Laden; its long history of conducting, and continued desire to conduct, attacks against U.S. persons and interests, the extensive history of U.S. combat operations against Isil dating back to the time the group first affiliated with AQ in 2004; and Isil’s position - supported by some individual members and factions of AQ-aligned groups - that it is the true inheritor of Usama bin Laden’s legacy, the President may rely on the 2001 AUMF as statutory authority for the use of force against Isil, notwithstanding the recent public split between AQ’s senior leadership and Isil. \n<p> </p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>In the <a href=""http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-107publ40/html/PLAW-107publ40.htm"" style=""line-height: 1.5; background-color: #ffffff;"">2001 AUMF</a>, Congress authorized then-President George W. Bush to ""use all necessary and appropriate force against those nations, organizations, or persons he determines planned, authorized, committed, or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11, 2001, or harbored such organizations or persons,<b> </b>in order to prevent any future acts of international terrorism against the United States by such nations, organizations or persons.""

In 2004 the group swore allegiance to al-Qaeda and became known as al-Qaeda in Iraq. However, they have since split again. In February 2014, al-Qaeda announced that it had severed ties with ISIS.</p> \n<p>Even if the AUMF's exclusively past-tense language (""planned,"" ""authorized,"" ""committed,"" ""aided,"" ""harbored"") can be interpreted to include al-Qaeda's future collaborators as well as its past ones, the administration is going even further here and interpreting the AUMF as a granting the president unlimited authority to use force against a group that is no longer assisting al-Qaeda and is now its rival.</p> \n<p>Essentially, the administration is arguing that the 2001 AUMF authorizes the president to go to war against any organization that ever temporarily worked with al-Qaeda, even if the group in question didn't actually exist in 2001, and even if any subsequent collaboration has turned to enmity by the time the US takes military action.</p> \n<p>Legal scholars have been quick to condemn the administration's reasoning. Writing in <a href=""http://opiniojuris.org/2014/09/11/911-aumf-cover-isis/"">Opinio Juris</a>, Cornell University Law School professor Jens David Ohlin concluded flatly that ""the 9/11 AUMF does not cover ISIS,"" noting that, although ISIS is arguably the ""gravest Jihadist threat to the peaceful world — a position once held by Osama Bin Laden,"" that does not mean that ISIS fits into one of the AUMF's categories for allowable targets.</p> \n<p>Cardozo School of Law's Deborah Pearlstein, also writing<span> in </span><a href=""http://opiniojuris.org/2014/09/11/legal/"">Opinio Juris</a><span>,</span><span> agreed that the AUMF ""does not plausibly extend to ISIL.""

Surely,"" she wrote. ""Has it 'entered the fight alongside al-Qaeda'? Absolutely not. Al-Qaeda and ISIL are fighting each other."" American University's Jennifer Daskal, writing in <a href=""http://justsecurity.org/14820/democracys-failure/"">Just Security</a>, likewise took issue with the inclusion of ISIS within the ""associated forces"" category, declaring it ""to say it mildly, a stretch.""</p> \n<h3>This same argument could be used to justify war in Indonesia and Nigeria</h3> \n<p><chorus-asset data-id=""694400"" class=""chorus-snippet browser_wide_media""> <img src=""http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/694400/Peshmerga_fighter_Mosul.0.jpg"" class=""small"" alt=""Peshmerga fighter Mosul""> </chorus-asset></p> \n<p class=""caption"">A peshmerga fighter in Mosul, Iraq (Feriq Ferec/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images)</p> \n<p><span>The authority that the Obama administration is claiming here is incredibly expansive.

Report: deportations way down during Obamaâ€™s second term,http://www.vox.com/2014/9/11/6136757/deportations-2014-obama-decrease-amnesty-immigrants,New stats say 23 percent fewer immigrants are getting deported than in 2012. Here's why that might be happening â€” and how much to trust the stats,"<p>Deportations have declined significantly since last fall, continuing a two-year trend, according to the <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://bigstory.ap.org/article/apnewsbreak-us-sharply-cutting-deportations"">Associated Press</a>. Citing internal Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) documents, the AP reports that <span>258,608 immigrants were deported </span><span>between October 1, 2013, and July 28, 2014 — a rate of about 862 per day. </span></p> \n<p><span>If ICE stays on that pace through September 30 of this year, it will mean a 15 percent decrease in deportations since 2013, when 1,010 immigrants a day were deported. Furthermore, deportations would be down 23 percent since 2012, when a record 409,849 immigrants were deported — a rate of 1,120 per day.</span></p> \n<h3>How reliable are these numbers?</h3> \n<p>It's not clear. ICE doesn't release its own numbers to the public anymore until a few months after the end of each fiscal year, and preliminary reports to the press during the fiscal year can be off the mark. Because the AP says it got its information from internal government documents, it's probable that these are the same numbers ICE itself is using. But even then, ICE often goes back and adjusts numbers retroactively — even from one year to the next.</p> \n<p>The numbers should be taken seriously  — but with a grain of salt.</p> \n<p><chorus-asset data-id=""641968"" class=""chorus-snippet browser_wide_media""> <img src=""http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/assets/4519531/450371271.jpg"" class=""small"" alt=""child hugging detainee father""> </chorus-asset></p> \n<h3><span>Why have deportations declined?</span></h3> \n<p>The AP report cites two factors — but there are probably four:</p> \n<p><b>1. The Obama administration's policy of ""prosecutorial discretion."" </b>In 2010 and 2011, the Department of Homeland Security issued a series of memos instructing agents to focus on certain kinds of unauthorized immigrants — which it called ""high-priority"" deportations — and try not to deport long-resident unauthorized immigrants and parents of US citizens.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""right"">dhs might be continuing to target some immigrants — and avoid others</q></p> \n<p>Exactly how successful the memos were in protecting ""low-priority"" immigrants is <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/4/9/5575006/2-million-immigrants-have-been-deported-under-obama"">a matter of dispute</a> (which is why immigrant-rights advocates are pushing for the Obama administration to let immigrants apply directly for protection from deportation, rather than hoping DHS doesn't decide to deport them). But numbers released by ICE in recent years indicate that the overwhelming majority of deportees fall into one of the priority categories. And ICE numbers from last year showed the majority of immigrants were deported from the border region (the 100 miles past the border itself) and not from the interior of the US.</p> \n<p>The new statistics might indicate that DHS is continuing to target particular groups for deportation — immigrants who are apprehended at or near the border and immigrants who have been convicted of crimes — and avoiding the deportation of longtime residents who haven't committed crimes.</p> \n<p><b>2. The massive backlog in immigration courts. </b>Before most immigrants can be deported, they have a right to a hearing in immigration court, where a judge makes sure they're not eligible for legal status. But immigration courts are hugely under-resourced, and it takes <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/9/5/6111145/immigration-court-backlog-wait-border-crisis"">a year or two</a> for a case to make it through. <span>Some of the decline in people ultimately getting deported could be attributed to the bottleneck in the middle of the process.</span></p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""right"">some of the decline in people ultimately being deported could be attributed to a bottleneck in the process</q></p> \n<p>Data shows that the immigration court slowdown is particularly affecting immigrants in the interior, without criminal records — exactly the same immigrants the government isn't supposed to be deporting anyway. Immigrants who are apprehended at the border don't usually go through immigration court. Ac<span>cording to new data from the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University, 80 percent of immigrants who've gotten a deportation order from an immigration judge this year have been deported because of their immigration status. Only 20 percent were ordered deported for committing a separate crime.</span></p> \n<p>So the government might be putting more energy into deporting immigrants on the border and immigrants who've committed crimes — people they can deport without sending them through the clogged immigration court system. Meanwhile, when immigration agents <i>do</i> try to deport an immigrant who's been living in the US without committing any crimes, the immigrant's getting stuck in a months- or years-long immigration court backlog.</p> \n<p><chorus-asset data-id=""640138"" class=""chorus-snippet browser_wide_media""> <img src=""http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/assets/4455041/161083112.jpg"" class=""small"" alt=""immigrants in federal jail""> </chorus-asset></p> \n<p><b>3. More immigrants serving time in federal prison before being deported. </b>Immigrants who are caught at the border continue to get charged in federal criminal court with illegal entry or illegal reentry at high rates. (They're the two <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/5/15/5714702/thousands-of-immigrants-the-obama-administration-wants-to-protect-are"">most common charges </a>in the entire federal court system.) Once convicted, they're obligated to serve a prison term before being deported. That's another factor that could be slowing down the process.</p> \n<p><b>4. The child and family migrant crisis. </b>It's almost certain that <a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/child-migrant-crisis-unaccompanied-alien-children-rio-grande-valley-obama-immigration/why-is-the-us-border-in-crisis-because-of-central-american-migrants"">the crisis</a> of children and families entering the US from Central America this spring and summer, which overwhelmed the government's resources, had <i>some </i>effect on deportations. But it's difficult to say exactly what it was — especially because these numbers only go through July 28.</p> \n<p>The AP says that it takes longer to deport immigrants from Central America than it does from Mexico, because the government has to arrange plane flights. Another factor is probably that there's a separate legal process for dealing with unaccompanied children, that prevents them from being deported quickly — and that many families are likely seeking asylum in the US, which also entitles them to more due process before they're deported. (There are reports that the government is <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/8/6/5971003/artesia-immigrants-detention-due-process-families-lawyers-asylum-court-border"">curtailing due process</a> for families to get them deported more quickly.)</p> \n<p>This doesn't mean that immigrants from Mexico, or immigrant adults, aren't still being apprehended while crossing the border. But the government might not have the resources to formally deport those immigrants — they might be getting returned instead, just like immigrants from Mexico were under George W. Bush.</p> \n<h3>Are deportations going to pick up in the last months of the fiscal year?<br>\n</h3> \n<p>It's hard to say — mostly because of the impact of the child and family migrant crisis. The government started making an effort to deport families back to Central America in late July — right when this dataset ends. That could mean that deportations are happening at a faster pace right now than they were when the AP got the numbers. S<span>ince fewer children and families are coming into the US than came in spring and early summer, the government might have more resources available for deportation. </span></p> \n<p><span>On the other hand, government officials warned this summer that the agencies responsible for immigration enforcement were strapped for resources because of the migrant crisis — and were on pace to run out of money entirely by the end of September. That might be constraining the pace of deportations as well.</span></p> \n<h3>Does this mean that Obama doesn't need to do anything via executive action?</h3> \n<p><chorus-asset data-id=""654198"" class=""chorus-snippet browser_wide_media""> <img src=""http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/654198/452977410.0.jpg"" class=""small"" alt=""Stop the deportations protest""> </chorus-asset></p> \n<p class=""caption"">A protest in front of the White House, July 31, 2014 (Karen Bleier, AFP/Getty)</p> \n<p>This is another piece of evidence that, after setting records for deportations during Obama's first term, the government really is making an effort to deport fewer longtime residents and family members.

Given how tough those wars have been for the United States, that's an incredibly high bar.

But there are three really important features of the ISIS crisis that make it especially complicated. Each can be represented, simply, in one number. So here are three numbers that explain the ISIS crisis — and why it's so, so difficult to resolve.</p> \n<h3><span>1) 20,000</span></h3> \n<p><!-- CHORUS_VIDEO_EMBED ChorusVideo:49687 --></p> \n<p> </p> \n<p><span>The CIA </span><a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/things-about-isis-you-need-to-know/iraqi-army-sectarian-lines"">estimates</a><span> that ISIS has a fighting strength of 20,000 — at minimum. The high-end estimate is 31,500.</span></p> \n<p>Back in June, the Agency estimated that ISIS <a href=""http://www.cnn.com/2014/09/11/world/meast/isis-syria-iraq/index.html"">topped out</a> at about 10,000 soldiers. But after its June 10 offensive that swept northern Iraq (explained in the above video), ISIS' recruiting surged. Moreover, the group captured advanced American equipment during the offensive, which has given it an edge even against the well-trained Kurdish peshmerga.</p> \n<p>These ISIS fighters are extremely effective in tactical terms. The veterans are battle-tested from years of fighting in Syria and Iraq, and ISIS has skilled ex-Saddam commanders in its officer corps. In June, <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/6/12/5803416/isis-one-sentence-iraqi-army"">800 ISIS fighters sent 30,000 Iraqi army troops packing</a> from Mosul, Iraq's second largest city.</p> \n<p>Contrast this with the Syrian rebels the US is trying to arm and train. <a href=""http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-24403003"">The BBC</a> <span>reported in December 2013 that there are about 1,000 rebel groups in Syria, totaling about 100,000 soldiers.

(Ahmed al-Rubaye/AFP/Getty Images)</p> \n<p>New Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi's cabinet is 56 percent Shia, according to <a href=""http://musingsoniraq.blogspot.com/2014/09/iraq-premier-abadis-cabinet-sworn-in.html"">a count</a> by indispensable Iraq blogger Joel Wing. That makes his cabinet even more Shia heavy than either of his disgraced predecessor Nuri al-Maliki's last two administrations, which were (respectively) 52 and 46 percent Shia.</p> \n<p>Why does this matter? Well, Sunni discontent with Iraq's largely Shia government is <a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/things-about-isis-you-need-to-know/sunni-shia-conflict-ISIS""><i>the</i> core driver of ISIS' strength</a> in heavily Sunni northwest Iraq. The Obama administration's Iraq strategy is premised on the idea that the current government will govern in a far less sectarian manner than Maliki, who was <a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/things-about-isis-you-need-to-know/maliki-sunni-shia-tension"">quite cruel to Sunnis</a>, did.</p> \n<p><q class=""right"" aria-hidden=""true"">""the new government is likely to be more hardline than Maliki""</q></p> \n<p>""I've insisted that additional US action depended upon Iraqis forming an inclusive government, which they have now done in recent days,"" Obama said in his September 10 address announcing the new counter-ISIS campaign.</p> \n<p>But the reality of the Iraqi government, thus far, suggests the opposite. ""The government is composed mostly of Shia Islamists who may not differ from Maliki on many key issues,"" Fanar Haddad, an expert on Iraq's Sunni-Shia divide at the National University of Singapore, told me in an email. ""In fact, the track record shows that the new government is likely to be more hardline than Maliki on contentious issues.""</p> \n<p>Haddad points to the new coalition's ""voting patterns and positions"" on two core Sunni-Shia issues as proof. First, they've been skeptical of decentralization, which means granting more autonomy to Sunni and Kurdish regions. Second, they've held up efforts to rewrite Iraq's de-Baathification law, which excludes former members of Saddam's government from holding positions in government. In practice, de-Baathification has been used to exclude Sunnis from important positions in the army and other major Iraqi institutions.</p> \n<p>Indeed, some of the hardline Shia parties in Abadi's coalition <a href=""http://www.hudson.org/research/10505-iraq-s-second-sunni-insurgency"">helped scuttle</a> an early 2013 proposal from Maliki and Sunni lawmaker Saleh al-Mutlaq to reform de-Baathification laws. Many of these guys, in other words, are significantly more hardline than Maliki.</p> \n<p>So while Abadi himself has promised to govern more inclusively, his coalition may make that extremely hard to do. And until that changes, Sunnis will continue to feel alienated — and will turn to ISIS.</p> \n<h3>3) 0</h3> \n<p><chorus-asset data-id=""675136"" class=""chorus-snippet browser_wide_media""> <img src=""http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/675136/Iraqi_insurgents_with_guns_2006.0.JPG"" class=""small"" alt=""al-Qaeda in Iraq fighters""> </chorus-asset></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Anti-American Iraqi insurgents in 2006. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraqi_insurgency_(2003%E2%80%9311)#mediaviewer/File:Iraqi_insurgents_with_guns.JPG"" style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5;"">Menendj</a></p> \n<p>According to <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/us-weakens-al-qaeda-groups-around-the-world-but-hasnt-wiped-any-out/2014/09/11/3c28d626-39bb-11e4-8601-97ba88884ffd_story.html?hpid=z1"">the Washington Post</a>, the US has failed to destroy a single major <span>Islamist terrorist organization since 9/11. That's right: after the so-called War on Terror began, the United States hasn't managed to annihilate a single significant militant group. And Obama wants to make ISIS, one of the strongest such groups we've ever seen, the very first.</span></p> \n<p>Obviously, America's failure isn't for lack of trying. It's because destroying terrorist organizations is quite difficult. These organizations, <a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/isis-myths-iraq/isis-islam"">ISIS included</a>, often have some level of support from the local population, which makes it easy for them to hide among civilians and recruit new fighters. They frequently have <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/5/21/5738190/drone-study-decapitation-fails"">bureaucratic, decentralized leadership</a> structures that make the loss of even high-level leaders insignificant. ISIS may be an exception here, as self-proclaimed Caliph Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi is quite important to the group, but it's tricky to make the case that ISIS will fall apart without Baghdadi so long as he's still alive.</p> \n<p>Moreover, ISIS has a history of resiliency. During the later stages of the Iraq war, a Sunni uprising (called the Awakening) and an improved US offensive demolished what was then al-Qaeda in Iraq, reducing its membership by about 95 percent. Yet despite these losses, <a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/things-about-isis-you-need-to-know/what-is-isis"">AQI rebuilt itself</a>, and eventually morphed into ISIS.</p> \n<p><q class=""right"" aria-hidden=""true"">""We're not going to see an end to this in our lifetime""</q></p> \n<p>Obama cited US campaigns against Islamist militants in Yemen and Somalia as success cases. But, as <a href=""http://thinkprogress.org/world/2014/09/10/3566167/the-most-discouraging-sentence-in-obamas-entire-isis-speech/"">ThinkProgress</a>' Hayes Brown pointed out, al-Qaeda in Yemen, called al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, has weathered the US bombing campaign. The National Counterterrorism Center believes that AQAP is the terrorist group ""most likely to attempt transnational attacks against the United States."" And al-Shabaab, the Somali militant group, is alive and kicking, though the US and local allies have killed some of its leaders and pushed it back from its territorial high-water mark.</p> \n<p>The point, then, is that everything we know about similar organizations suggests that the campaign against ISIS will take a long time, if it ever succeeds. ISIS can be weakened and pushed back, but destroying it outright is next-to-impossible.</p> \n<p>""We're not going to see an end to this in our lifetime,"" Charles F. Wald, a retired Air Force general who oversaw the start of the air war in Afghanistan in 2001, told the Post.</p> \n<p>It's not exactly a heartening thought.</p>",Politics

That's not surprising — in fact, it was possibly the most tone-deaf thing she could have said.</p> \n<p>Advocates are still recovering from the announcement of Obama's delay, which they saw as a crushing disappointment — and the latest in a long line of broken promises from Democratic officials. From <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/9/9/6126203/immigration-advocates-are-devastated-and-they-want-democrats-to-feel"" target=""_blank"">my article last week</a>:</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>Even several days after the announcement, the prevailing mood among immigration advocates was that they felt devastated, and betrayed. ""When your supposed friends break multiple promises, it feels really shitty. That's just a basic human reaction,"" says Frank Sharry, the executive director of immigration-advocacy group America's Voice. [...]</p> \n<p>Advocates are taking the delay so personally that they're struggling to focus on how to respond. ""It's obvious that all of us in the community, and working on the issue of immigration reform, need time to lick our wounds before moving forward,"" says Ben Monterroso, the director of voter-mobilization group Mi Familia Vota. Sharry adds that ""a lot of community groups are really pissed and haven't figured out what to do about it.""</p> \n</blockquote> \n<h3>Advocates feel they've tried ""electing more Democrats"" — for nothing</h3> \n<p><span>Immigration advocates point out that Democrats from President Obama on down have promised Latinos that putting a Democrat in the White House would result in relief for millions of immigrant families. So advocates feel they, and Latino voters, have spent the last several electoral cycles fighting to keep Democrats in office — working for Obama's election in 2008 and 2012, and helping save the Senate for the Democrats in 2010 — to make sure that promise comes true. </span><span>And in return, they feel, the President has </span><a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/9/7/6116367/obama-immigration-strategy-work-republicans-delay-elections"">broken promises</a><span> he's made to their community, from 2008 to today, and </span><a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/9/7/6116367/obama-immigration-strategy-work-republicans-delay-elections"">lectured them </a><span>hat the time isn't right for Democrats to take broad action against deportation.</span></p> \n<p><span>So the question facing immigration reformers right now isn't how to get the right people in office so that immigration reform will become possible. They feel they've done that already, and it apparently hasn't been enough. </span></p> \n<p><span>The DREAMers — like the ones who confronted Clinton over the weekend — feel that Democrats have squandered the trust of their community. Now, </span><a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/9/9/6126203/immigration-advocates-are-devastated-and-they-want-democrats-to-feel"" target=""_blank"">they believe it's their job</a><span> to force politicians to care about them and their families. As I wrote last week: </span></p> \n<blockquote> \n<p><span></span><span>Felipe Sousa-Rodriguez describes United We Dream as ""fiercely nonpartisan."" When asked about the administration's latest promise to announce executive action by the end of 2014, he responds, ""We don't trust them.""</span></p> \n<p>""Our position is that we will hold accountable people who stand in the way of progress. And sometimes those people are the president,"" he says.[...]</p> \n<p>""I think the DREAMers will do stuff that makes the Democrats extremely uncomfortable,"" says Sharry. ""That's just their way.""</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>The reason DREAMers were in Iowa last weekend to begin with was because they didn't feel that Hillary Clinton would take the needs of their community seriously if they weren't there to raise the question to her. They were there <i>because</i> they feel ""elect more Democrats"" is the wrong answer.</p> \n<p>To understand where the DREAMers are coming from, it's important to understand that they don't see ""hold politicians accountable"" and ""elect more Democrats"" as opposites. <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/9/9/6126203/immigration-advocates-are-devastated-and-they-want-democrats-to-feel"">My article from last week</a> explains the way that immigrant advocates understand their relationship with the Democratic Party, and why they feel that Democrats need to start taking them more seriously.</p>",Politics

""She has led her members — sometimes against internal resistance — to embrace innovations that were once unthinkable,"" the New York Times <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/16/education/16teacher.html?pagewanted=all"">wrote</a> in October 2010. ""She has acted out of a fear that teachers' unions could end up on the wrong side of a historic and inevitable wave of change.""</p> \n<p>But Lewis challenged the idea that teachers unions should work with reformers to find common ground.</p> \n<p>Under Lewis' leadership, Chicago teachers in fall 2012 overwhelmingly voted to strike — the first teachers' strike in 25 years. The strike lasted seven days and ended in a <a href=""http://www.suntimes.com/news/education/15224814-418/emanuel-deal-is-honest-compromise.html#.VBct1i5dX5k"" style=""line-height: 1.5; background-color: #ffffff;"">compromise</a> that could be framed as a win for both sides: it preserved seniority-based raises for teachers, but established an evaluation system that took students' growth, as measured by standardized tests, into account. After the strike ended, Lewis and Weingarten co-wrote a Wall Street Journal <a style=""line-height: 1.5; background-color: #ffffff;"" href=""http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10000872396390444032404578010731103676940"">op-ed</a> that lauded the compromise as ""solution-driven unionism.""</p> \n<p><span>Lewis' stand also energized unions in other cities, says Andy Rotherham, the founder of Bellwether Education Partners and a former Clinton education adviser.

""Karen Lewis was the one who put a stake in the ground and said, no, there's another option, which is to fight.""</p> \n<p><span>Lewis wasn't the only factor. The battles in Wisconsin over collective bargaining for public-sector unions also pushed teachers unions into a more militant position.

(Nate Silver elaborates on why <a href=""http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/senate-update-democrats-draw-almost-even-is-it-the-money/"">here</a>.) The <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/newsgraphics/2014/senate-model/#outcomes"">Upshot's forecast</a>has done the same, resulting in a 50-50 forecast. The <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dre/politics/election-lab-2014"">Washington Post's forecast</a>, which was so <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/7/23/5924151/will-republicans-win-senate-2014"">strongly favorable</a> to Republicans this summer, is also now 50-50.</p> \n<p>What's behind the change? All these models incorporate ""fundamental"" factors in their forecasts that tended to advantage the GOP — things like incumbency and presidential approval ratings —  but, as the election nears, they're relying more heavily on pure polling, and Democrats are doing surprisingly well in the polls.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, two of the models that most favored Democrats — <a href=""http://election.princeton.edu/"">Sam Wang's</a> and <a href=""http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/2014/senate-outlook"">HuffPostPollster's</a> — have moved slightly toward the GOP. (The <a style=""line-height: 1.5;"" href=""http://www.dailykos.com/poll-explorer/2014-senate"">Daily Kos model</a> has basically stayed the same.) Those models already relied on polls alone. So another part of what's happening is that the models are converging. As more polls come in and give everyone more data to work with, outlier projections are moderated.</p> \n<p>These changes shouldn't be overstated — in a probabilistic forecast, 60-40 looks a lot like an ordinary coin flip, as the Upshot's <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/09/02/kentucky-survey_n_5751506.html"">Amanda Cox</a> explained recently. But with this year's battle for the Senate looking so close, small differences like these could end up determining which party has control for Obama's last two years. Here's how things are looking now.</p> \n<h3>1) Democrats are favored in the purple states</h3> \n<p><chorus-asset data-id=""789390"" class=""chorus-snippet browser_wide_media""> <img src=""http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/789390/452182096.0.jpg"" class=""small"" alt=""Kay Hagan""> </chorus-asset></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Senator Kay Hagan (D-NC). (Bill Clark - CQ-Roll Call Group/Getty)</p> \n<p>In early September, I <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/9/6/6106047/who-will-win-the-senate-nate-silver-sam-wang-2014"">outlined</a> how some models showed North Carolina's Senate race as a toss-up, but others gave a clear edge to Democrat Kay Hagan. The summer polls had shown ""a small margin but an extremely consistent margin"" in Hagan's favor, and the Post's model accordingly gave her a very high chance of winning, its co-creator Eric McGhee told me. Other models were more skeptical of her chances — either because they treated that small margin with more uncertainty, or because they were more skeptical of the polls themselves. Seven of the 10 recent polls had come from avowedly partisan pollsters, some polled registered voters rather than likely voters, and some came from firms with poor track records in past elections.</p> \n<p>Since then, eight <a href=""http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/2014-north-carolina-senate-tillis-vs-hagan"">new polls</a> of the race have been released — six showing Hagan ahead, one showing a tie, and just one showing her challenger Thom Tillis with a narrow lead. This seems to have cleared things up: Hagan is ahead. The more uncertain models' forecasts have moved accordingly:</p> \n<div align=""center""> \n<p><chorus-asset class=""chorus-snippet browser_wide_media"" data-id=""903496""><img alt=""NC-SEN_9-16.0.0.png"" class=""small"" src=""http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/903496/NC-SEN_9-16.0.0.png""></chorus-asset></p> \n</div> \n<p>This is part of a larger trend that's been occurring in polls from presidential swing states (""purple states""). Since my early September post, all four <a href=""http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/2014-colorado-senate-gardner-vs-udall"">new polls</a> of the Colorado Senate race have showed Democrat Mark Udall ahead. And in Iowa, where the race between Bruce Braley and Joni Ernst looked very tight in the late summer, the three <a href=""http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/2014-iowa-senate-ernst-vs-braley"">newest polls</a> released show Braley ahead. (Update: Wednesday morning, though, a new poll <a href=""http://www.quinnipiac.edu/news-and-events/quinnipiac-university-poll/iowa/release-detail?releaseid=2079"">showed</a> a sizable lead for Ernst.) Meanwhile, Republicans hoped to put Democratic-held seats in Michigan and New Hampshire in play, but haven't yet had much success in the polls (though the New Hampshire race has <a href=""http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/2014-new-hampshire-senate-brown-vs-shaheen"">tightened</a> a bit).</p> \n<p>It's still far from assured that Democrats will manage to sweep all these purple state races. In Iowa particularly, the Democratic advantage in most models is a small one. But if they do manage to do so, Democrats will have 49 seats — and, with Vice President Joe Biden prepared to cast tie-breaking votes, they'd need just one win in a red state to keep their majority.</p> \n<h3>2) The red states look good for Republicans, though polls have been sparse in some</h3> \n<p><chorus-asset data-id=""789360"" class=""chorus-snippet browser_wide_media""> <img src=""http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/789360/452531786.0.jpg"" class=""small"" alt=""Mary Landrieu""> </chorus-asset></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Senator Mary Landrieu (D-LA). (Tom Williams - CQ-Roll Call Group/Getty)</p> \n<p>Is a red-state sweep possible for the GOP? First, they'd have to hold on to their own seats in Kentucky and Georgia — which looks very likely. Despite the media-friendly nature of the Kentucky race, polling has <a href=""http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/2014-kentucky-senate-mcconnell-vs-grimes"">clearly shown</a> Mitch McConnell ahead and election forecasters view him as the overwhelming favorite. In Georgia, Democrat Michelle Nunn <a href=""http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/2014-georgia-senate-perdue-vs-nunn"">also trails</a>, and unless she can manage to win over 50 percent of the vote in November, she'll face the added difficult challenge of winning a runoff election in January.</p> \n<p>Second, the GOP would have to knock off Democratic incumbents Mark Pryor (AR) and Mary Landrieu (LA). Beating incumbents is rarely easy, but these two Democrats have had little good news in the polls lately. Most recent polls shown Pryor <a href=""http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/2014-arkansas-senate-cotton-vs-pryor"">trailing</a> Rep. Tom Cotton, and as a result, he's <a href=""https://twitter.com/Nate_Cohn/status/510787737403002880"">moved</a> from a favorite to an underdog in Sam Wang's snapshots. Polling has been rarer in Louisiana, but Landrieu also has to win a runoff if she gets less than 50 percent of the vote, as looks likely. And she's led very few of the <a href=""http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/2014-louisiana-senate-cassidy-vs-landrieu"">head-to-head polls</a> against Rep. Bill Cassidy conducted this year. So Republican odds look good in both of these.</p> \n<p>Then there's the Alaska race between Democrat Mark Begich and Republican Dan Sullivan. Here, the polling has been extremely sparse — but the only two nonpartisan polls to have come out recently <a href=""http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/2014-alaska-senate-sullivan-vs-begich"">have shown</a> Democrat Mark Begich behind. (They've moved him from an overwhelming favorite in Sam Wang's <a href=""http://election.princeton.edu/2014/08/28/senate-democrats-are-outperforming-expectations/"">late August snapshot</a> to an underdog.) Additionally, Nate Silver <a href=""http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/senate-update-alaska-a-frontier-for-bad-polling/"">wrote recently</a> that Alaska polls have overestimated how well Democrats would perform in every single competitive race there since 2000.</p> \n<h3>3) Forecasters are still trying to figure out what to make of Kansas</h3> \n<p><chorus-asset data-id=""789330"" class=""chorus-snippet browser_wide_media""> <img src=""http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/789330/483778691.0.jpg"" class=""small"" alt=""Pat Roberts""> </chorus-asset></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Senator Pat Roberts (R-KS). (Tom Williams - CQ-Roll Call Group/Getty)</p> \n<p>If the GOP manages to defeat the three red-state Democratic incumbents while losing all the purple state races, control of the Senate will hinge on the strange election in Kansas, where Sen. Pat Roberts (R) is pitted against independent Greg Orman. (Democrat Chad Taylor <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/9/4/6103485/kansas-senate-pat-roberts-chad-taylor-greg-orman"">dropped out</a> of the race, and <a href=""http://talkingpointsmemo.com/dc/kansas-senate-supreme-court-hearing"">is trying</a> to get his name taken off the ballot.)</p> \n<p>Before this week, only two polls had attempted to measure what the race might look like without Taylor. First, before Taylor even dropped out, a poll pitting Orman against Roberts showed Orman up 10. Second, a poll after the news gave Orman a one-point lead — but the respondents were told that Taylor had dropped out, even though they wouldn't be told that in the voting booth.</p> \n<p>The bizarre turn of events has proved a challenge for the forecasters, and most have responded with caution. By Monday of this week, most models still gave the advantage to Roberts or viewed the race as a toss-up. But one had a very different view:</p> \n<p align=""center""> </p> \n<div align=""center""> \n<p><chorus-asset data-id=""854320"" class=""chorus-snippet browser_wide_media""> <img src=""http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/854320/KS-SEN_9-16.0.png"" class=""small"" alt=""KS-SEN 9-15""> </chorus-asset></p> \n</div> \n<p><a href=""http://election.princeton.edu/"">Sam Wang</a> emphasizes that his race-to-race numbers are ""snapshots"" of current conditions rather than projections for November, which sets his numbers apart from other modelers. But Wang's results for individual races matter — because while his model has gotten a lot of attention lately for being the most favorable to Democrats, much of that advantage now <a href=""http://election.princeton.edu/todays-senate-seat-count-histogram/"">hinges</a> on his strong estimate that Orman is ahead. And, on Monday, he was basing that estimate on just two polls showing an Orman lead.</p> \n<p>""My general philosophical stance is that polls are more informative about voter opinion than any other parameter,"" Wang told me recently. Essentially, he believes that the best measure of the state of a Kansas Senate race is a poll that tries to measure the race. He argues that anything else — whether it's fundamentals or added state-based measures of uncertainty — is ""<a href=""http://election.princeton.edu/2014/09/09/is-nate-silver-a-little-too-excited-about-probabilities/"">special sauce</a>"" that dilutes a direct measure of public opinion.</p> \n<p>The other modelers had many plausible reasons for discounting those two Kansas polls. Voters might not know much about Orman yet, and he hasn't yet been exposed to many negative attacks. Taylor's name, if left on the ballot, could draw precious votes away from the independent. Many undecided voters remained. And Kansas is so conservative that it's difficult to imagine a Republican incumbent losing his Senate seat.</p> \n<p>But on Tuesday morning, a <a href=""http://www.politico.com/story/2014/09/poll-greg-orman-pat-roberts-111001.html"">new poll</a> was released showing Orman up seven. Two polls became three, and most of the models moved in Orman's direction. We'll keep an eye on what happens next.</p> \n<div align=""center""> \n<p><a href=""http://www.vox.com/a/election-2014-forecast""><chorus-asset data-id=""815890"" class=""chorus-snippet browser_wide_media""> <img src=""http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/815890/BattleforCongress-inArticle-Door.0.png"" class=""small"" alt=""Battle for Congress""></chorus-asset></a></p> \n</div>",Politics
"The conservative war over Ted Cruz, Middle Eastern Christians, and Israel",http://www.vox.com/2014/9/16/6154189/defense-of-christians-ted-cruz,Helping Middle Eastern Christians avoid genocide sounds like an incredibly uncontroversial subject for a conference. Here's how Ted Cruz and pro-Israel conservative writers turned it into one.,"<p>A summit dedicated to the proposition that Middle Eastern Christians should be defended from genocidal violence inflicted by ISIS and other jihad groups doesn't <i>sound</i> like a very controversial undertaking in American conservative politics. But the <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/indefenseofchristians"">In Defense of Christians</a> summit last week became the grounds for conflict, as Sen. Ted Cruz delivered a speech that got him booed off the stage by some members of the audience. The event then set conservative pundits at war with each other, with some condemning Cruz and others praising him. The contretemps provides an interesting window into both the complexity and contradictions of Middle Eastern politics, and also the conservative movement's mixed feelings about Cruz's star status.</p> \n<p>But both the controversy itself and the geopolitical issues underlying it are rather tangled. Here's a guide for the perplexed.</p> \n<h3>Why did In Defense of Christians become controversial?</h3> \n<p><chorus-asset data-id=""767626"" class=""chorus-snippet browser_wide_media""> <img src=""http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/767626/Screen_Shot_2014-09-16_at_9.38.42_AM.0.png"" class=""small"" alt=""Screen_Shot_2014-09-16_at_9.38.42_AM.0.png""> </chorus-asset></p> \n<p class=""caption"">The summiteers (<a href=""http://www.indefenseofchristians.org/"">In Defense of Christians</a>)</p> \n<p>The controversy actually began a bit before the conference started, when Alana Goodman of the Washington Free Beacon published a piece headlined ""<a href=""http://freebeacon.com/national-security/cruz-headlines-conference-featuring-hezbollah-supporters/"">Cruz Headlines Conference Featuring Hezbollah Supporters</a>.""</p> \n<p>Specifically, Goodman wrote that ""the roster of speakers includes some of the Assad regime's most vocal Christian supporters, as well as religious leaders allied with the Iranian-backed terrorist group Hezbollah."" She cited several examples of pro-Assad statements and activities by some of the Syrian Christians in attendance, as well anti-Israel statements by some Lebanese Christian attendees who are aligned with Hezbollah in Lebanese politics. Goodman's article called out several politicians for their involvement in the conference and noted that it was ""funded by a controversial Clinton donor,"" but she very much highlighted Cruz's role. Cruz and his staff, meanwhile, <a href=""http://www.buzzfeed.com/rosiegray/ted-cruz-had-advance-warning-of-hezbollah-ties-at-christian?utm_term=4844fpi#12cjdr6"">were apparently aware of the links to Hezbollah</a> even before the Free Beacon article ran.</p> \n<h3>What did Ted Cruz do?</h3> \n<p>Faced with a potential political problem, Cruz staged what Slate's David Weigel <a href=""http://www.slate.com/blogs/weigel/2014/09/11/watch_ted_cruz_turn_a_political_problem_into_a_pro_israel_sister_souljah.html"">characterized</a> as a Sister Souljah moment. Instead of backing out of the conference, Cruz stepped up to the plate and delivered a speech that veered off the topic of the plight of Middle Eastern Christians into a strident defense of Israel:</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>Those who hate Israel hate America. Those who hate Jews hate Christians. If those in this room will not recognize that, then my heart weeps. If you hate the Jewish people you are not reflecting the teachings of Christ. And the very same people who persecute and murder Christians right now, who crucify Christians, who behead children, are the very same people who target Jews for their faith, for the same reason.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>At this point, Cruz got booed — either because audience members disagreed with the substance of his remarks or because they disliked his hijacking of the event to talk about Israel. Cruz responded by saying that he cannot ""stand with"" Middle Eastern Christians who refuse to stand with Israel.</p> \n<p><iframe frameborder=""0"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/nB_mX4t5qpM"" height=""315"" width=""560""></iframe></p> \n<h3>Why are some Middle Eastern Christians supporting Assad and Hezbollah?</h3> \n<p>The political movement against Bashar al-Assad's government rather quickly began to take on somewhat sectarian overtones. The fundamental dynamic is that Assad and many of his key supporters are members of the small Alawite sect, while most Syrians are Sunni Muslims. Many members of Syria's Christian minority feel they're better-off living under an undemocratic regime run by a religious minority than they would be living under an empowered Sunni majority. That's especially because many Syrian opposition groups — not just ISIS, but also al-Qaeda's Syrian franchise, Jabhat al-Nusra, and many of the more moderate rebel groups the United States works with — have an explicitly Sunni religious agenda. Assad's key regional allies are Iran and Lebanon's Hezbollah, both of which are dire enemies of Israel. Consequently, the civil wars in Syria and Iraq have tended to place those countries' Christian populations in objective alignment with Hezbollah.</p> \n<p>The Lebanese political situation is very complicated. But currently, the highly diverse country is polarized between a Sunni-led faction supported by the Persian Gulf states and a Shia-led faction that includes Hezbollah and is aligned with Assad. Lebanese Christian groups are found on both sides of the divide and currently the group affiliated with <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michel_Aoun"">General Michael Aoun</a> is aligned with Syria and Hezbollah. Lebanese perceptions of Israel are also deeply influenced by Israel's ill-fated involvement in Lebanon's civil war in the 1980s.</p> \n<p>There is also a substantial Christian population in Israel and the Palestinian territories, most of which identifies with secular versions of Palestinian nationalism and is critical of Israel and the Israeli occupation. In recent years, the growing influence of Islamist movements in Palestinian politics has had a deleterious effect on Palestinian Christians and there is now a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sons_of_the_New_Testament"">small pro-Israel movement</a> among Christian Arabs with Israeli citizenship.</p> \n<h3>Who is attacking Cruz?</h3> \n<div class=""align-left""> \n<p><chorus-asset data-id=""767772"" class=""chorus-snippet browser_wide_media""> <img src=""http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/767772/douthat-profile.0.jpg"" class=""small"" alt=""douthat-profile.0.jpg""> </chorus-asset></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Ross Douthat (<a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/10/opinion/10douthat.html"">Susan Etheridge/NYT</a>)</p> \n</div> \n<p>Cruz's remarks attracted the ire of a number of conservative (mostly Catholic) writers. His most prominent critic in the American media is probably New York Times columnist Ross Douthat, who wrote that Cruz's ""logic shows not a scintilla of sympathy for what it's actually like to be an embattled religious minority, against whom genocide isn't just being threatened but actually carried out."" Douthat says that Cruz ""could have withdrawn from the event"" if his conscience truly forbid him from addressing the assembly, and ""the fact that he preferred to do it this way instead says a lot — none of it good — about his priorities and instincts.""</p> \n<p>Pascal Emmanuel Gobry <a href=""http://theweek.com/article/index/267993/ted-cruz-and-the-most-cynical-despicable-political-stunt-of-the-year"">wrote</a> in the Week that ""Cruz tarred and attacked one of the most powerless and beleaguered minorities in the world, solely for personal political gain."" His colleague Michael Brendan Dougherty went <a href=""http://theweek.com/article/index/268031/the-demagoguery-of-ted-cruz-and-his-cheerleaders-in-the-conservative-media"">somewhat further</a>, not only scolding Cruz for his bad manners but acknowledging that Arab Christian dislike of Israel has some rational basis. ""Last year Israel <a href=""http://vaticaninsider.lastampa.it/en/world-news/detail/articolo/israele-israel-israel-29365/"">bulldozed the home</a> of the Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem, Fouad Twal,"" he wrote, while ""Palestinian Christians in the occupied territories don't have free access to Christian holy sites.""</p> \n<p>Mollie Hemingway at the Federalist argued that <a href=""http://thefederalist.com/2014/09/11/ted-cruz-is-no-hero-for-insulting-a-room-of-persecuted-christians/"">Cruz had overlooked the case</a> for Christian solidarity even in the face of geopolitical disagreements. ""Hopefully we can all recognize the importance of dealing with this huge problem of Christians being killed and oppressed,"" she wrote ""even if our politics aren't all the same, right?

Obama's biggest economic policy mistake,http://www.vox.com/2014/9/17/6219247/obamas-biggest-economic-policy-mistake,Politicians neglect the Fed at their own peril â€” and that of the country as well.,"<p>Barack Obama has not accomplished nearly as much as his most fervent supporters — or, indeed, the president himself — had hoped he would during the 2008 campaign. This has led, naturally, to a litany of back-biting complaints about the corruption or incompetence of the president and his team, a storied list of alleged tactical failings or ideological betrayals. The truth is, however, that he has accomplished an enormous amount given the <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/8/6/5974807/the-deep-irony-of-barack-obamas-presidency-in-one-sentence"">objective structural circumstances of American politics</a>.</p> \n<p>But as the country waits to hear the latest announcement from the Fed about how rapidly it will end its Quantitative Easing programs, we are witnessing the biggest mistake of Obama's presidency: the systematic neglect of the Federal Reserve and of his ability to influence its course of action.</p> \n<p>This is a failure that sounds boring but has likely doomed millions of people to needlessly long spells of unemployment; permanently reduced the structural capacity of the American economy; and, through poor macroeconomic performance, reduced his political ability to drive change in environmental policy, bank regulation, and other areas.</p> \n<h3>The team player</h3> \n<p><chorus-asset class=""chorus-snippet browser_wide_media"" data-id=""817910""> <img alt=""451606910.0.0.jpg"" class=""small"" src=""http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/817910/451606910.0.0.jpg""> </chorus-asset></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Let's get along (Alex Wong/Getty)</p> \n<p>The Federal Reserve's September 17 statement isn't likely to offer any surprises to anyone who'd been watching Fed statements from earlier in the year. The Fed is set to continue its course of <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/6/17/5795000/reasons-the-fed-should-reconsider-taper"">unwisely tightening monetary policy</a> even as unemployment remains high and inflation remains low. The only question being debated at today's Fed meeting is <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/9/17/6250725/the-four-most-important-words-in-the-economy-right-now"">how quickly to tighten</a>. Earlier in the year, proponents of more monetary stimulus had reason to hope that we might get something different from new Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen. During her previous service on the Fed, she had amassed a reputation as one of the governors most concerned with weakness in the labor market and most eager to push for more aggressive stimulus. Her elevation to the top job should have increased her clout and increased the odds of more easing.</p> \n<p>Instead, as Jon Hilsenrath — far and away the best-sourced reporter on the Fed beat — explained earlier this week, with the new job <a href=""http://online.wsj.com/articles/fed-chief-yellen-seeks-interest-rate-consensus-1410748205"">came a shift in Yellen's role</a>. The Chair does not actually have much in the way of formal powers that elevate her above the other members of the Open Market Commission. So as Chair, Yellen ""has taken a much different approach, becoming a restrained consensus seeker modeled after her predecessor"" rather than her previous role as an ""unabashed advocate of easy money who pressed colleagues to embrace her view.""</p> \n<p>Given the structure of the Federal Reserve, this is perhaps an inevitable choice on her part. But what's not inevitable is the set of people between whom the consensus needs to be forged. The FOMC that makes these decisions is mostly composed of presidential appointees — the seven members of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors. But Obama has failed to make a point of tapping proponents of monetary stimulus for these positions. Even worse, he's left two of the slots entirely vacant — not vacant because of GOP obstruction, but vacant because he hasn't nominated anyone to fill them.</p> \n<h3>Obama's monetary theory</h3> \n<p><chorus-asset class=""chorus-snippet browser_wide_media"" data-id=""818318""> <img alt=""romer_summers.0.jpg"" class=""small"" src=""http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/818318/romer_summers.0.jpg""> </chorus-asset></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Romer and Summers (<a href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/whitehouse/4608975798/in/photolist-87WEUC-7JBUxJ-82hcVY-6iSwPM"">White House photo</a>)</p> \n<p><span>Obama's neglect of Federal Reserve appointments is, in some ways, mysterious. Nobody denies that the Fed is an extremely important institution — albeit one that operates independently from the elected branches of government. When it comes to other important independent institutions such as the federal judiciary, it's broadly acknowledged that the presidential appointment powers are among his </span><i style=""font-family: 'Alright Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5;"">most important</i><span> powers of office. Precisely because judges operated independently of presidential oversight, picking the right ones is vital.</span></p> \n<p><span>The Fed is similar. Except that because the Fed has an important influence on short-term economic growth and short-term economic growth has an important influence on the president's popularity, it's even more important.</span></p> \n<p>Except Obama doesn't seem to see it that way. Earlier in his administration he reportedly told Council of Economic Advisors Chair Christina Romer that ""monetary policy has shot its wad."" This remark was <a href=""http://www.slate.com/blogs/weigel/2011/09/22/suskindblogging_the_sexism_story.html"">dissected</a> for alleged sexism, but is more worth paying attention to as a reflection of monetary policy views.</p> \n<p>The viewpoint that there is nothing the Federal Reserve can do to boost the economy when short-term interest rates are <a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/fed_vs_crisis/why-cant-interest-rates-go-below-zero"">already at zero</a>, leaving deficit spending as the only effective stimulus option, is not believed by most experts. This particular combination of views is most closely associated with a somewhat marginal group of left-wing thinkers who describe themselves as <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/modern-monetary-theory-is-an-unconventional-take-on-economic-strategy/2012/02/15/gIQAR8uPMR_story.html"">modern monetary theorists</a>. Except it's also something that key Obama advisor Larry Summers believes, and the fact that Obama tried to install Summers as Fed Chair indicates that Obama believes it too.</p> \n<p>This belief in monetary impotence likely explains why Obama is so lackadaisical about filling vacancies. He believes the Fed's role in fighting a potential crisis is crucial, but the current team helmed by Yellen and Deputy Chair Stanley Fisher is up to that job. Bolstering the left flank on the FOMC so that Yellen's consensus-building efforts would land in a more stimulative spot isn't on the agenda.</p> \n<h3>A long record of neglect</h3> \n<p><chorus-asset class=""chorus-snippet browser_wide_media"" data-id=""818516""> <img alt=""fed.0.png"" class=""small"" src=""http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/818516/fed.0.png""> </chorus-asset></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Missing persons (<a href=""http://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/default.htm"">Federal Reserve</a> &amp; Vox)</p> \n<p>The current vacancies are not a new phenomenon. By April of 2010 when Obama had been in office for well over a year <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/04/16/AR2010041602025.html"">there were three vacancies on the Fed</a>. One of his earlier nominees was a Republican and another — Jeremy Stein — is a Democrat who holds to an eccentric view that tight money is sometimes appropriate even when unemployment is high. That's the same opinion that led to <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/9/14/6147615/swedens-election-social-democrats-central-bank"">economic stagnation in Sweden</a>, and electoral defeat for its incumbent government.</p> \n<p>How much good could have been done if Obama had listened to Romer, <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/7/8/5866695/why-printing-more-money-could-have-stopped-the-great-recession"">Scott Sumner</a>, <a href=""http://www.rooseveltinstitute.org/new-roosevelt/what-constrains-federal-reserve-interview-joseph-gagnon"">Joseph Gagnon</a>, or others and placed a higher priority on appointing unemployment-fighters to the Fed? Nobody can say for sure. But the experience of the United Kingdom is illustrative. The UK government has enacted much sharper levels of fiscal austerity than anything done in the US, perhaps partly as a result the UK's overall economic performance has been dismal. And yet largely thanks to <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/7/28/5942569/britain-is-having-the-strangest-economic-recovery-in-the-world"">more stimulative monetary policy</a>, the UK has done as well or better than the United States in terms of job creation. If we had paired that kind of monetary policy with our superior fiscal policy and better luck at fossil fuel extraction, we could potentially have enjoyed significantly faster employment growth.</p> \n<p>That would have meant faster GDP growth, fewer workers exiting the labor force, and therefore higher estimates of the country's long-term economic potential. A speedier turnaround would also have meant a more popular administration, whose party would have done better in the 2010 and 2012 midterms and thus had more latitude to pursue its legislative preferences. FDR's long-term impact on American policy comes from the structural reforms of the New Deal. But as Romer showed in her <a href=""http://eml.berkeley.edu/~cromer/What%20Ended%20the%20Great%20Depression.pdf"">famous research on the Depression</a>, ""nearly all the observed recovery of the US economy prior to 1942 was due to monetary expansion."" That recovery — driven by Roosevelt's pursuit of aggressive monetary policy in the form of ditching the gold standard — is what gave him the political clout to pursue those structural reforms.</p> \n<p>Had Obama been as attuned to monetary matters as FDR, he could have secured a better result for the country and a firmer legacy for himself.</p>",Politics

Area pundit angry at political science for proving him wrong,http://www.vox.com/2014/9/17/6291859/area-pundit-angry-at-political-science-for-proving-him-wrong,What's the matter with Thomas Frank?,"<p>Salon columnist Thomas Frank does not like political science, and he particularly dislikes my <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/9/2/6088485/how-political-science-conquered-washington"">column</a> arguing that political science is improving political journalism. In riposte, he's written an <a href=""http://www.salon.com/2014/09/14/all_these_effing_geniuses_ezra_klein_expert_driven_journalism_and_the_phony_washington_consensus/"">article</a> demonstrating the need for political journalists to ground their ideas in political science.</p> \n<p>It's best to begin with where Frank and I agree. ""The powerful in Powertown love to take refuge in bewildering professional jargon,"" he writes, and indeed they do. ""They routinely ignore or suppress challenging ideas, just as academics often ignore ideas that come from outside their professional in-group,"" he says, and he's absolutely correct. ""Worst of all, Washingtonians seem to know nothing about the lives of people who aren't part of the professional-managerial class,"" he continues, and I fully agree (as do <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/9/3/6098677/the-class-war-in-american-politics-is-over-the-rich-won"">political scientists</a>).</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""center""><span>Washington is a cesspool of faux-experts who do bad research — or no research</span></q></p> \n<p>The question, then, is whether political science (and other academic disciplines) helps curb these tendencies, or whether it makes Powertown more jargony, close-minded, and out-of-touch.</p> \n<p>Frank thinks the latter. ""The characteristic failing of D.C. isn't that it ignores these herds of experts, it's that it attends to them with a gaping credulity that they do not deserve,"" he writes. Later, he blames the return of the same foreign-policy class that brought us the Iraq War on ""the way Washington worships expertise."" He even throws in a reference to David Halberstam's <i>The Best and the Brightest</i> for good measure.</p> \n<p>As it happens, Frank and I have some common ground here, too: Washington is a cesspool of <i>faux</i>-experts who do bad research (or no research) but retain their standing by dint of affiliations, connections, or charisma. Washington is also a place where people seek authorities willing to confirm what they already believe —  a trait it shares with, well, every other place. But I see political science research  —  which is different, by the way, from individual political scientists, and different from Frank's amorphous idea of ""expertise""  —  as a way of cutting through the bullshit.</p> \n<h3>The real problem with political science</h3> \n<p><chorus-asset class=""chorus-snippet browser_wide_media"" data-id=""909538""> <img alt=""Bill Clinton pointing"" class=""small"" src=""http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/909538/155461877.0.jpg""> </chorus-asset></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Your fault. (Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)</p> \n<p>Take Frank as an example. He's a gifted writer and a smart guy. But his biggest problem with political science seems to be that it stubbornly refuses to confirm his opinions. The example he gives in his article of bad political science is Nate Cohn (who is not a political scientist, for the record) <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/07/upshot/why-democrats-cant-win.html?_r=0&amp;abt=0002&amp;abg=1"">arguing</a> that the Democrats' disadvantage in the House comes less from gerrymandering than urban clustering. This is a debatable point (see Dave Weigel for <a href=""http://www.slate.com/blogs/weigel/2014/09/08/gerrymandering_and_the_big_sort_fallacy.html"">a contrary take</a>), but Frank actually doesn't debate it. He simply dislikes the implications Cohn draws from it:</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>[T]hese House Republicans are really, truly awful. Isn't there a way for Democrats to beat them regardless of the geographic hurdles? According to Cohn, not really. Either Democrats have to appeal to lost voters (like ""the conservative Democrats of the South and Appalachia"") by moving rightward, or they will have to ""wait for demographic and generational change"" to win the seats for them. And maybe that makes sense, given the assumptions of the lame school of political science that D.C. types always gravitate to - the kind in which there are but two poles in political life and politicians of the left party can only win if they move rightward.</p> \n<p>It is this kind of strikingly unoriginal thinking, which I am sure is shared by the blue team's high command, that explains why the Democratic Party looks to be headed for another disaster this fall.</p> \n<p>Allow me to drop a single, disturbing data point on this march of science. You might recall that Democrats controlled the House of Representatives from the early 1930s until 1994 with only two brief Republican interludes. What ended all that was not an ill-advised swerve to the left, but the opposite: A long succession of moves toward what is called the ""center,"" culminating in the administration of New Democrat Bill Clinton, who (among other things) signed the Republicans' NAFTA treaty into law. Taking economic matters off the table was thought to be the path of wisdom among expert-worshipping Washingtonians, but it had the unforeseen consequence of making culture that much more important for a large part of the population. Democrats were eventually swamped by all the crazy grievance campaigns of the right, which has splashed back and forth in the mud of the culture wars ever since.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>So Frank is angry at political science because someone who isn't a political scientist has offered a political opinion he disagrees with.</p> \n<p>Like much of what passes for political analysis in Washington, this is a convincing rant if you already agree with Thomas Frank. Frank, after all, is an ""expert"": he's a guy who writes bestselling books and has a column at Salon. He's charismatic, and his piece is well-written, and it includes a few lines that look like evidence if you back up ten paces and squint.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""center""><span>this is a convincing rant if you already agree with Thomas Frank</span></q></p> \n<p>But none of it holds up. For one thing, political science doesn't say what Frank seems to think it says. Political scientists don't simply argue that politicians have to move leftward or rightward to capture some mythical center. Indeed, one of the interesting findings from John Sides and Lynn Vavreck's <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/10/14/what-really-decided-the-2012-election-in-10-graphs/"">poli-sci take</a> on the 2012 election is that voters thought themselves closer ideologically to Mitt Romney  —  but they voted for Barack Obama anyway.</p> \n<p><chorus-asset class=""chorus-snippet browser_wide_media"" data-id=""905536""> <img alt=""romney obamas ideology"" class=""small"" src=""http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/905536/GAMBLEGRAPH_10__1_.0.png""> </chorus-asset></p> \n<p class=""caption"">(<a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/10/14/what-really-decided-the-2012-election-in-10-graphs/"">John Sides and Lynn Vavreck/Wonkblog</a>)</p> \n<p>That's consistent with what the best research in political science right now, which holds that most voters don't pay close attention to candidates' policy positions, so politicians actually have to tune their platforms to appeal to <a href=""http://www.gvpt.umd.edu/karol/Karol_Theory_of_Parties.pdf"">the intense policy demanders who dominate primaries</a>. Oh, and those ""moderate voters"" aren't moderates at all; their political opinions are <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/7/8/5878293/lets-stop-using-the-word-moderate"">often more extreme</a>, but more scattered, than the hardcore partisans.</p> \n<p>As for Frank's ""data point,"" this is exactly where political science research is useful. It <i>is</i> interesting that Democrats controlled the House of Representatives almost without interruption from 1935 to 1994. It's particularly interesting because, though Frank doesn't mention this, Republicans controlled the White House from 1953 to 1961. And then from 1969 to 1976. And then from 1981 to 1992. So it's clear that Democratic control of the House doesn't simply show a monolithically liberal electorate betrayed by Bill Clinton. But what does it show?</p> \n<h3>What political science research is good for</h3> \n<p><chorus-asset class=""chorus-snippet browser_wide_media"" data-id=""910488""> <img alt=""Strom Thurmond"" class=""small"" src=""http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/910488/3231974.0.jpg""> </chorus-asset></p> \n<p class=""caption"">The late Strom Thurmond used to be a Democrat — as well as one of the Senate's most conservative members.

The Democratic House majority that dominated through much of the 20th Century wasn't the Democratic Party as we think of it at all.</p> \n<p>Instead, it combined liberal and moderate Democrats with a conservative southern bloc that was, for reasons of congressional seniority and tribal history, Democratic, but which voted to the right of many Republicans. The peculiar rules of Congress made it worthwhile for Southern Democrats to stick with a party they disagreed with in order to protect Jim Crow.</p> \n<p>But once the Democratic Party broke with its southern bloc on race, the Southern Democrats died out. You can watch those conservative Democrats disappear on this visualization produced by the <a href=""http://voteview.com/blog/?p=1045"">DW-NOMINATE measure</a>, which political scientists use to measure party polarization in Congress. Notice how, in the period Frank mentions, you have lots of Ds further to the right than the Rs. Republicans retake the House as that anomaly ends.</p> \n<p><iframe frameborder=""0"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/_0TE5TWYP-I"" height=""480"" width=""640""></iframe></p> \n<p>Watching congressional Democrats who were more conservative than Republicans become Republicans is not a story that tracks very well with Frank's story of a populist electorate being turned off by Clinton's triangulations. Indeed, Clinton was <i>much</i> more liberal than many of the congressional Democrats who lost their seats in 1994. But Frank wants to see the Democratic Party move leftward, and so this isn't an analysis of the period that he finds very helpful.</p> \n<p>The reason I rely on political science research is because politics, in my experience, is thick with the ""allow me to drop a single, disturbing data point"" approach to analysis. <span>Skilled writers can make anything sound convincing in 24 column inches — particularly when they're writing to an audience that wants to be convinced.</span><span> Political science has its problems, but the discipline is more than capable of weeding out this kind of nonsense.

Nate Silver: Sam Wang's model showing Democratic Senate advantage 'is wrong',http://www.vox.com/2014/9/17/6333277/nate-silver-sam-wangs-model-showing-democratic-senate-advantage-is,He says the data doesn't check out.,"<p><span>Today, Nate Silver of FiveThirtyEight posted a </span><a href=""http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-the-fivethirtyeight-senate-forecast-model-works/#ss-4"">long explanation</a><span> of how his Senate forecasting model works this year — check out Vox's new </span><a href=""http://www.vox.com/a/election-2014-forecast"">forecasting hub</a><span> to see how it compares to several other models. But in today's post, Silver mentions that he has particular objections to the design of one competing model. That's Princeton neuroscientist Sam Wang's </span><a href=""http://election.princeton.edu/"">model</a><span>, which in recent weeks has given Democrats more </span><a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/9/6/6106047/who-will-win-the-senate-nate-silver-sam-wang-2014"">rosy projections</a><span> than any others, showing them with a clear Senate advantage. Silver writes:</span></p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>That model is wrong - not necessarily because it shows Democrats ahead (ours barely shows any Republican advantage), but because it substantially underestimates the uncertainty associated with polling averages and thereby overestimates the win probabilities for candidates with small leads in the polls. This is because instead of estimating the uncertainty empirically - that is, by looking at how accurate polls or polling averages have been in the past - Wang makes several assumptions about how polls behave that don't check out against the data.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Silver specifically argues that, by building so little uncertainty into his model, Wang's projections don't present an accurate estimate of the chances that the polls may be wrong — either in certain races or overall. He argues that Wang's 2010 model estimated absurdly low probabilities for events that actually ended up happening — Sharron Angle losing to Harry Reid and the GOP picking up 63 seats in the House.</p> \n<p>One of Silver's broader points is that his model makes extensive use of historical data about how much polls have been off by in the past — because it's not at all infrequent for polls to miss the mark. Wang's model, though, doesn't take this into account.  ""There are many elections in which all or almost all polls are biased in the same direction,"" Silver writes, adding that Wang ""underestimates the chance for the underdog to win because of systematic errors in the polls, better-than-expected turnout, and so forth.""</p> \n<p>Update: Check out a response from Wang <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2014/09/17/nate-silver-versus-sam-wang/"">here</a>, courtesy of the Washington Post's Greg Sargent.</p> \n<div align=""center""> \n<p><a href=""http://www.vox.com/a/election-2014-forecast""><chorus-asset class=""chorus-snippet browser_wide_media"" data-id=""815890""> <img alt=""Battle for Congress"" class=""small"" src=""http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/815890/BattleforCongress-inArticle-Door.0.png""></chorus-asset></a></p> \n</div>",Politics
The rift between Obama and his generals on ISIS,http://www.vox.com/2014/9/18/6338589/obama-generals-isis-iraq,It looks like there's growing daylight between the military brass and the White House on deploying combat troops to Iraq. A look back at the Afghanistan war shows why that's a huge deal.,"<p>There's no mistaking what President Obama's Wednesday speech at MacDill Air Force Base was: a gigantic slap in the face to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Martin Dempsey. But to be fair, Dempsey slapped first when he publicly dissented from the administration's position on deploying combat troops to fight the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS). Obama's latest speech shut him down.</p> \n<p>The font of the disagreement was Dempsey's Tuesday testimony at a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing, during which he said he'd ""recommend"" a US combat deployment to fight ISIS <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/9/16/6226401/iraq-ground-troops-obama"">under certain circumstances</a>. In a short, fiery portion of his Wednesday remarks — the above video — Obama restated his opposition to this plan in no uncertain terms. ""I will not commit you and the rest of our armed forces to fighting another ground war in Iraq,"" the president said definitively.</p> \n<p>But this isn't just about a few stray remarks from Dempsey. Obama's comments reveal a profound fault line between the president and the military on the use of force and the fundamental theory behind Obama's war against ISIS.</p> \n<h3>Remember Afghanistan?</h3> \n<p><chorus-asset class=""chorus-snippet browser_wide_media"" data-id=""653456""> <img alt=""US soldier helicopter Afghanistan SHAH MARAI/AFP/Getty Images"" class=""small"" src=""http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/assets/4895680/453545176.jpg""> </chorus-asset></p> \n<p class=""caption"">An American soldier in a helicopter over Afghanistan. Shah Marai/AFP/Getty Images</p> \n<p>Tension between Obama and the armed forces on troop deployments is nothing new. Back in 2009, when Obama was trying to figure out what to do about the war in Afghanistan, top military officials demanded a troop-intensive counterinsurgency plan well before Obama was ready to commit to it.</p> \n<p><span>Bob Woodward's book </span><i style=""line-height: 1.5;"">Obama's Wars</i><span> has the goods here. ""</span><span>Not only General [Stanley] McChrystal but General [David] Petraeus and others, including Admiral [Michael] Mullen, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, had kind of piled on: 'Well, this is the way we should do it,'"" Woodward </span><a href=""http://www.npr.org/2010/12/13/132030072/clashes-with-pentagon-shaped-obama-s-wars"">said</a><span> in an interview with NPR. </span></p> \n<p><span>The White House went, according to Woodward, ""ballistic."" According to his reporting, ""they felt they were being boxed in or really kind of cornered by the uniformed military."" The Obama administration eventually settled on committing fewer troops than the military wanted  but more than Vice President Joe Biden's limited counterterrorism plan called for, ultimately satisfying no one. </span></p> \n<h3>Obama is afraid of Afghanistan 2.0 in Iraq and Syria</h3> \n<p><chorus-asset class=""chorus-snippet browser_wide_media"" data-id=""641916""> <img alt=""Afghanistan special forces JOHANNES EISELE/AFP/Getty Images"" class=""small"" src=""http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/assets/4517045/463316923.jpg""> </chorus-asset></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Afghan special forces in Kabul. Johannes Eisele/AFP/Getty Images</p> \n<p>There's a decent chance the Afghanistan experience explains what happened this week. According to <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/countering-islamic-state-will-be-hard-in-iraq-and-harder-in-syria-officials-say/2014/09/10/de74d448-3943-11e4-9c9f-ebb47272e40e_story.html"">the Washington Post</a>, the general in charge of the Middle East theater, Lloyd Austin, had asked for ground troops and got shot down by Obama personally. That, together with Dempsey's comments, might have the White House worrying about a replay of 2009.</p> \n<p>So they reacted forcefully. After Dempsey's comments, a Pentagon spokesman sent an email to reporters <a href=""http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/09/17/are-obama-and-his-generals-on-the-same-war-plan.html"">essentially correcting the chairman</a>, saying that Dempsey ""believes the current strategy to counter [ISIS] is appropriate"" and wasn't recommending a combat deployment. The White House Press Secretary <a href=""https://twitter.com/BrettLoGiurato/status/511945341563056128"">told reporters</a> that Dempsey was talking about a ""hypothetical situation,"" and reaffirmed that Obama ""will not deploy ground troops in Iraq and Syria.""</p> \n<p>Then, the next day, Obama said the same thing in even stronger terms. This looks an awful lot like a concerted White House effort to prevent the military from pushing them into an escalation they oppose.</p> \n<h3>Obama vs. the military on ISIS</h3> \n<p><chorus-asset class=""chorus-snippet browser_wide_media"" data-id=""645550""> <img alt=""Iraqi troops MOHAMMED SAWAF/AFP/Getty Images"" class=""small"" src=""http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/assets/4644829/450851042.jpg""> </chorus-asset></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Iraqi troops training. Mohammed Sawaf/AFP/Getty Images</p> \n<p>It helps, though, that Obama outlined <i>why</i> he opposed a troop deployment in his Wednesday speech. That shows that Obama isn't just afraid of the political consequences of troop escalation, but also the policy ones. Basically, <span>Obama wants to avoid another disaster in Iraq. Here's the critical portion of the speech:</span></p> \n<blockquote style=""margin: 0 0 0 40px; border: none; padding: 0px;""> \n<p>After a decade of massive ground deployments, it is more effective to use our unique capabilities in support of our partners on the ground so they can secure their own country's future. And that's the only solution that will succeed over the long term.</p> \n<p>We'll use our air power. We will train and equip our partners. We will advise them and we will assist them. We will lead a broad coalition of countries who have a stake in this fight. Because this is not simply America versus [ISIS] — this is the people of the region versus [ISIS].</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan prove that the massive ground forces can't keep insurgencies down. The American invasion of Iraq didn't destroy ISIS. If anything, it gave birth to it. And the nearly decade and a half long occupation of Afghanistan has failed to destroy either al-Qaeda or the Taliban. <span>As a result, Obama's view isn't just that combat troops are risky. It's that the record suggests they actually wouldn't help that much.</span></p> \n<p>Instead, Obama proposes that the US support reliable local forces. While American troops will eventually have to come home, Iraqi troops conveniently live in Iraq. So Obama wants to train, supply, and assist them — but not take their place on the front lines.</p> \n<p>This really does look like a good-faith disagreement with the military, which appears to have a rosier view of America's ability to help conduct counterinsurgency operations against ISIS in Iraq.</p> \n<h3>Are they both wrong?</h3> \n<p><chorus-asset class=""chorus-snippet browser_wide_media"" data-id=""677568""> <img alt=""454301122.0.jpg"" class=""small"" src=""http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/677568/454301122.0.jpg""> </chorus-asset></p> \n<p class=""caption"">President Obama (Alex Wong/Getty Images)</p> \n<p>Obama's position isn't unreasonable. A <a href=""http://www.jasonlyall.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Rage_Final.pdf"">2009 paper</a> by Yale political scientist Jason Lyall and Colonel Isaiah Wilson III, a West Point professor, looked at a dataset of 286 insurgencies between 1800 and 2005. <span>They found that, since World War I, counterinsurgents have tended to lose and foreign occupying troops have a particularly bad success record when fighting local insurgencies. </span></p> \n<p><span>Given America's history in Iraq, and the fact that Iraq's Prime Minister </span><a style=""line-height: 1.5; background-color: #ffffff;"" href=""http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/M/ML_IRAQ?SITE=AP&amp;SECTION=HOME&amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT"">opposes</a><span> the use of American combat troops, it wouldn't be surprising if Iraqis treated American combat troops like an occupying force.</span></p> \n<p>So it's perfectly reasonable for Obama to believe that sending ground troops to Iraq wouldn't guarantee ISIS's defeat. But this analysis seems to imply that, in general, defeating a group like ISIS will be very difficult. This makes the president's commitment to eventually ""destroy"" ISIS somewhat puzzling.</p> \n<p>Obama himself <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/8/9/5983249/iraq-obama-isis-strategy"">has argued</a> that political problems, not the sheer military ineffectiveness of the Iraqi army, is fueling ISIS's strength, and neither he nor anyone else has <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/9/11/6135595/obama-isis-syria-iraq-strategy-politics-war"">a feasible plan</a> for fixing the Iraqi government. According to an anonymous member of Congress quoted in <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/09/17/cia-syria_n_5834850.html?utm_hp_ref=tw"">the Huffington Post</a>, ""The CIA thinks that it is impossible to train and equip a force of pro-Western Syrian nationals that can fight and defeat [Bashar al-]Assad, al-Nusra [Syria's al-Qaeda franchise], and ISIS."" The CIA has been wrong before, of course, but independent evidence also <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/9/11/6135595/obama-isis-syria-iraq-strategy-politics-war"">paints a pretty grim picture</a>.</p> \n<p>This doesn't mean that ISIS is invincible. <a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/isis-myths-iraq/isis-invincible"">They're far from it</a>. Rather, it means that destroying ISIS outright — rather than severely weakening its ability to hold territory and launch attacks — may be outside of America's power.</p>",Politics
Senate Democrats get some very bad news in the latest polls,http://www.vox.com/2014/9/18/6361383/senate-forecast-update-iowa-colorado-louisiana,Some GOP candidates post their best numbers yet.,"<p>It's been one day since we launched our <a href=""http://www.vox.com/a/election-2014-forecast"">election forecasting hub</a>. In the week or so before that, the polling news had generally been good for Democrats. As a result, the forecasting models — including those that had tended to favor Republicans — were <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/9/17/6153603/senate-election-forecasting-2014-guide-republicans-chances"">mostly showing</a> slight Democratic leads or pure 50-50 tossups. <span>But when new polls come out, these models move too — and after one very bad day of polling for Democrats, the models are moving towards the GOP:</span></p> \n<p><a href=""http://www.vox.com/a/election-2014-forecast""><chorus-asset class=""chorus-snippet browser_wide_media"" data-id=""964608""> <img alt=""Senate forecasts 9-18-14"" class=""small"" src=""http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/964608/Screen_Shot_2014-09-18_at_8.35.40_AM.0.png""> </chorus-asset></a></p> \n<p>The biggest movements were a 7 point gain for the GOP in <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/newsgraphics/2014/senate-model/#outcomes"">the Upshot's model</a>, and a 9 point gain in the <a href=""http://www.dailykos.com/poll-explorer/2014-senate"">Daily Kos model</a>. Now, these movements are still small. But both of these models are now giving the GOP a very narrow edge, which they weren't yesterday.</p> \n<h3>Why the models moved</h3> \n<p>Yesterday, Democrats got bad polling news in three key races — Iowa, Colorado, and Louisiana.</p> \n<p>In Iowa and Colorado, t<span>he GOP candidates — Joni Ernst and Cory Gardner —hadn't led a single poll in weeks. </span><span>But yesterday, a new Iowa poll showed a tied race, and another showed Ernst ahead by six points — a bigger lead than her opponent Bruce Braley has had in </span><a href=""http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/2014-iowa-senate-ernst-vs-braley"" style=""line-height: 1.5; background-color: #ffffff;"">any recent poll</a><span>. </span></p> \n<p><span>Meanwhile, in Colorado, one poll showed Gardner down by only 2, and another showed him ahead by one.

S</span><span>everal other polls mentioned here are from Fox News. </span><span>But the forecasters, for the most part, don't pick and choose which polls to include, since that could easily turn into cherry-picking. They prefer including many polls and then relying on polling averages — and these new data points move those averages. In Iowa, almost every modeler now shows Ernst with a slight lead.</span></p> \n<p><span></span><span>This new polls should be taken as provisional.

But speaking at a Center for American Progress panel Thursday morning alongside Patty Murray, Kirsten Gillibrand, Nancy Pelosi, Rosa de Lauro, and CAP president Neera Tanden, Hillary Clinton tested a potentially potent fusion of feminism framing and populist policy that shows how artificial the division between ""economic issues"" and ""social issues"" really is.</p> \n<p>""Women hold two-thirds of all minimum wage jobs,"" Clinton observed, and ""nearly three-quarters of all jobs that are reliant on tips"" and thus <a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/minimum-wage-explained/minimum-wage-exceptions"">eligible for sub-minimum wages</a>.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""right""><span>putting a gender equity frame forward is a good way to bolster support for the welfare state</span></q></p> \n<p>Clinton discussed the plight of a working-class mother with a service-sector job that provides low pay and little flexibility. ""We talk about a glass ceiling,"" she said, ""but these women don't even have a secure floor under them.""</p> \n<p>Indeed, while people can debate the <a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/gender-wage-gap-men-women-pay/why-is-there-a-gender-wage-gap"">precise origins of the gender wage gap</a>, there's no denying that women earn substantially <a href=""http://www.vox.com/xpress/2014/9/16/6222047/we-have-a-new-wage-gap-number-but-not-a-new-wage-gap"">less than men</a> on average. Social safety net programs and income redistribution initiatives are disproportionately beneficial to low-wage workers, and low-wage workers are mostly women.</p> \n<p>American political discourse often associates the gender gap in voting with abortion rights and other ""women's issues"" that specifically highlight sex or gender. But as political scientist Karen Kauffman <a href=""http://books.google.com/books?id=Xp7JkbGbnI0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Unconventional+Wisdom:+Facts+and+Myths+about+American+Voters&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Hqn8TriyJebg0QHblYW2Ag&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=equal%20rights&amp;f=false"">has shown</a>, these issues do not particularly seem to divide men and women. Instead, starting in the Reagan-era, men, but not women, have been attracted by the Republican Party's tilt against the welfare state. Libby Copeland offered an excellent <a href=""http://www.slate.com/articles/double_x/doublex/2012/01/the_gender_gap_in_politics_why_do_women_vote_differently_than_men_.html"">overview of this literature</a> for Slate in 2012, but it remains largely unappreciated by political journalists. Further evidence for the primacy of economics comes from international comparisons. Ronald Inglehart and Pippa Norris show that women's voting <a href=""http://hassler-j.iies.su.se/pub/EdinburgConf/441.pdf"">has skewed left</a> in all advanced industrial economies.</p> \n<p>Why is this? Torben Iversen and Frances Rosenbluth <a href=""http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~iversen/PDFfiles/IversenRosenbluth2006.pdf"">offered a plausible explanation</a> in a 2006 article, writing that the ""partial socialization of family work, even at the cost of higher taxes from the private sector, increases a woman's ability to work outside the home and thereby increases her exit options and her household bargaining position.""</p> \n<p>In other words, because conventional social norms leave the care of children and the elderly to women, the expansion of the welfare state to shoulder some of that burden not only helps the directly assisted, it helps women by saddling them with less unpaid work.</p> \n<p>This is, of course, not exactly how Clinton put it. But during the discussion she referred to the Nixon-era push for a universal childcare program, inspired by a desire to grow the economy by increasing women's workforce participation rate. Clinton said that after being initially supportive, the White House found itself pressed to veto the bill ""on ideological grounds not on evidence."" Proponents of traditional patriarchal family arrangements, in other words, feared exactly the Iverson/Rosenbluth dynamic. More generous social provision might make the economy richer, but it would also shift the intra-family balance of power away from men and toward women.</p> \n<p>At a time when activist government was broadly in vogue, highlighting the implications for family life was enough to sink the proposal. Clinton's calculation seems to be broadly the opposite — that putting a gender equity frame forward is a good way to bolster support for the welfare state at a time when the <a href=""http://themonkeycage.org/2013/02/26/the-real-story-on-public-support-for-government-spending/"">national mood is swinging toward smaller government</a>.</p>",Politics
Democrats hoping to keep the Senate just got great news from the Kansas Supreme Court,http://www.vox.com/2014/9/18/6426473/kansas-senate-supreme-court-decision,A ruling says their candidate's name can be dropped from the ballot.,"<p>On Thursday afternoon, in a decision with potentially crucial implications in the battle for the Senate, the Kansas Supreme Court ruled that the dropped-out Democratic nominee's name must be removed from the ballot. This decision is just the outcome Democrats wanted, because it paves the way for a two-way contest between Republican Senator Pat Roberts and independent candidate Greg Orman. You can read the decision <a href=""http://www.kscourts.org/Cases-and-Opinions/opinions/SupCt/2014/20140918/112431.pdf"">here</a>.</p> \n<p>The Democratic candidate, Shawnee County District Attorney Chad Taylor, had won the nomination back when the race didn't appear competitive. He was viewed as a weak contender with little shot of winning. But after several polls came out showing unexpectedly bad numbers for Roberts — and strong numbers for Orman, a wealthy businessman and former Democrat — Taylor filed to withdraw from the race, which would allow Orman to take on Roberts one-on-one.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""right"">The court's ruling was unanimous</q></p> \n<p>However, Republicans soon argued that Taylor didn't withdraw properly. They pointed out that the law allowing withdrawal only refers to nominees who declare ""that they are incapable of fulfilling the duties of office."" And they argued that Taylor's short letter of withdrawal didn't specifically mention anything about being incapable. Therefore, Secretary of State Kris Kobach argued, the law required that he keep Taylor's name on the ballot. But Kobach — a conservative Republican known for his <a href=""http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052748704816604576333650886790480"">strong support</a> of voter ID laws — is a member of Pat Roberts' honorary campaign committee, so he was questioned about why he didn't recuse himself from the decision. (Kobach <a href=""http://www.kansas.com/news/politics-government/election/article2108031.html"">argued</a> that ""these honorary committees are just usually meaningless."")</p> \n<p>Why was the GOP fighting so hard to keep a dropped-out candidate's name on the ballot? Well, past precedents indicate that, if Taylor's name stayed, he likely wouldn't have gotten too many votes — but he could have gotten somewhere in the low single digits, enough to potentially tip a close race to Roberts. (Check out one analysis of similar situations from Daily Kos poster Taniel <a href=""http://www.dailykos.com/story/2014/09/04/1327244/-Non-candidate-candidates-What-happens-when-you-drop-out-but-stay-on-the-ballot"">here</a>.) Recent <a href=""http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/2014-kansas-senate-roberts-vs-orman-vs-taylor"">polls</a> have shown Taylor drawing between 6 and 11 percent of the vote.</p> \n<p>The ballots had to be printed by Saturday, September 20, so they could be sent to members of the military — so the Kansas Supreme Court heard the case. The court has 4 sitting justices who were appointed by Democrats and 2 by Republicans. And oral arguments <a href=""http://electionlawblog.org/?p=65498"">didn't seem to go well</a> for the GOP. Taylor's letter, the justices pointed out, made specific reference to the statute he was using to withdraw from the race. So, the justices asked, why did he have to use the particular word ""incapable,"" if he was clearly referencing that statute? They also pointed out that several other candidates had been permitted to withdraw in the past even though none of them explicitly said they were incapable of serving.</p> \n<p>The court's ruling ended up being unanimous — Taylor's name had to be dropped. However, the statute also says that if a nominated candidate withdraws, the party should hold a convention to pick a new nominee. The court didn't rule on whether Democrats had to do that. But, just minutes after the ruling, Kobach announced that he would give them 8 days to pick a new nominee, according to Wichita Eagle reporter <a href=""https://twitter.com/BryanLowry3/status/512723360870981632"">Brian Lowry</a>. He also <a href=""https://twitter.com/BryanLowry3/status/512722314765406209"">announced</a> that he would delay the mailing of the ballots one more week to allow time for this.</p> \n<p><i>This post has been updated with new developments.</i></p> \n<div align=""center""> \n<p><a href=""http://www.vox.com/a/election-2014-forecast""><chorus-asset class=""chorus-snippet browser_wide_media"" data-id=""815890""> <img alt=""Battle for Congress"" class=""small"" src=""http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/815890/BattleforCongress-inArticle-Door.0.png""></chorus-asset></a></p> \n</div>",Politics

Sure, the GOP incumbent Pat Roberts might be trailing in recent polls, especially now that the Democratic candidate has </span><a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/9/18/6426473/kansas-senate-supreme-court-decision"">dropped out</a><span>, with his support likely to go to independent candidate Greg Orman. </span><span>But Roberts only won his primary by 8 points.

3 reasons why New Zealand has the best-designed government in theÂ world,http://www.vox.com/2014/9/23/6831777/new-zealand-electoral-system-constitution-mixed-member-unicameral,"It's better at electing people, it's better at running legislatures, and the fact that there's a Queen is a feature, not a bug.","<p>We in the US tend to assume that — however awful we might think our politicians are — our political <i>system</i> is excellent. The Constitution is held in high esteem across the political spectrum, and Democrats and Republicans alike pay lip service to the ""genius"" of the Founders. But our system, combining two powerful legislative bodies with a strong executive, is pretty rare internationally. Indeed, it appears to be a weaker model than most; the US is the just about the only country to <a href=""http://scholar.harvard.edu/levitsky/files/1.1linz.pdf"" target=""_blank"">sustain a presidential system for a long period without descending into dictatorship</a>.</p> \n<p>We can learn a lot from other countries' models, which are often more streamlined and democratically representative than our own. The best of the bunch, in my judgment: New Zealand.</p> \n<h3>The world's best electoral system</h3> \n<p><span>If you pay any attention at all to American politics, you know that Republicans have a healthy majority in the House of Representatives, with 246 seats (56.6 percent) to Democrats' 188 (43.2 percent; one seat is vacant). But their popular vote margin — 51 percent to 45.3 percent — was about half the size of their seat margin.</span></p> \n<p><span>The differential was even more dramatic in 2012. </span><span>House Republicans lost the popular vote, with 47.6 percent to Democrats' 48.8 percent, that year, even as they won a sizable majority of seats. That's not a particularly common occurrence, but it does happen from time to time; in 1996, Democrats also won the popular vote for the House while not gaining a majority or plurality of seats.</span></p> \n<p>The standard explanation for why this kind of thing happens is that Democratic House districts tend to be more Democratic, on average, than Republican districts are Republican. That means that Democratic votes are ""wasted"" running up the margins in safe districts, whereas Republican votes are spread out enough to garner more seats-per-vote. Reasonable people can differ over the extent to which this pattern is explained by <a href=""http://www.slate.com/blogs/weigel/2014/09/08/gerrymandering_and_the_big_sort_fallacy.html"">gerrymandering</a> or the fact that Democrats tend to naturally <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/07/upshot/why-democrats-cant-win.html"">cluster together geographically</a> (I'd argue that a fair districting system would take the latter into account but that's another matter).</p> \n<p><span>But the fact that it leads to obvious injustices is hard to deny. It's not fair to Democrats living in rural Texas, or Republicans living in Manhattan that they will almost certainly never be represented by someone with their political views. It's not fair to Democrats and Republicans living in their own parties' safe districts that their votes count for less than if they lived in swing districts. It's not fair to those in swing districts who lose narrowly; if, say, a Democrat wins a seat 51 percent to 49, that means roughly half the district isn't seeing their interests represented.</span></p> \n<p><iframe frameborder=""0"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/8Uk44aykGg4"" height=""480"" width=""853""></iframe></p> \n<p class=""caption"">How New Zealand's government explains its electoral system to voters.</p> \n<p>This is not an inevitable feature of the political system, and as Reihan Salam noted in Slate, most other countries have devised a solution: <a href=""http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/09/abolish_the_single_member_district_that_s_the_best_way_to_ensure_truly_fair.html"">proportional representation</a>. There are a bunch of different ways to do this. One is creating multi-member districts, and then having voters rank candidates through a process known as single transferable vote (STV); this is what Rob Richie and the team at FairVote, the main US lobbying group on this question, <a href=""http://www.fairvote.org/reforms/fair-representation-voting/"">advocate</a>. The simplest system would be pure party-list representation, as practiced in the Netherlands and Israel, in which there are no districts, voters choose parties rather than candidates, and parties get roughly the same percentage of seats as they did votes; a milder version, as used in Spain and Norway, does this at the district level.</p> \n<p>Either of these would be huge improvements over the US status quo. But neither is ideal. Single transferable vote systems are party-agnostic and can't ensure that parties are represented in proportion to the votes they received as well as a party-list system can. But pure party-list systems can lead to a destabilizing proliferation of small parties which are able to extract promises from the bigger parties in exchange for joining their coalitions.</p> \n<p>Party-list systems make it hard for a single party to get a majority, which means that if, say, a party has 45 seats out of 100, it still needs to win over a party with 6 seats to govern. The 6 seat party then has significant power to demand stuff, out of proportion to its actual level of support. So ironically, this form of proportional representation can have patently undemocratic consequences. Stuff like this has <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/01/23/the-secret-behind-israels-dysfunctional-political-system/"">happened frequently in Israel</a>, with fairly deleterious results.</p> \n<p>The best proportional representation (PR) system, then, is a twist on party-list voting known as mixed-member PR, or MMP for short. MMP has voters select both a candidate in their local district and a party they'd like to win a majority. Everyone who wins a district gets a seat, and then additional seats are given out to ensure that parties are represented in proportion to their share of the party vote. This has a number of advantages. Unlike party list representation, people still have representatives with at least some ties to their area, for whatever that's worth.</p> \n<div class=""align-right"">\n<chorus-asset class=""chorus-snippet browser_wide_media"" data-id=""1398718""> <img alt=""new zealand ballot"" class=""small"" src=""http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/1398718/Sample_20ballot_20paper.0.jpg""> </chorus-asset> \n<p class=""caption"">A sample New Zealand ballot, with a column for party voting and a column for candidate voting. (Electoral Commission New Zealand)</p> \n</div> \n<p><span></span>But more importantly, it means parties have to be organized enough to compete in a decent number of districts in order to have a shot. That discourages the kind of excessive party formation that happens under pure party-list representation, while still ensuring that smaller parties get some say.</p> \n<p>Germany and New Zealand both use MMP, and the result in each case is a slightly altered version of a two-party system. It's rare for the major parties in either country to get an outright majority (though it appears the National Party might in New Zealand), but typically they have enough ideological allies in smaller parties to form a government nonetheless. Germany also has a tradition of grand coalitions between its two main parties, but New Zealand shows the system can work even when there isn't that kind of bipartisan collaboration (as, let's be honest, there wouldn't be in a hypothetical United States with MMP). Neither country has faced problems with government formation of the kind nations using purer party list systems often do. In 2011,<span> New Zealand held a </span><a style=""line-height: 1.5; background-color: #ffffff;"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_voting_system_referendum,_2011"">nonbinding referendum</a><span> on its voting system, and voters opted to stay with MMP by a wide margin.</span></p> \n<p>It's worth emphasizing how rare MMP is: only four countries (Germany, New Zealand, Lesotho, and Romania) use it. And none of the other three can claim New Zealand's other big advantage…</p> \n<h3>Unicameralism</h3> \n<center> \n<p><chorus-asset class=""chorus-snippet browser_wide_media"" data-id=""1398738""> <img alt=""john key parliament"" class=""small"" src=""http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/1398738/490681337.0.0.jpg""> </chorus-asset></p> \n<p class=""caption"">New Zealand prime minister John Key on the floor of parliament — New Zealand's wonderful, single-house parliament. (Hagen Hopkins/Getty Images)</p> \n</center> \n<p>The worst thing about the United States Senate — besides its history as a bulwark for slavery and white supremacy, its flagrant violation of the principle of ""one person, one vote,"" and its general contempt for even the most basic norms of fairness and equal representation — is that it's totally useless. All upper houses are. Lower houses of parliament are completely capable of drafting and passing laws on their own. See: New Zealand.</p> \n<p><span>New Zealand isn't alone in having a unicameral parliament. Sweden, Norway, Finland, Portugal, Denmark, Israel, Iceland, and Taiwan do as well, to name a few. But it stands out for being unicameral while still modeled after the British system. Britain's House of Lords has gradually seen its power wane over the centuries, while Australia opted to foolishly give its upper house a patina of democratic legitimacy, and thus a greater claim to power, by making it directly elected. Canada has contented itself with a Senate that's more or less </span><a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/07/09/think-our-senate-is-horrible-wait-til-you-see-canadas/"">always been useless</a><span>. But New Zealand decided to get it over with and cut the damn thing out altogether.</span></p> \n<p>This may seem like a small thing, and it certainly is compared to truly impotent bodies like the House of Lords. But even weak upper houses can typically delay legislation if they want to, and force changes on occasion. Germany's Bundesrat, for example, has an <a href=""http://books.google.com/books?id=kFTjpT-LZGAC&amp;lpg=PA142&amp;ots=Q1E6kjmnC5&amp;dq=bundesrat%20veto&amp;pg=PA142#v=onepage&amp;q=bundesrat%20veto&amp;f=false"">absolute veto over constitutional changes</a>; in other cases, if the Bundesrat rejects a bill passed by the Bundestag (the lower house) with a two-thirds majority, the Bundestag has to muster a two-thirds majority itself to overrule the veto. That puts New Zealand over the top; not only does it, like Germany, have mixed member proportional representation, but unlike Germany it doesn't have a meddlesome upper house. The sole legitimate democratic institution is the one elected to proportionately represent the population.</p> \n<h3>Monarchy</h3> \n<center> \n<p><chorus-asset data-id=""1398768"" class=""chorus-snippet browser_wide_media""> <img src=""http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/1398768/800px-Swearing_in_ceremony_for_new_Govenor_General_of_New_Zealand_2C_Lieutenant_General_Sir_Jerry_Mateparae_-_Flickr_-_NZ_Defence_Force.0.jpg"" class=""small"" alt=""Jerry Mateparae""> </chorus-asset></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Governor-General Jerry Mateparae at his swearing-in.

Generally speaking, in a parliamentary system, you need a head of state who is not the prime minister to serve as a disinterested arbiter when there are disputes about how to form a government — say, if the largest party should be allowed to form a minority government or if smaller parties should be allowed to form a coalition, to name a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008%E2%80%9309_Canadian_parliamentary_dispute"">recent example from Canada</a>. <span>That head of state is usually a figurehead president elected by the parliament (Germany, Italy) or the people (Ireland, Finland), or a monarch. And </span><a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/07/23/shut-up-royal-baby-haters-monarchy-is-awesome/"">monarchs are better</a><span>.</span></p> \n<p>Monarchs are more effective than presidents precisely because they lack any semblance of legitimacy. It would be offensive for Queen Elizabeth or her representatives in Canada, New Zealand, etc. to meddle in domestic politics. Indeed, when the Governor-General of Australia did so in 1975 it <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1975_Australian_constitutional_crisis"">set off a constitutional crisis</a> that made it clear such behavior would not be tolerated. But figurehead presidents have some degree of democratic legitimacy, and are typically former politicians. That enables a greater rate of shenanigans — like when Italian president Giorgio Napolitano schemed, successfully, to <a href=""http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052970203391104577124480046463576"">remove Silvio Berlusconi as prime minister</a> due at least in part to German chancellor Angela Merkel's entreaties to do so.</p> \n<p>Napolitano is the rule, rather than the exception. Oxford political scientists Petra Schleiter and Edward Morgan-Jones have <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/07/23/shut-up-royal-baby-haters-monarchy-is-awesome/"">found</a> that presidents, whether elected indirectly by parliament or directly by the people, are likelier to allow governments to change without new elections than monarchs are. In other words, they're likelier to change the government without any democratic input at all:</p> \n<center> \n<p><chorus-asset class=""chorus-snippet browser_wide_media"" data-id=""1396360""> <img alt=""government dissolution"" class=""small"" src=""http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/1396360/constitutionalmonarchy_replacement.0.png""></chorus-asset></p> \n</center> \n<p>New Zealand would already top the list of best political systems even if it were a republic.

Electric vehicles would need to handle about 75 percent of all trips. The coal plants that remained would all capture their carbon-dioxide emissions and bury them underground.</p> \n<p>The UN report noted that a shift this wrenching was technologically feasible — though it becomes far more expensive if we rule out specific technologies, like nuclear or carbon capture for coal.

Here's the key exchange:</span></p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>WEISBERG: I'm not sure how to ask this, but a lot of people who admire and respect you wonder if you'll resign while President Obama is in office.</p> \n<p>GINSBURG: Who do you think President Obama could appoint at this very day, given the boundaries that we have? If I resign any time this year, he could not successfully appoint anyone I would like to see in the court. [The Senate Democrats] took off the filibuster for lower federal court appointments, but it remains for this court. So anybody who thinks that if I step down, Obama could appoint someone like me, they're misguided. As long as I can do the job full steam....

However, <span>since </span><span>the Democrats are certain to lose at least three Senate seats this fall — and <a href=""http://www.vox.com/a/election-2014-forecast"">likely a couple more</a> — it will surely only be more difficult for him to get a nominee confirmed next year. </span></p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""right"">The current 55-seat majority Democrats have is actually pretty big for recent decades</q></p> \n<p>What about after 2016?

But according to a Wednesday report from the Washington Examiner's <a href=""http://washingtonexaminer.com/romney-2016-is-for-real/article/2553932"">Byron York</a>, that may have been premature. <span>""Romney is talking with advisers, consulting with his family, keeping a close eye on the emerging '16 Republican field, and carefully weighing the pluses and minuses of another run,"" York reports. ""</span><span>That doesn't mean he will decide to do it, but it does mean that Mitt 2016 is a real possibility.""</span></p> \n<p><span>York adds that Romney ""is said to believe"" that, apart from himself, only former Florida Governor Jeb Bush has a shot at winning the White House for the GOP.

Itâ€™s not crazy for Mitt Romney to run for president again,http://www.vox.com/2014/9/26/6843697/mitt-romney-president-2016-explained,Here's why it actually makes sense.,"<p>Mitt Romney has effectively been running for president since his only successful election to a political office — the Massachusetts governorship — back in 2002. That's roughly a decade spent pursuing the White House. Now, a new report by the Washington Examiner's Byron York <a href=""http://washingtonexaminer.com/romney-2016-is-for-real/article/2553932"">suggests</a> Romney is seriously thinking of trying again.</p> \n<p>Pundits are mocking the return of Romney's ambitions. But given how the Republican 2016 field is shaping up, where Romney's poll numbers are, and the advantages he brings as a former nominee, Romney 2016 isn't being taken as seriously as it deserves to be. <span>Here are six reasons it makes sense for Romney to consider running again.</span></p> \n<h3>1) <span>The GOP field has weakened over the past year, and there's no clear frontrunner</span>\n</h3> \n<div align=""center""> \n<p><chorus-asset class=""chorus-snippet browser_wide_media"" data-id=""1402146""> <img alt=""Romney and Chris Christie"" class=""small"" src=""http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/1402146/136581669.0.jpg""> </chorus-asset></p> \n</div> \n<div style=""text-align:center""> \n<p class=""caption"">Christie campaigns for Romney in 2012. (Emmanuel Dunand/AFP/Getty)</p> \n</div> \n<p>Though it's frequently been argued that Republicans have a strong field of potential contenders for 2016, a true frontrunner has yet to emerge, either in polls or among the party elites, activists, and interests who will help choose the nominee. No candidate has yet managed to reach even the low bar of 25 percent support <a href=""http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/2016_republican_presidential_nomination-3823.html"">in any national poll</a>, and we're not seeing early endorsements from key party figures (like we're seeing with Democrats endorsing <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2014/05/02/sen-tim-kaine-backs-hillary-clinton-for-president-in-2016/"">Hillary Clinton</a>).</p> \n<p>Even more importantly, several candidates who had hoped to gain the support of the party's establishment wing have weakened over the past year, as <a href=""http://jonathanlast.com/romney-2016-3/"">Jonathan Last</a> argues. <span>Christie's image was badly hurt by </span><a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/chris-christie-scandals-explained/what-is-bridgegate-fort-lee-traffic-scandal"" style=""line-height: 1.5;"">Bridgegate</a><span>, Marco Rubio hasn't won back the trust of activists since co-authoring the Senate's bipartisan immigration reform bill, and Scott Walker is facing a tough reelection in addition to his </span><span>own </span><a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/6/20/5825162/scott-walker-john-doe-criminal-scheme"" style=""line-height: 1.5; background-color: #ffffff;"">investigatory troubles</a><span>. Meanwhile, Paul Ryan seems to want to stay in the House and chair the powerful Ways and Means Committee. </span></p> \n<p><span>It's still possible that one of these candidates could manage to become the establishment choice — especially Christie, as federal prosecutors have reportedly found </span><a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/9/18/6438063/christie-bridgegate-no-evidence"">no evidence</a><span> tying him to the bridge scandal. But it hasn't happened yet. </span><span>Which means Romney has an opening to become the pick of the establishment, or at least a substantial piece of it.</span></p> \n<h3>2) A Jeb Bush run looks unlikely</h3> \n<div align=""center""> \n<p><chorus-asset class=""chorus-snippet browser_wide_media"" data-id=""634260""> <img alt=""Jeb Bush"" class=""small"" src=""http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/assets/4256047/155066158.jpg""> </chorus-asset></p> \n</div> \n<div style=""text-align:center""> \n<p class=""caption"">Jeb Bush in 2012.

So there seems to be at least one candidate who would definitively win Romney's support. </span></p> \n<p><span>But while there have been </span><span>several trial balloons for a Jeb Bush candidacy </span><a href=""http://www.cbsnews.com/news/jeb-bushs-team-signals-possible-2016-presidential-run/"">floated</a> recently, there are <a href=""http://dyn.politico.com/printstory.cfm?uuid=A050D0E8-5EF4-4B58-BCD3-87566A64DE83"">reasons to be skeptical</a> he'll actually pull the trigger.

For now, Bush has every reason to encourage speculation that he's running. It gives him increased media attention, perceived clout, and it makes him more valuable as a speaker and rainmaker. But he's at odds with the GOP base on issues like immigration and Common Core, and he's </span><a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/25/us/politics/jeb-bush-returns-to-fray-and-finds-going-rough.html"" style=""line-height: 1.5; background-color: #ffffff;"">suggested</a><span> that concerns from his family could be an issue. </span><span>So Bush might well opt against a run, and Romney could feel that he's the party's only hope.</span></p> \n<h3>3) GOP voters and donors already know him</h3> \n<div align=""center""> \n<div><chorus-asset class=""chorus-snippet browser_wide_media"" data-id=""1402074""> <img alt=""Romney and Paul Singer, 2009"" class=""small"" src=""http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/1402074/91004549.0.jpg""> </chorus-asset></div> \n<div style=""text-align:center""> \n<p class=""caption"">Romney and top GOP donor Paul Singer in 2009.

He ended up quitting the race in August.</span></div> \n<div><br></div> \n<div>Romney, on the other hand, is known to practically every Republican voter and already has relationships with most of the party's leading donors. Additionally, he has a core group of supporters in finance and business, and most of them ""have decided not to commit to any other 2016 candidate until they hear a definitive word from Romney,"" York writes. Plus, Romney remains personally wealthy. So he's likely to have no problems either financing a campaign or standing out from a crowded field to the electorate.</div> \n<h3>4) Romney can argue that he was prescient on foreign policy</h3> \n<div align=""center""> \n<p><iframe width=""420"" height=""315"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/Bw6I7MWYKV4"" frameborder=""0""></iframe></p> \n</div> \n<p>Already, many conservatives are arguing that the various foreign policy crises of this year have vindicated Romney's past arguments. <span>In the clip above, </span><a href=""http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/388656/biden-2012-romney-wants-go-war-syria-ian-tuttle"" style=""line-height: 1.5; background-color: #ffffff;"">posted</a><span> by Ian Tuttle of National Review, Vice President Biden mocks Romney for opposing an end to the war in Iraq, being ""ready to go to war in Syria,"" </span><span>and wanting ""to move from cooperation to confrontation with Putin's Russia.""

The fatal flaw in Obama's plan to let unauthorized immigrants into the military,http://www.vox.com/2014/9/26/6847119/dreamers-enlist-military-daca-mavni-allowed-how-many,The new program might help a few dozen immigrants â€” but there's a catch that could disqualify them.,"<p>On Thursday, the <a href=""http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/09/25/policy-to-allow-undocumented-immigrants-in-military/16225135/"" target=""_blank"">Obama administration announced </a>that it was going to allow unauthorized immigrants who have already been protected from deportation (under the <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/8/18/5999601/deferred-action-obama-immigration-daca"" target=""_blank"">Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA)</a> to serve in the military.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""right"">a catch-22 might make it impossible for any immigrant to enlist under the new program</q></p> \n<p>The announcement was something that some young unauthorized immigrants, or DREAMers, have been waiting to hear for years. They'd been frustrated that, since 2012, many of them had been able to work legally in the US under DACA, but hadn't been able to serve in the armed forces. And they'd gotten their hopes up when <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/5/30/5766012/the-pentagon-is-letting-some-unauthorized-immigrants-join-the-military"" target=""_blank"">news had leaked in May</a> that the administration was going to allow them to serve — only to have the administration <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/5/31/5768526/white-house-puts-brakes-on-immigrant-enlistment-plan/in/5532563"" target=""_blank"">put that plan on hold </a>less than a day later.</p> \n<p>But when it comes to the details, it turns out the administration's move will, in a best-case scenario, only affect a very limited number of DREAMers — an estimated ""few dozen,"" in the words of one leading advocate. And that's, again, the best-case scenario. In the worst-case scenario, a catch-22 could make it impossible for any DACA recipient to enlist under the new program at all.</p> \n<h3>The best-case scenario: a few dozen immigrants can enlist</h3> \n<p>What the Obama administration is doing is expanding an existing program for certain types of immigrants: the Military Accessions Vital to the National Interest program, or MAVNI.</p> \n<p><q class=""right"" aria-hidden=""true"">The program is only open to immigrants with very particular skills</q></p> \n<p><span>Currently, MAVNI is only open to legal immigrants. The Obama administration is now opening it up to unauthorized immigrants — as long as they have protection under the deferred-action program — as well. </span><span>But MAVNI is only open to immigrants with very particular skills: they have to be experts in a particular foreign language (Spanish doesn't count), or have medical expertise.</span></p> \n<p>There are ""DACAmented"" immigrants who have expertise in an uncommon language, or want to go into health care. But medical colleges have only started accepting them, meaning that no DACAmented immigrant will have the medical degree needed for MAVNI for several years. And it's not clear at all how many of the DACAmented immigrants who <i>want to serve</i> in the military will qualify through the language requirement.</p> \n<p>Cesar Vargas of DRM Action Coalition, who's been the most visible ""military DREAMer"" since he ""came out"" as unauthorized in 2010, said that of all the would-be immigrant service members he's in touch with, he only knows of two people who could be eligible for MAVNI under the current restrictions.</p> \n<h3>Even those immigrants may get excluded because of their families</h3> \n<p>Having the skills for the program is, relatively speaking, the easy part. The hard part is that the military places restrictions on anyone — even a US citizen — who has any unauthorized immigrants in his or her family. <span>Because DACA recipients generally came over as children with their parents, it's hard to think of a ""DACAmented"" immigrant who </span><i style=""font-size: 15.5555562973022px;"">wouldn't </i><span>have any unauthorized-immigrant relatives. </span></p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""right"">""items that cause 'failure' (on the background check) include having undocumented relatives""</q></p> \n<p><span>Cesar Vargas says that some branches of the armed forces take the current restrictions on enlisting more seriously than others: ""It's not uniform. Some people have undocumented siblings, or undocumented parents, and they're fine,"" he says. ""I've heard the Marines are pretty tough. US citizens are getting turned away"" if their relatives don't have the right immigration status.</span></p> \n<p><span>But for immigrants who are trying to apply under the MAVNI program, the immigration status of their relatives might not be something a recruiter can wave off — because it's part of a mandatory background check. As Margaret Stock, an immigration lawyer who came up with the idea of the MAVNI program to begin with, </span><a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/5/31/5767936/problem-obama-plan-let-immigrants-serve-military-mavni-daca/in/5532563"" target=""_blank"">explained to me in May</a><span>:</span></p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>As of 2012, the requirements for enlisting under MAVNI include what's called a ""Single Scope Background Investigation,"" or SSBI — an investigation used throughout the government, usually to give people security clearances. And according to Stock, it's impossible for an unauthorized immigrant, with or without temporary ""deferred action"" protection, to pass an SSBI.</p> \n<p>""SSBI items that cause 'failure' include having undocumented relatives, as well as any 'law violations',"" Stock writes in an email to Vox. ""I don't see how any DACA can 'pass' unless the contractor doing the investigation ignores his or her instructions.""</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p><span>In theory, the military (or at least the branches of it that are currently taking a more lenient attitude toward citizens with unauthorized relatives) could choose to ""override"" the requirement in the background check. But t</span><span>hat means, for the ""few dozen"" DACA recipients that Vargas estimates might qualify for MAVNI, getting approved for the background check will be a massive risk.</span></p> \n<p><span>In order to apply, they'll have to tell contractors which of their relatives aren't in the US legally. Even if that's not going to make them ineligible to enlist — which looks like a pretty big ""if"" — that could be a pretty big chilling effect on them wanting to apply at all. And e</span><span>ven those immigrants who manage to jump through all those hoops are still fighting for a limited number of slots, as I wrote in May:</span></p> \n<blockquote>Additionally, Stock notes, only 1,500 immigrants a year are currently able to enlist under MAVNI — and there are ""16,000 legal immigrants currently vying for the few hundred slots left"" between now and September. So even if any unauthorized immigrants are able to pass the investigation, they'd have to compete with legal immigrants for the remaining slots.</blockquote> \n<h3>Advocates' reaction: ""Nice Try""</h3> \n<p>For all of these reasons, many of the politicians and advocates who had been asking Obama to allow DREAMers to serve in the military are taking the news as a defeat.</p> \n<p>Rep. Luis Gutierrez (D-IL), the biggest supporter of executive action on immigration in Congress, released a statement Thursday saying that the administration has ""decided not to let DACA recipients enlist in the military except in very limited circumstances."" And United We Dream, one of the leading DREAMer advocacy groups, titled <a href=""http://unitedwedream.org/press-releases/united-dream-white-house-nice-try/"" target=""_blank"">their statement </a>""Nice Try.""</p> \n<p>Gutierrez' statement floated one possibility: ""Maybe after the season of midterm elections passes and the Obama Administration makes a top-to-bottom review of its immigration policies and its ability to make adjustments under current law this matter will be revisited.""</p> \n<p>That suggests that Gutierrez and advocates aren't giving the administration any credit for making this move before the midterms. And it suggests that the advocates and Latinos who are waiting for the administration to do something really big on immigration aren't going to stop holding their breath.</p>",Politics
"Before 1987, politicians' affairs weren't a big deal. After, they almost ended a presidency",http://www.vox.com/2014/9/28/6851885/gary-hart-matt-bai-donna-rice-scandal-affair-marriage-journalism,You may not have ever heard of Gary Hart. But his downfall helped makes politics what it is today.,"<p>In 1987, former Colorado Senator Gary Hart had his political career derailed by reports of an affair with 29-year old model Donna Rice. He was forced out of the race for the 1988 Democratic presidential nomination after being the heavy favorite following a close second-place finish in 1984. He restarted the campaign later that year, but he performed miserably and has been out of the public eye ever since.</p> \n<p>Hart's fall is old news, but Yahoo! politics reporter Matt Bai's <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/All-Truth-Is-Out-Politics/dp/0307273385""><i>All the Truth Is Out</i></a> — set to be released this Tuesday and <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/21/magazine/how-gary-harts-downfall-forever-changed-american-politics.html"">excerpted in the New York Times magazine</a> — argues that the scandal marked a fundamental turning point in American politics and political journalism, away from a world in which Franklin Roosevelt and John F. Kennedy's affairs weren't even reported upon and toward one in which Bill Clinton was impeached for lying about his. Bai notes that when the Washington Post's Paul Taylor asked Hart at a press conference in Hanover, NH, ""Have you ever committed adultery?"" it was the first time a presidential candidate had ever faced that kind of query. It represented an increased focus on politicians' personalities and character, a shift whose implications <i>All the Truth Is Out</i> explores in depth.</p> \n<p>Bai and I spoke Thursday about Hart, his scandal, and how it changed American political life.</p> \n<p><b>DM: For readers who may be unfamiliar with Gary Hart — who maybe weren't even alive when he ran — what makes him distinctive? What did he bring to the table that was so unique?</b></p> \n<p>MB: He was a really important political figure at the time. He was described to me once as the most important American politician of his age who didn't become president, and I think that's almost unquestionably true. You don't have Bill Clinton and Clintonism without Hart first, though Hart doesn't always like the comparison. He was the first of that '60s generation to hit the very pinnacle of national politics.</p> \n<p>He was the first to talk about reforming the military for the post-Cold War period; he was the first to talk about stateless terrorism as a gathering threat; he was the first to talk about transitioning the economy from manufacturing to something more information based, and how that technology was going to change things. He had and has an innate ability to see around corners and to connect various strains of American society to what needs to happen in government.</p> \n<p>He spent a lot of time — as much time as any candidate for the presidency <span>I know of</span><span> — thinking not just about the political dynamic, but how he would actually govern. The people engaged in the process at that time would say he was a remarkable candidate intellectually. Even the people who don't like Hart, even the people who don't think he was fit to serve because of his personal life, would concede he's a visionary. And we don't have a lot of visionaries in presidential politics.</span></p> \n<p><b>DM: Early in the book, you quote an interview Hart gave to Sally Quinn when he was George McGovern's campaign manager in 1972, where he said that he and his wife Lee had a ""reform marriage."" There's </b><a href=""http://prospect.org/article/media-bias"">one view</a><b> in which Hart did nothing wrong at all. He had an open marriage, the media didn't understand, and even if he had an affair with Donna Rice it wasn't a big deal, because he wasn't betraying his wife or anything. Was that your interpretation of what happened?</b></p> \n<p>MB: It's an interesting question. As I say in the book, there are a bunch of explanations for why Hart may have put himself in the position he did, and I don't think he will ever reflect on that with himself or with others.</p> \n<p>But we know that he and his wife — who, by the way, are still married and have been married more than 50 years — separated twice before that campaign. They spent long periods apart. Much of his reputation as a Washington casanova was earned during the two periods when he and his wife were not together, during which he slept on Bob Woodward's couch for a while, and nobody wrote about it. <span>I think it's very likely that he did not consider the marriage to be traditional or binding in the way some marriages were, and it's very possible that he did not feel that he was acting immorally.</span></p> \n<p>I don't think it's reasonable to look back at Hart and say he was idiotic, he should have known he'd get caught. When you look back at his body of experience — having worked on the Church Commission, having been McGovern's campaign manager, having been in the Senate, having been separated from his wife a couple of times, having dated openly in Washington with nothing written about it, having run for president in 1984 and become the single most talked-about politician in America for months without anybody writing about any of this — it becomes reasonable from his perspective to think this stuff wasn't going to become a topic for journalists, or if it was, they certainly weren't going to go searching out the evidence for it. In hindsight, it's easy to dismiss that, but if you look at it in that moment, it makes a lot more sense.</p> \n<center> \n<p><iframe style=""border:none;"" scrolling=""no"" height=""360"" width=""640"" src=""http://abcnews.go.com/video/embed?id=10125133""></iframe><br><a href=""http://abcnews.go.com/video"">More ABC news videos</a> | <a href=""http://abcnews.go.com/international"">Latest world news</a></p> \n<p class=""caption"">A 1987 ABC News report on the end of Hart's campaign. Hart would resume it later that year, but perform poorly, finishing in seventh in New Hampshire after winning the state by ten points four years earlier.</p> \n</center> \n<p><b>DM: What was it about 1987 that the media attitude toward politicians' personal lives shifted this radically? Was it just happenstance or were there factors explaining why this didn't become an issue in 1984 but did three years later?</b></p> \n<p>MB: <span>You had a profound, reverberating effect from Watergate, which created a whole new focus on personal morality in politicians that really hadn't been there before. You had changing attitudes about adultery because of the women's liberation movement and the debate over the Equal Rights Amendment. All of a sudden, the afternoon tryst wasn't okay anymore.</span></p> \n<p>You had these really fundamental changes in the media after Watergate, because you have a whole new generation of journalists coming in who really want to be Woodward and Bernstein, and really want to expose politicians and report on scandals. That becomes their highest calling. <span>You have the <i>The McLaughlin Group</i> premiering around that time, and <i>Crossfire</i> debuts around then. You suddenly have this new thirst among people in my industry to get famous in a way that they hadn't before.</span></p> \n<p><span>You have the advent of satellite technology. That's the first presidential campaign where fly-away satellite dishes are the industry standard. That begins to redefine news, since once you can go anywhere and you can report a story at any moment, you want to keep people in their seats, and you want to break new turns in the story, and it becomes like a soap opera.</span></p> \n<p><span>In the months before the Hart scandal, you had the scandal with Jim and Tammy Faye Bakker, the celebrity preacher and wife, with the mascara-streaked face on Nightline; it was like the most viewed interview ever. You had the whole drama with Oliver North and his secretary Fawn Hall smuggling out documents in her skirt. That overtook the facts of Iran-Contra in the public's mind, which was a massive scandal.</span></p> \n<p><span>You could see, in retrospect, a really remarkable intersection of trends that are combining to put a lot of pressure on the political media to delve into the worlds of what had traditionally been entertainment and tabloidism.</span></p> \n<p><b>DM: A lot of people would argue the primary problem with the press isn't that it gangs up on politicians, as it did to Gary Hart, but the opposite, that journalists are too chummy with politicians. The problem isn't the Washington Post's Paul Taylor asking Gary Hart if he had committed adultery, the problem is that Gary Hart used to sleep on Bob Woodward's couch. And you could argue the changes in political reporting you're documenting were for the better in that respect.</b></p> \n<p>MB: These are complex issues. I tend to traffic in complexities, not in easy answers. There is a case to be made that things were not better in the old days. I don't dismiss that at all.</p> \n<p>There are things about the old era of politics and political journalism that give me pause, and would give a lot of people pause. There was a lot of chumminess and protection. You can very reasonably ask whether the public was well-served not knowing about John Kennedy's associations.<span> I don't think there's an easy answer there.</span></p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""right"">he was willing to give up his own life's dream because he was holding to a principle</q></p> \n<p><span>In the years since the Hart scandal in 1987, the focus of political journalism has shifted away from an interest in ideas and world views and how they were shaped, and much more toward trying to expose the lies and flaws that we know are there, because there's a lot of reward in our industry for doing that.</span></p> \n<p>In some cases the flaws are real, as in John Edwards' case, and you do a real service by exposing them. But very often we lose context for the full scope of a human life, rather than just one moment, and we get fixated on things that may or may not be relevant to a person's fitness to serve. Under this banner of character, we've become really focused on a kind of destruction.</p> \n<p>The result of that, ultimately, are a lot of people who don't want to be engaged in the process, and a lot of candidates that are so cautious or so narcissistic and driven to run that they lack the dimension we want in our leaders. Gary Hart said in 1987, when he left the race, that he worried, in the words of Thomas Jefferson, that we would get the leaders we deserve. That's a <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/1987/05/09/us/transcript-of-hart-statement-withdrawing-his-candidacy.html"">speech</a>, however dismissed at the time, that people should revisit.</p> \n<center> \n<p><iframe frameborder=""0"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/ACYq7gWjFFc"" height=""480"" width=""640""></iframe></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Gary Hart appears on Real Time with Bill Maher on August 13, 2004.</p> \n</center> \n<p><b>DM: The book makes it clear that Hart really wanted to return to national politics, and it's sort of bizarre that someone of his stature didn't play much of a role in either the Clinton or Obama administrations. What accounts for that? Why was he not rehabilitated?</b></p> \n<p>MB: It's kind of crazy and not great for the country, because I think there was a lot of service still to be rendered there. There are a lot of reasons you can point to, but it came down to the fact that he got stuck in time.</p> \n<p>It's hard for someone who wasn't there, and I count myself in that group since I was very young, to understand what a national joke he was, and what it was to be a national joke at the moment when institutions like Johnny Carson and the evening news and entertainment media were so unifying. We didn't have market fragmentation. The whole country watched Johnny Carson, and Johnny Carson made fun of him endlessly, and so did everyone else. Because Hart was the first to get caught up in something like that at the presidential level, he really got stuck in that moment and became politically toxic.</p> \n<p>There was a path. There were years where, as other politicians made clear later, he could have probably recovered his political prospects by going on an apology tour, or coming clean in a memoir, doing an interview with Oprah, or any number of other things that politicians would do later. And he just wouldn't. He believed it wasn't anybody's business, and he thought it was beneath him. You can sit around and debate whether that was a reasonable position to take in the modern era, but I think it's ironic to assail his character if he was willing to give up his own life's dream because he was holding to a principle. I think that defines character, in a lot of ways.</p> \n<p><b>DM: It does seem like it's easier for people to recover from scandal than it used to be. David Vitter admitted to hiring prostitutes and is probably the next governor of Louisiana. Is that because there's nothing like Carson or the nightly news that everyone watches? Is something else happening?</b></p> \n<p>MB: The ensuing years created a playbook for getting out of scandal and disgrace, whatever it was, whether it was sex or financial or because you said something stupid one day, whatever disgrace befell you. Everybody knew what they had to do. You had to apologize, and to disappear for a little while, and you'd write a book or go on a publicity tour. Entire agencies are devoted to rebuilding peoples' images.</p> \n<p>Some people point to that and say, ""We figured out how to get past this."" People face disgrace and then they come back. Hart didn't for whatever series of reasons, but we worked through it as a country. But you have to ask yourself, and I think it's a very profound question, what kind of politician, what kind of leader is willing to do that? And is that the kind of leader you want to attract to your politics and your government?</p> \n<p>How many people do you know, psychologically healthy people, who are willing to discuss the innermost aspects of their personal lives, and grovel to their families in public, and put their families through repeated humiliation, because they just <i>have</i> to achieve their career ambition? How normal is that? What kind of politician does it reward?</p> \n<p><b>Correction: </b>This post originally stated that the photo of Donna Rice and Gary Hart forced him out of the race in 1988; he left due to the scandal but not due to the photo.

Latinos are pissed at Obama â€” but theyâ€™re still getting out the vote,http://www.vox.com/2014/10/3/6895727/obama-heckler-video-latino-voters-colorado-turnout,The people most betrayed by the president are the ones who are still working to get out the vote for his party,"<p>Last night, when President Obama spoke at the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute press gala, he looked like he practically expected to get heckled over his decision to delay executive action (which could include <a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/obama-immigration-executive-action-amnesty-congress/obama-immigration-reform-executive-order-amnesty"" target=""_blank"">relief for millions of unauthorized immigrants</a>) until after the election. When a protester finally <a href=""http://fusion.net/story/19540/obama-tells-frustrated-latinos-im-going-to-need-you-to-have-my-back/"" target=""_blank"">stood up and shouted</a> ""Mr. President, stop the deportations. We need relief now,"" he looked less surprised than weary. After all, his <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/9/7/6116367/obama-immigration-strategy-work-republicans-delay-elections"" target=""_blank"">rocky relationship with immigration-reform groups</a> has caused him to get heckled many times during his administration. You can see the exchange starting at about 29 minutes, here:</p> \n<p><iframe frameborder=""0"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/RtlwEIBFguA"" height=""315"" width=""560""></iframe></p> \n<p>It was clear from last night's speech that Latino leaders are frustrated with Obama — and that Obama is a little frustrated with their frustration. Democrats are growing concerned that Latino voters are too upset with the president to vote for his party in November — and that could cost the Democrats at least one key Senate race. <span>Last night, Obama placed the responsibility on Latino leaders to get Latinos out to vote. ""if we want [immigration reform] legislation to happen sooner rather than later, then there's one more thing I need you to do — I've got to have you talk to your constituents and your communities, and you've got to get them out to vote.""</span></p> \n<p>But just because Obama got heckled at an event full of Latino leaders doesn't mean those leaders aren't making an effort to get Latino voters to support Democrats. It's definitely true that Latino voters are frustrated with Obama and the Democrats right now, but that's more of a long-term problem for Democrats than a short-term one. Here are three key reasons why:</p> \n<h3>1) The people in the room with Obama are also the ones who are still mobilizing voters for Democrats</h3> \n<p><chorus-asset class=""chorus-snippet browser_wide_media"" data-id=""693480""> <img alt=""Voter registration Latinos"" class=""small"" src=""http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/693480/57659391.0.jpg""> </chorus-asset></p> \n<p class=""caption"">The ""ground game"" is one way to appeal to the Latino vote. (David McNew/Getty)</p> \n<p>Here's the fundamental paradox among immigration reformers. For the most part, the people who follow policy closely enough to feel most betrayed by President Obama are also the people who follow politics closely enough to understand how important it is that Republicans not control Congress. That's true of advocates and organizers outside DC as well.</p> \n<p>So, for example, in Colorado — the one 2014 Senate race in a state with a large Latino population — the Colorado Immigrant Rights Coalition is simultaneously organizing civil disobedience against Sen. Michael Bennet, who isn't up for re-election this year, and trying to mobilize thousands of Latino voters to turn out for Sen. Mark Udall, who is.</p> \n<p>As I <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/9/11/6132141/election-democrats-senate-hispanic-voters-colorado"" target=""_blank"">wrote last month</a> about the Colorado race:</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>The good news for Democrats is that in Colorado - the one Senate race where Latino anger might be a problem - there's a very strong voter-mobilization effort. ""Our movement, especially here in Colorado, has had a proven track record of turning out voters,"" says Sonia Marquez of the Colorado Immigrant Rights Coalition. She points to the state legislature, which has become heavily pro-immigrant over the past few years.</p> \n<p>[...]Marquez admits that Democrats have ""made it very difficult for us to go out in the community and explain this to (Latinos), to try to energize people as to why they should even turn out.""</p> \n<p>But at the end of the day, she says, she thinks what really drives Latinos to the polls is a desire to make their voices heard: ""Even though it's a challenge, we know that voting will continue to grow our power. And I truly believe that that's what's turning out Latino and API voters in our state."" And having a ground game to remind Latinos of that duty certainly doesn't hurt.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<h3><span>2) It would take a massive drop in turnout to swing a race</span></h3> \n<p><chorus-asset class=""chorus-snippet browser_wide_media"" data-id=""641002""> <img alt=""latino voters polls"" class=""small"" src=""http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/assets/4483165/155665757.jpg""> </chorus-asset></p> \n<p><a style=""font-size: 15.5555562973022px; line-height: 1.5;"" href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/9/11/6132141/election-democrats-senate-hispanic-voters-colorado"" target=""_blank"">Ground game matters</a><span> for elections: political scientists think that voter-mobilization efforts are as important as the party's actual policies. But voter mobilization can't be separated from enthusiasm — and despite the efforts of the organizers, Latino <i>voters </i>in Colorado aren't enthusiastic about voting. </span></p> \n<p><span></span>Marquez isn't as optimistic about turnout as she was a few weeks ago. ""The last few weeks of September were kind of a challenge,"" she admits. ""People say, 'We don't really see the value in voting, neither one of them are on our side.'"" Her organizers are still doing their best to tell voters that voting ""is the way we build our power and make change,"" but right now it seems that enthusiasm is genuinely low.</p> \n<p>But in order for low enthusiasm among one voter group to really shake up a race, it would have to result in a massively lower turnout. Because Latinos vote so heavily for Democrats, it would take a huge reduction in turnout to really turn a Democrat's margin of victory into a margin of defeat.</p> \n<p>The <a href=""http://coloradopols.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PPP-ATF-Colorado-poll-analysis.pdf"" target=""_blank"">most recent poll in Colorado </a>that breaks down Latino preferences (conducted by left-leaning pollster Public Policy Polling) has Mark Udall losing to Republican challenger Cory Gardner. But it's not because of a drop in Latino support — the poll shows that voters who have made up their minds prefer Udall by a margin of 3.5 to 1. More importantly, it estimates that Latinos will make up 14 percent of the electorate — which would require them to turn out as heavily as they did in the presidential election year of 2012.</p> \n<p>In such a close election, turnout will still matter a great deal — and that's why organizers are working so hard to get Latinos to turn out for Udall.

Running on a hawkish platform would certainly be a challenge to Senator Rand Paul, who <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/9/19/6532197/republican-presidential-candidates-foreign-policy-isis"">remains critical</a> of US interventions in the Middle East.</p> \n<p>But Graham's comments about another potential candidate from the Senate are perhaps even more interesting than his own potential bid. Marco Rubio was viewed as a top contender as 2013 began, but his chances were damaged when conservatives lost trust in him over the support of the Senate immigration reform bill. <span>Graham, who agreed with Rubio on immigration and </span><a href=""http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/06/24/getting-to-maybe"">worked closely with him</a><span> on that bill, has also lost confidence in him — for caving too quickly to the right, Hayes writes:</span></p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>I asked Graham about Rubio. Hasn't he been making many of the arguments you'd be likely to make? Graham wasn't impressed. ""He's a good guy, but after doing immigration with him-we don't need another young guy not quite ready,"" said Graham. ""He's no Obama by any means, but he's so afraid of the right, and I've let that go.""</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Graham has been frequently criticized by Tea Party and conservative groups, but earlier this year, he won his primary easily.</p>",Politics

As a result, <a href=""http://www.pbs.org/race/000_About/002_03-godeeper.htm"">they could justify</a> their own rights and freedoms while enslaving, excluding, and otherwise mistreating people who had been placed in different racial categories.</p> \n<p>So the division of people into groups based on general geographical origins of their ancestors or descriptions of the way they look, is the basis of a manmade strategy for making sense of treating some people better than others.</p> \n<h3>2) The way we legally define different races in America can change on a whim — and it has</h3> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""2340122"" alt=""shutterstock_145306411.0.jpg"" src=""http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2340122/shutterstock_145306411.0.jpg""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">(<a href=""http://www.shutterstock.com/pic-145306411/stock-photo-portrait-of-a-young-man-relaxing-on-sofa-at-home.html?src=1DMVxwMAAnmo-sZ0ZR-i7w-1-58"">Shutterstock</a>)</p> \n<p>If race were based on permanent, innate divisions of human beings, the American government wouldn't have to constantly scramble to change the definitions and qualifications for each category.</p> \n<p>But it does.

Since then, their status — white or Hispanic — <a href=""http://www.pbs.org/race/000_About/002_03_c-godeeper.htm"">has flip-flopped several more times</a>, all depending largely on whatever the current thinking was about their role in labor or immigration.</p> \n<p>Similarly, courts <a href=""http://www.pbs.org/race/000_About/002_03_c-godeeper.htm"">went back and forth</a> in the early 20th century about whether people from Japan were white, finally deciding in 1933 that they weren't, based on ""the common understanding of the white man."" (Sounds really official, huh?)</p> \n<p>And what it took to be ""black"" <a href=""http://www.pbs.org/race/000_About/002_03-godeeper.htm"">once varied</a> so wildly throughout the country (from one-quarter, to one-sixteenth, to the infamous one drop of African ancestry) that people could actually change races by crossing state lines.</p> \n<p>Then, suddenly, in 2000, the government decided that Americans could be more than one race, adding options to express this to the Census. In other words, one day you could be a single race, and the next day you could be as many as you pleased.</p> \n<p>With these constant changes, it's hard to make the case that the concept of race is anywhere near stable.</p> \n<h3>3) Once upon a time, some people from Europe were ""not quite white""</h3> \n<p><img src=""http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2339916/shutterstock_154966967.0.jpg"" alt=""shutterstock_154966967.0.jpg"" data-chorus-asset-id=""2339916""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">(<a href=""http://www.shutterstock.com/pic-154966967/stock-photo-statue-of-liberty.html?src=dncWoe2ZKC_5XJ5hvgrMJA-1-43"">Shutterstock</a>)</p> \n<p>Today, the term ""European"" is treated as largely interchangeable with ""white"" in America.

There's no question about whether race informs Americans' experiences with education, employment, the justice system, and countless other measures.

Yet you have researchers studying high blood pressure, asthma among blacks, etc. and looking for a genetic cause. However, research shows these [illnesses] are the effects of racial inequality and the stress of racial inequality ... Of those who say [race is biological], they usually point to sickle cell anemia, as proof that illnesses are race-based. Even if you look at these genetic diseases that seem to run along with race, it's actually caused by environment. Sickle cell is an adaptation in areas with high rates of malaria.

Obama has passed more major legislation than perhaps any president since Lyndon Johnson — and, at least as of yet, there's no Vietnam War to mar his legacy. The history of the Obama administration will be hard to write, as so many of its chapters will demand their own books (indeed, some, like the stimulus, have already <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/The-New-Deal-Hidden-Change/dp/1451642326"">gotten them</a>). Most crucially, Obamacare itself looks headed for success — <span>and that, plus preventing the financial crisis from turning into another Great Depression, is a legacy in itself</span><span>.</span></p> \n<p>That said, Obama's greatest successes — and his most serious failures — lie in the dense mass of his first two years. This is the time, in Krugman's telling, before Obama grokked the nature of the Republican opposition and ""began dealing with it realistically.""

Virtually every achievement Krugman recounts — the health-care law, the Dodd-Frank financial reforms, the financial rescue, the stimulus bill — passed in these first two years when Democrats held huge majorities in congress. And every item on the list passed over screaming Republican opposition. The first two years of the Obama administration are the story of Obama being haunted by his promises of a postpartisan presidency, and choosing, again and again, to pass bills at the cost of worsening partisanship.</p> \n<h3>The irony of Obama's presidency</h3> \n<p>As Reid Cherlin, a former Obama administration staffer, <a href=""http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/the-presidency-and-the-press-20140804"">put it</a>, ""[T]hey have managed over six years to accomplish much of what Obama promised to do, even if accomplishing it helped speed the process of partisan breakdown."" The engine of Obama's political rise, going all the way back to his 2004 keynote at the Democratic National Convention, was that the conflictual nature of politics was the product of the people who knew no politics other than conflict. The <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/8/6/5974807/the-deep-irony-of-barack-obamas-presidency-in-one-sentence"">central irony</a> of Obama's presidency is he proved himself wrong.</p> \n<p>Obama promised to reform the health-care system and regulate the financial sector by fixing American politics. Instead, he did it by breaking American politics further. The candidate who ran for office promising to heal Washington's divisions became the most divisive president since the advent of polling:</p> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""2341308"" alt=""Obama gallup polarizing"" src=""http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2341308/obama_gallup_polarizing.0.gif""></p> \n<p class=""caption""><a href=""http://www.gallup.com/poll/160097/obama-fourth-year-office-ties-polarized-ever.aspx"">Gallup</a></p> \n<p>It's not just partisanship.

""Because it's a game that ordinary Americans are losing. It's a game where lobbyists write check after check and Exxon turns record profits, while you pay the price at the pump, and our planet is put at risk.""</p> \n<p>Lobbyists still write their checks in Obama's Washington. The health-reform bill got done by cutting side deals with pharmaceutical companies and insurers.

A newly-released Clinton memo reveals how presidential appointments really work,http://www.vox.com/2014/10/11/6959825/clinton-memo-supreme-court-mario-cuomo,"""To what extent do we conduct a 'search' if the President has made up his mind?""","<p>On Friday, Bill Clinton's presidential library <a href=""http://www.clintonlibrary.gov/previouslyrestricteddocs.html"">released</a> a new set of previously-restricted internal documents from his administration. <a style=""background-color: #ffffff;"" href=""http://www.clintonlibrary.gov/assets/storage/Research%20-%20Digital%20Library/formerlywithheld/batch7/2006-0188-F.pdf"">One of those memos</a>, from March of 1993, gives a fascinating glimpse into how Ruth Bader Ginsburg almost wasn't nominated for the Supreme Court.</p> \n<p>The memo deals with a vacancy on the court that arose early in Clinton's first year, when Justice Byron ""Whizzer"" White announced his retirement. Soon afterward, Clinton had a meeting with advisers, and, as Jeffrey Toobin wrote in his book <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/The-Nine-Inside-Secret-Supreme/dp/1400096790"">The Nine</a><span>:</span></p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>""Look,"" [Clinton] said, ""the Court is totally fragmented and it's dominated by Republican appointees...

I want someone like that.""</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>In that meeting, Clinton quickly decided that the person he wanted was... New York Governor Mario Cuomo.</p> \n<p>But Supreme Court appointments are so important that the president needs to <i>appear</i> to consider several candidates, and get outside advice from others. <span>So, in the </span><a href=""http://www.clintonlibrary.gov/assets/storage/Research%20-%20Digital%20Library/formerlywithheld/batch7/2006-0188-F.pdf"">newly-released memo</a>, which was<span> written three days after the meeting Toobin describes, </span><span>Associate White House Counsel Ron Klain grapples with the challenge of making the administration seem to have an open mind. </span></p> \n<p><span></span><span>""To what extent do we conduct a 'search' if the President has made up his mind?"" Klain asked. ""Do we cast a broad net for prospective candidates if the outcome is basically preordained?"" The name of Clinton's choice is redacted in the memo, but it's clear from the reporting of Toobin and others that it was Cuomo.  Here's the plan Klain laid out:</span></p> \n<ul> \n<li> <b style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5;"">Kiss Senate rears</b><span>: Several important senators and particularly Judiciary Committee Chairman Joe Biden had made ""their desire to be consulted"" quite clear.

""It should also reflect geographic, gender, racial, and professional diversity. We should assume that the list, in its entirety, will be leaked to the press.""</span> </li> \n<li> <b style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5;"">Get women to cover you for not picking a woman</b><span>: Klain suggests that Clinton call senators Dianne Feinstein and Carol Moseley-Braun because ""we will need them to back us up if we do not choose a woman.""</span> </li> \n<li> <b style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5;"">Get a secret sneak preview of top lawyers' reaction</b><span>: ""Before we proceed with"" Cuomo, Klain writes, ""We should ask the ABA [American Bar Association] for a 24-hour 'read' on him: an informal process whereby they poll their Committee members and give us a 'sense' of their likely evaluation of him. This would be confidential on both sides (we could not disclose that we had done this), and would not prevent the ABA from issuing a lower rating later.""</span> </li> \n</ul> \n<div>The White House effectively offered the nomination to Cuomo a few days later, but he couldn't decide whether to accept it. He delayed answering for several days, before briefly saying yes but then sending a letter withdrawing his name from consideration.</div> \n<div><br></div> \n<div>After several other possibilities were explored, without success, Clinton finally decided to ask his rarely-consulted attorney general, Janet Reno, for advice. ""Why aren't you people looking at Ruth Bader Ginsburg?"" she asked. Ginsburg soon impressed Clinton, and he decided to nominate her for the seat — though not before Cuomo returned to the picture one more time.

He pointed to Google CEO Eric Schmidt and Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg as examples of powerful people who previously defended government and corporate invasions of privacy but have also taken steps — refused to talk to some media, or bought massive properties to make outside snooping more difficult — to protect themselves from peering eyes.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""right"">""There are all sorts of things that we do and think that ... we would be mortified for the rest of the world to learn""</q></p> \n<p>""All of us have things to hide,"" Greenwald said.

""After all, if you're not a bad person, if you're doing nothing wrong, you should have nothing to hide,"" Greenwald quipped.

And voter ID is like stop-and-frisk in one important respect: it's a race-neutral policy in theory, but in practice it ends up disproportionately harming people of color.</p> \n<p>A 2012 report by the Brennan Center for Justice found that African Americans and Hispanics were generally less likely to have ID than the average American, meaning that the burden of getting a new ID after a state law passed falls heavily on them.

People of color are more likely to be disenfranchised by these laws since they are less likely to have photo ID than the general population...(In some of the states with strict voter-ID laws), many part-time ID-issuing offices are in the rural regions with the highest concentrations of people of color and people in poverty.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p><span>The good news for opponents of voter ID laws, though, is that in the short term, the future of voter ID isn't in the hands of the public. Instead, it's in the hands of the federal courts.</span></p> \n<h3>Voter-ID lawsuits are racing against the election clock</h3> \n<p><span>In the last few years, a wave of state legislatures — most of them dominated by Republicans — have passed new, restrictive voter ID laws. These laws have been challenged by voting-rights groups. Eight states are in the middle of court battles over whether their laws can go into effect.

Texas appealed, and an <a href=""http://www.cnn.com/2014/10/15/politics/texas-voter-id-law/index.html"" target=""_blank"">appeals court ruled on October 15th</a> that the law will be allowed to go into effect.

The earlier ruling helps make the case that Texas can't be trusted to make non-discriminatory voting laws on its own, and therefore needs to go back to getting preclearance — a permission slip, essentially — from the federal government before it can make any voting changes. (In 2013, the Supreme Court gutted the portion of the Voting Rights Act that mandated such a permission slip for <a href=""http://www.justice.gov/crt/about/vot/sec_5/covered.php"">certain states and counties</a>, including Texas, with a history of discrimination.)</p> \n<p><span></span><span>Another recent decision in federal court upheld Wisconsin's voter ID law, but the Supreme Court </span><a href=""http://www.jsonline.com/news/opinion/after-voter-id-decision-the-focus-should-be-on-compliance-b99366849z1-278702531.html"" target=""_blank"" style=""font-size: 15.5555562973022px; line-height: 1.5; background-color: #ffffff;"">swiftly issued</a><span> a ruling that the law still couldn't go into effect just yet. </span><span>And in the long run, the ruling upholding the Wisconsin law might not be as notable, or as influential, as the dissent from Judge Richard Posner.</span></p> \n<h3>""If the Wisconsin legislature says witches are a problem, shall Wisconsin courts be permitted to conduct witch trials?""</h3> \n<p><span>Posner is a conservative, appointed by Ronald Reagan, and is partly responsible for the current wave of state voter ID laws — he wrote the first decision saying that they were constitutional, back in 2008.

If the Wisconsin legislature says witches are a problem, shall Wisconsin courts be permitted to conduct witch trials? If the Supreme Court once thought that requiring photo identification increases public confidence in elections, and experience and academic study since shows that the Court was mistaken, do we do a favor to the Court — do we increase public confidence in elections — by making the mistake a premise of our decision?</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>In another passage, Posner sums up the paradox behind support for voter ID: it ignores, or tries to make excuses for, the real problem of discouraging people from voting legally, in service of trying to fix the imaginary problem of voter fraud.</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>The panel opinion states that ""if photo ID is available to people willing to scrounge up a birth certificate and stand in line at  the office that issues driver's licenses,  then  all we  know  from  the fact  that  a particular person lacks  a photo  ID is  that he was unwilling to invest the necessary time."" But that ignores Sobel's study, discussed earlier, and the broader point that time is cost. The author of this dissenting opinion has never seen his birth certificate and does not  know how he would go about ""scrounging"" it up. Nor does he enjoy waiting in line at  motor  vehicle  bureaus. <b>There is only one motivation for imposing burdens on voting that are ostensibly designed  to discourage voter impersonation fraud, if there is  no actual danger of such fraud, and that is to  discourage voting by persons likely to vote  against the party responsible for imposing the burdens.</b></p> \n</blockquote> \n<hr> \n<p><b>UPDATE:</b> This story was first posted before a federal appeals court ruled to let Texas use its voter ID law in the 2014 elections.

National Democrats are giving up on Alison Lundergan Grimes in Kentucky,http://www.vox.com/2014/10/14/6977287/democrats-abandon-alison-lundergan-grimes-kentucky,Picking and choosing their battles.,"<p>As we wrote <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/10/7/6938795/michigan-senate-terri-lynn-land"">last week</a>, this is the point in the midterms when each party has to take a hard look at its spending priorities, and redirect its money to the closest races.

So of course Ebola does, too.","<p><a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/ebola-facts-you-need-to-know/what-is-the-ebola-virus"" style=""line-height: 1.5;"">Ebola</a> seems about as far removed from partisan politics as you can imagine. It's a <a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/ebola-facts-you-need-to-know/what-it-feels-like-to-have-ebola-virus-outbreak"">horrifying</a> and <a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/ebola-facts-you-need-to-know/the-epidemic-spurred-ebola-treatment-development"">incurable</a> disease that has <a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/ebola-facts-you-need-to-know/texas-hospital-diagnoses-the-first-case-of-ebola-in-the-us"">reached the United States for the first time</a>. People are, naturally, alarmed. But there's no real pro or con argument to be had about Ebola, and Ebola has nothing to do with the main fault lines in American politics.</p> \n<p>Nonetheless, we already have conservative pundit Jonathan Last <a href=""http://jonathanlast.com/captain-ebs/"">speculating</a> that the US government response is being driven by President Obama's alleged commitment to open borders ideology, while Ross Douthat plays sensible conservative by <a href=""http://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/10/15/the-politics-of-ebola/"">knocking this down</a>.

Looking at Woodrow Wilson's 1916 re-election bid, Bartels and Achen show that Wilson's vote fell by about 10 percentage point in shark-afflicted communities relative to where it otherwise would have been. This is a huge impact — it's larger, for instance, than the gap between Michael Dukakis' performance in 1988 and Obama's landslide win twenty years later.</p> \n<p>Andrew Healy, Neil Malhorta, and Cecilia Hyunjung Mo showed in a 2010 paper that <a href=""http://www.pnas.org/content/107/29/12804.short"">college football performance</a> also affects voting behavior. Specifically, a win by the local team ""causes the incumbent to receive an additional 1.61 percentage points of the vote in Senate, gubernatorial, and presidential elections."" And the magnitude of the effect gets larger magnitude as the local team gets more popular — suggesting the result is unlikely to be mere coincidence. They also discovered that unexpected wins in the 2009 NCAA basketball tournament were associated with localized upsurges in presidential approval.</p> \n<p>It's not just that <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/4/6/5556462/brain-dead-how-politics-makes-us-stupid"">politics makes us stupid</a>.

Hemorrhagic fevers may have nothing to do with American politics as conventionally construed, but unlike college football games, they do have a clear relationship to the legitimate functions of government.</p> \n<p>Ebola is just political enough to serve as a perfect storm of derp — it is frightening and it is bad and it is souring views of the incumbent and people who want to use it to justify their ideological preconceptions will find a way. Brendan Nyhan notes that while Republicans are much more skeptical than Democrats that the federal government is adequately prepared for Ebola, the <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/17/upshot/the-partisan-divide-on-ebola-preparedness.html"">partisan valence was reversed</a> back in 2006 when George W Bush was in office.</p> \n<p>Last doesn't like Obama and he doesn't like Ebola, so he's decided — <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/10/13/6964633/travel-ban-airport-screening-ebola-outbreak-virus"">contrary to evidence and expert opinion</a> — that travel bans would be a good idea. And since Last doesn't like Obama's immigration policy, he's decided that Obama's opposition to a travel ban stems from his misguided ideas about immigration. Had Obama implemented a travel ban, Last would still dislike Obama and perhaps slam the president for ignoring expert advice.</p> \n<p>Were a Republican in the White House, liberals would be slamming <i>him</i> for the lack of a travel ban. Why can't president Romney see the obvious? Is he that in hock to free trade ideology? So deeply wedded to the financial interests of the airline industry? Something about oil? (It's always really about oil). In the real world, not everything is about politics. But in our minds, it is — whether it's a virus or a shark attack or a March Madness upset.</p>",Politics

Vox has produced many, many articles on both subjects. The point is that it is possible to cover these stories in a way that acknowledges their danger without over-hyping it, but that American media coverage is needlessly exaggerating the threats in a way that isn't just scaring people, but could well push American public opinion in a counterproductive direction.</p> \n<blockquote lang=""en"" class=""twitter-tweet""> \n<p>Woman spotted wearing full hazmat suit in Washington’s Dulles Airport: <a href=""http://t.co/9oOUg0BgRw"">http://t.co/9oOUg0BgRw</a> <a href=""http://t.co/bzL1IQXYqq"">pic.twitter.com/bzL1IQXYqq</a></p> \n— SICK CHIRPSE (@SickChirpse) <a href=""https://twitter.com/SickChirpse/status/523082441792425984"">October 17, 2014</a>\n</blockquote> \n<p>It's not just this one poll. <span>CNN's Ashleigh Banfield </span><a style=""font-size: 15.5555562973022px; line-height: 1.5;"" href=""http://thinkprogress.org/health/2014/10/07/3576799/ebola-cable-news-coverage/"">said</a> recently,<span> ""All ISIS would need to do is send a few of its suicide killers to Ebola affected zones and then get them on some mass transit, somewhere where they would need to be to affect the most damage.""</span><span> Yep — Ebola-infected ISIS suicide bombers.

On ISIS, it's making Americans much more hawkish. A Gallup poll found that three-quarters of Americans are following the ISIS story closely. Those Americans are <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/10/1/6869589/isis-terrorism-us-homeland"">substantially more likely</a> to be favor military action against ISIS — perhaps including the use US ground troops — presumably because they see it as a major threat.</p> \n<p>On Ebola, for example, Fox News has <a href=""http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2014/10/16/debate-grows-in-washington-over-ebola-travel-ban/"">repeatedly</a> <a href=""http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2014/10/15/carlson-it-is-crazy-that-obama-wont-impose-travel-ban-to-fight-ebola/"">pushed</a> the idea of a <a href=""http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2014/10/15/megyn-kelly-repeatedly-presses-cdc-director-in-firm-interview-over-ebola-why-not-put-a-travel-ban-in-place/"">travel ban</a> on people from ebola-stricken countries — a call that some members of Congress have since taken up. That wouldn't actually limit the disease's spread and <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/10/13/6964633/travel-ban-airport-screening-ebola-outbreak-virus"">would do serious harm</a> to the economies of Ebola-affected countries.</p> \n<p><q class=""right"" aria-hidden=""true"">there's a clear tradeoff between what sells and telling the truth</q></p> \n<p>Again, this is not to deny that Ebola and ISIS pose real dangers that are worth covering. But it's not just a question of tone around describing the threats; the media often tells only one half of the story, downplaying or ignoring the reasons <i>not</i> to panic, such as US defense systems — a crucial part of the ISIS and Ebola stories that many Americans simply aren't getting.</p> \n<p>In a country like the United States with a robust public health system, for example, the risk of Ebola spreading rapidly is vanishingly small.

Still, they also have a longer-term incentive to ingrain trust in their audience, and that means upholding basic responsibilities to tell the full story. It's not just the right thing to do — a better informed public is in everyone's interests.</span></p>",Politics

One reason why, Nate Cohn </span><a href=""http://www.newrepublic.com/blog/electionate/110297/democrats-keep-your-eyes-texas"">argued</a><span>, </span><span>is that ""White Texans keep getting more Republican."" </span><span>Another reason is that Hispanics make up a far lower percentage of the state's electorate than its population — only 22 percent in 2012, according to a </span><a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.latinodecisions.com/files/5413/9488/2480/Texas_AV_Report.pdf"">report</a><span> </span><span>by Latino Decisions.

Unlike in Kansas, where the GOP has <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/7/15/5901999/sam-brownback-moderate-republicans-endorse-paul-davis"">fractured ideologically</a>, Texas Republicans have tended to unite around conservative candidates who oust moderates in primaries. <span>What's more, Texas' budget situation is basically the opposite of <a href=""http://%20http://www.vox.com/2014/7/8/5868717/sam-brownback-kansas-tax-cut"">beleaguered Kansas</a>'. ""The big issue in 2015 is going to be what to do with the gargantuan surplus the state has,"" Jones says. Additionally, outgoing Republican Governor Rick Perry <a href=""http://trailblazersblog.dallasnews.com/2014/10/rick-perrys-approval-ratings-unchanged-in-texas-following-indictment-but-voters-split-over-whether-hes-innocent-or-guilty.html/"">remains popular</a> despite his <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/8/20/6046777/hardly-anyone-thinks-the-indictment-of-rick-perry-is-a-good-idea"">indictment</a>, so there's little sense among Texas voters that they need a major change — particularly in a year that looks to go poorly for Democrats nationally.</span>\n</div> \n<div><br></div> \n<div>\n<span>Overall, the conditions that would enable a major upheaval of the state's politics don't exist now. </span><span>""While Texas may eventually turn blue, it was never going to turn blue this election cycle barring some cataclysmic gaffe by Greg Abbott,"" Jones says.</span><span> </span><span>Henson concurs:</span><span> </span><span>""The story of the campaign has always been, 'Would Wendy Davis's really rapid ascension be the</span><span> </span><i style=""line-height: 1.5;"">beginning</i><span> </span><span>of a successful effort to reverse what have been deep structural trends in Texas?'""</span>\n</div> \n<h3><span>Davis isn't losing because of her personal traits or a bad campaign</span></h3> \n<div align=""center""> \n<div>\n<img src=""http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2382442/171540335.0.jpg"" alt=""Wendy Davis, after her filibuster, in June 2013"" data-chorus-asset-id=""2382442""> \n<p class=""caption"">Wendy Davis after her filibuster, June 2013.

Are mass shootings really on the rise? It depends how you count.,http://www.vox.com/2014/10/21/7027395/gun-violence-mass-shootings-james-alan-fox-mother-jones-cohen-azrael-suicide,"And either way, they're a small part of America's gun violence problem.","<p>Northeastern criminologist James Alan Fox claims that <a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/gun-violence-facts/mass-shootings-rare-united-states"">mass shootings aren't increasing</a>in the US. Researchers Amy P. Cohen, Deborah Azrael, and Matthew Miller of the Harvard School of Public Health argue <a href=""http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2014/10/mass-shootings-increasing-harvard-research"">they are, in fact, increasing</a>. Both are correct.</p> \n<p>Sometimes, in policy debates, there are strong disagreements about actual facts about the topic at hand. A defining feature of the climate change debate is that roughly half of the American political spectrum <a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/global-warming/what-is-climate-skepticism"">refuses to concede that climate change is even happening</a>. In those cases either one side is simply wrong (as in the climate change example), or else the issue is extremely hard to study and reach definite conclusions about. But much more common than straight-up factual disputes are disputes over interpretation. That's what's happening with Fox and the Harvard researchers.</p> \n<p>Fox uses a <a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/gun-violence-facts/mass-shootings-rare-united-states"">pretty straightforward definition of ""mass shooting""</a>: shootings in which at least four people die. And by that definition, he's right: shootings of four or more people haven't been on a clear upswing. They haven't been on a clear downswing either, which one might have expected in light of the <a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/gun-violence-facts/gun-homicide-decline-crime-drop"">overall decline in gun violence over the past twenty years</a>; while the rate is highly variable, the trend line has stayed roughly flat in recent decades:</p> \n<center> \n<p><img src=""http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/680662/Mass_20Shootings_201980-2010-thumb-533x320-79419.0.jpg"" alt=""no mass shooting increase"" data-chorus-asset-id=""680662""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">(<a href=""http://www.boston.com/community/blogs/crime_punishment/2012/08/no_increase_in_mass_shootings.html"">James Allan Fox</a>)</p> \n</center> \n<p>Cohen et al argue that <a href=""http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2014/10/mass-shootings-increasing-harvard-research"">that definition is too simple</a>. ""[Fox's] analysis,"" they write, ""which counts the number of events per year, lumps together mass shootings in public places with a far more numerous set of mass murders that are contextually distinct — a majority of which stem from domestic violence and occur in private homes."" It's true — most mass shootings are committed in a context of domestic or gang violence, and so those make up most of Fox's dataset.</p> \n<p>But Cohen et al want to restrict the definition further. They use <a href=""http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/09/mass-shootings-investigation"">data compiled by Mother Jones</a> on mass shootings, which ""exclude[s] mass killings in private homes related to domestic violence as well as attacks stemming from drug and gang-related activity."" Once they've zeroed on non-domestic/gang/drug violence mass shootings, Cohen et al then measure the average period of time between mass shooting incidents, rather than the number of incidents themselves; mass shootings of the kind they're studying are rare enough to make the latter untenable. They find that the period of time separating mass shootings (by their definition) has been shrinking:</p> \n<center> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""2375294"" alt=""mother jones mass shootings"" src=""http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2375294/shootingsSince2011.0.png""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">(<a href=""http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2014/10/mass-shootings-increasing-harvard-research"">Amy P. Cohen, Deborah Azrael, Matthew Miller / Mother Jones</a>)</p> \n</center> \n<h3>Does it matter what definition we use?</h3> \n<p>So who's right? Well, Fox is right about the phenomena he's studying, and Cohen et al are right about the phenomenon they're studying. Declaring one or the other definition the ""right"" one is too pat; each is right for the thing it's right for. Fox's data tells us that shootings of four or more people didn't decline in the 1990s the way shootings as a whole did; that's concerning. Cohen et al's data tells us that high profile public mass shootings like Aurora or Newtown have not only failed to decline the way normal shootings have, but have increased in recent years; that's also concerning.</p> \n<p>But people still care about determining the ""right"" definition in cases like this for the purpose of ideological proxy warfare. Declaring Fox or Cohen et al right has a certain political valence in the wider gun control debate. You see something similar in discussions around school shootings, wherein gun control skeptics are as eager to declare that <a href=""http://mediamatters.org/blog/2014/06/12/cnn-adopts-flawed-right-wing-logic-on-school-sh/199699"">gang-related shootings in school are not <i>real</i> school shootings</a> as they are to embrace Fox's definition in which gang-related mass shootings <i>are</i> real mass shootings — and vice versa for gun control supporters.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""center"">the best case for gun control has little to do with mass shootings, and isn't necessarily focused on homicides at all</q></p> \n<p>What's frustrating about this is that whether or not mass shootings are increasing or decreasing in frequency has very little to do with the generalized case for gun control. Mother Jones' Mark Follman — who has done extraordinary work on gun violence in America, including compiling the dataset used by Cohen et al — is not wrong when he <a style=""line-height: 1.5; background-color: #ffffff;"" href=""http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2014/10/mass-shootings-rising-harvard"">writes</a>, ""The question of whether public mass shootings can be prevented hinges on understanding the complex factors behind them."" And it's worth studying both the phenomena identified by Fox and that identified by Cohen et al to find specialized ways to prevent them. But mass shootings are very rare. By Fox's definition, there are between 50 and 125 victims a year (compared to <a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr63/nvsr63_03.pdf"">11,068 total gun homicides</a> in 2011); by the Mother Jones definition, there are substantially fewer than that.</p> \n<h3>The real case for gun control</h3> \n<p><img src=""http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/assets/4523969/US_gun_homicide_suicide_rate__1999_to_2010.png"" alt=""gun homicide suicide rate"" data-chorus-asset-id=""642232""></p> \n<p>Mass shootings can and should be prevented, and their comparative rarity makes them no less monstrous or tragic. But the best case for gun control has little to do with mass shootings, and isn't necessarily focused on homicides at all. <a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/gun-violence-facts/gun-suicide-homicide-common"">19,990 of the 32,351 firearm deaths (61.8 percent)</a> in 2011 were suicides. The evidence that <a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/gun-violence-facts/gun-homicide-effect-increase"">the presence of additional guns contributes to more firearm homicides</a> is persuasive, but research from the <a href=""http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/means-matter/means-matter/risk/"">Means Matter Project</a> at the Harvard School of Public Health (much of it done by Azrael and Miller themselves, along with Cathy Barber) shows that <a style=""line-height: 1.5;"" href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/gun-violence-facts/gun-suicide-attempt-control"">the evidence guns contribute to higher levels of suicide</a> is considerably stronger.</p> \n<p>Suicide, contrary to popular belief, isn't typically planned and thought through extensively in advance. It's impulsive; one survey found that <a href=""http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/means-matter/means-matter/impulsivity/"">90 percent of respondents deliberated for less than a day</a> before attempting suicide. And 90 percent of people who survive suicide attempts <a href=""http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/means-matter/means-matter/survival/"">end up dying by other means</a>. They didn't make a considered choice and seek to follow through by whatever means; they made an impulsive decision and got lucky. Ken Baldwin, who survived a jump off the Golden Gate Bridge, once <a href=""http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2003/10/13/031013fa_fact?currentPage=all"">told</a> the New Yorker's Tad Friend that as he was falling, he ""instantly realized that everything in my life that I’d thought was unfixable was totally fixable — except for having just jumped.""</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""center"">America's gun homicide problem is real, frightening, and must be addressed. But its gun suicide problem is considerably worse.</q></p> \n<p>Guns make it likelier that these impulsive decisions end in death rather than survival and recovery. <a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/ss5307a1.htm"" target=""_blank"" style=""line-height: 26.25px; background-color: #ffffff;"">Studies</a><span> </span><a href=""http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/means-matter/means-matter/case-fatality/"" target=""_blank"" style=""line-height: 26.25px; background-color: #ffffff;"">suggest</a><span> that suicide attempts using guns </span><a href=""http://jech.bmj.com/content/57/2/120.full"" target=""_blank"" style=""line-height: 26.25px; background-color: #ffffff;"">are fatal in the vast majority of cases</a><span>, while attempts using cuts or poisoning are only fatal 6-7 percent of the time. So it's perhaps unsurprising that </span><a href=""http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/means-matter/means-matter/risk/"">areas with more guns </a>tend to have<a href=""http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/means-matter/means-matter/risk/""> </a><a href=""http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/crime/2013/12/gun_ownership_causes_higher_suicide_rates_study_shows.html"">higher suicide rates</a><span>, or that </span><a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/gun-violence-facts/gun-suicide-attempt-control"">a number of gun control measures have been successful in preventing suicides</a><span>. In one particularly dramatic case, </span><span>the Israeli Defense Forces stopped letting soldiers bring their guns home over the weekend, and </span><a href=""http://www.gsoa.ch/media/medialibrary/2010/12/Lubin_10.pdf"">suicides fell 40 percent</a><span>, primarily due to a drop in firearm suicides committed on weekends.</span></p> \n<p>The dominant focus of gun control efforts, then should be on keeping guns (and particularly handguns) out of the hands of suicidal people. America's gun homicide problem is real, frightening, and must be addressed. But its gun suicide problem is considerably worse.

There are basically no swing voters in this year's elections,http://www.vox.com/2014/10/21/7027719/swing-voters-independents-2014-midterm-elections-polarized-republican-advantage,A new study on who's voting in 2014 has bad news for red-state Dems,"<p>Voters in midterm elections are different from voters in presidential elections: not only do fewer people turn out to vote when there isn't a presidential race on the ballot, but the people who <i>do </i>turn out to vote every two years are older and whiter than the presidential electorate. Vox's Ezra Klein explained this phenomenon — and why it helps Republicans — in our midterm election preview video:</p> \n<p><!-- CHORUS_VIDEO_EMBED ChorusVideo:57244 --></p> \n<p>But there's another important difference between the electorate in midterms and the electorate in presidential years. The people who care enough to turn out for a midterm election are more likely to be committed to a particular political ideology, and to the party that shares it. They think it's really important for the country that their side win — and the other side lose. That means that there are fewer swing voters turning out than in presidential years.</p> \n<p>A <a href=""http://www.people-press.org/2014/10/17/political-polarization-in-action-insights-into-the-2014-election-from-the-american-trends-panel/"" target=""_blank"">study from the Pew Research Center</a> shows that this is as true as ever in 2014. People who are solidly liberal or conservative are more likely to vote than people who are moderate, or not as ideologically committed. And because of that, the midterm electorate in 2014 overrepresents the ends of the ideological spectrum, and underrepresents the middle:</p> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""2375466"" alt=""Pew Research Center chart likely voters polarized"" src=""http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2375466/10-17-2014-1.0.png""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">(Pew Center for the People and the Press)</p> \n<h3>Voters aren't interested in crossing party lines</h3> \n<p>This means a couple of things for the candidates in next month's elections. For one thing, as much as some candidates in tough races (particularly Democrats) have tried to run away from their parties, most of the people who show up to vote in November will be voting for the party, not the candidate. Only ten percent of likely 2014 voters plan to ""split their ticket"" between parties — the rest are planning to vote down the ticket for Democrats, or for Republicans.</p> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""2375546"" alt=""Pew research center ticket splitting LVs vs RVs "" src=""http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2375546/10-17-2014-5.0.png""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">(Pew Center for the People and the Press)</p> \n<p class=""caption""> </p> \n<p>The above chart also shows how the ideological skew and the demographic skew of the midterms affect each other. Even though, generally, partisans are more likely to vote than non-partisans, straight-ticket Democratic voters (likely to be young or nonwhite) are actually slightly <i>underrepresented </i>among likely 2014 voters compared to all voters. Meanwhile, older, whiter Republican partisans are a lot more numerous than partisan Democrats among the people likely to vote in November despite <span>making up a smaller share of registered voters</span><span>.</span></p> \n<h3>No true independents</h3> \n<p>And if candidates are hoping to escape the partisan determinism of straight-ticket voting by targeting independents, they're setting themselves up for disappointment. The Pew survey reinforces something <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Myth-Independent-Voter-Bruce-Keith/dp/0520077202"">political scientists have known for years</a>: even people who call themselves ""independents"" are more likely than not to vote straight down the ticket for one major party or the other. Among all voters, about a third of so-called ""independents"" are straight-ticket Republican voters, and a quarter are straight-ticket Democrats:</p> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""2375636"" alt=""Pew Research Center no true independents"" src=""http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2375636/10-17-2014-6.0.png""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">(Pew Center for the People and the Press)</p> \n<p>And that's among all registered independents — not just the ones who care enough to turn out in 2014. Those independents, like all midterm voters, are more likely to be consistently liberal or conservative — meaning they're more likely to be straight-ticket partisan voters than genuinely independent ones.</p>",Politics
How car dealers' war on Tesla harms consumers,http://www.vox.com/xpress/2014/10/22/7033071/Tesla-michigan-direct-sales-ban,"At the behest of the car dealers' lobby, Michigan just passed legislation preserving the state's ban on direct sales of automobiles.","<p>A number of states have laws prohibiting car manufacturers from selling cars directly to consumers. They require, instead, that they purchase new cars from dealerships. Tesla has been seeking permission to sell its innovative electric cars directly to consumers across the country. But the company experienced a setback on Tuesday, as Michigan governor Rick Snyder <a href=""http://www.michigan.gov/snyder/0,4668,7-277-57577_57657-339774--,00.html"">signed legislation</a> strengthening the state's ban on direct car sales.</p> \n<p>It's hard to see how these laws could be anything but bad news for Michigan consumers. Like any middleman, dealers drive up the cost of cars, and these laws prevent Tesla from developing more convenient ways to deliver cars to consumers. <span>Tellingly, in his </span><a href=""http://www.michigan.gov/snyder/0,4668,7-277-57577_57657-339774--,00.html"" style=""line-height: 1.5; background-color: #ffffff;"">post</a><span> explaining his support for the legislation, Snyder doesn't actually make the case in favor of the ban. He just points out that direct sales were already illegal and the new legislation just makes modest changes to the existing rules.</span></p> \n<p>The main supporters of these laws are auto dealerships themselves. <a href=""http://online.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887324049504578541902814606098"">According to the Wall Street Journal</a>, ""dealers say laws passed over the decades to prevent car makers from selling directly to consumers are justified because without them auto makers could use their economic clout to sell vehicles for less than their independent franchisees."" This argument doesn't make much sense. Lower prices might be bad news for independent franchisees, but they're a good thing from the consumer's perspective.</p> \n<p>But despite their weak policy arguments, auto dealerships have a lot of clout with state legislators. People who own auto dealerships tend to be pretty affluent, so they can afford to make generous campaign contributions. And dealerships are spread out around a state, allowing dealers' groups to organize a potent state-wide lobbying campaign. The result: the Michigan legislature overwhelmingly approved the protectionist legislation.</p> \n<p><span>As economists at the Federal Trade Commission have </span><a style=""line-height: 1.5; background-color: #ffffff;"" href=""http://www.ftc.gov/news-events/blogs/competition-matters/2014/04/who-decides-how-consumers-should-shop"">written</a><span>, the ban on direct auto sales is ""an anomaly in the broader economy, where most manufacturers compete to respond to consumer needs by choosing from among direct sales to consumers, reliance on independent dealers, or some combination of the two.""

That decision — though it was technically a choice <i>not</i> to weigh in on the issue — altered this modern civil rights battle so dramatically that even longtime LGBT rights advocates say they couldn't have predicted it</p> \n<p>""I'm blown away by this,"" said James Esseks, a lawyer who heads the American Civil Liberties Union's legal efforts concerning LGBT rights, in an interview with the <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/courts_law/supreme-court-declines-to-review-same-sex-marriage-cases/2014/10/06/ee822848-4d5e-11e4-babe-e91da079cb8a_story.html)"">Washington Post.</a></p> \n<p>And why wouldn't he be?

Texas</i>, when states were putting people in jail for same sex. At the time we didn't have any impression that we'd be this far along in 11 years,"" Paul Smith, a partner at the Washington, D.C. law firm Jenner &amp; Block, told Vox. Even as recently as five years ago, he said, ""It was hard to see it moving this quickly.""</p> \n<h3>Marriage equality is the new normal</h3> \n<p>The Supreme Court, by refusing to hear appeals against pro-gay marriage decisions in Indiana, Oklahoma, Utah, Virginia, and Wisconsin, effectively legalized gay marriage in those states. But because the judicial circuits in question also covered Colorado, North Carolina, South Carolina, Kansas, West Virginia, and Wyoming, those states will also have to abide by the ruling.</p> \n<p>Those 11 states join California, Connecticut, DC, Delaware,  Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington, which have already legalized gay marriage.</p> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""2384558"" alt=""same-sex_marriage_US.0.0.png"" src=""http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2384558/same-sex_marriage_US.0.0.png""></p> \n<p>According to calculations by the University of California, Los Angeles School of Law's <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/07/us/denying-review-justices-clear-way-for-gay-marriage-in-5-states.html?_r=0"">Williams Institute</a> think tank, that means that nearly two-thirds of same-sex couples in the United States will soon live in states where they can tie the knot.</p> \n<p>And just 14 days after this major legal development, there was more: On October 20, President Obama <a href=""http://www.vox.com/xpress/2014/10/20/7015673/president-obama-now-says-the-constitution-protects-same-sex-marriage"">declared</a> more decisively than ever before that he believes the Constitution protects marriage between two men or two women.</p> \n<p>That's quite the shift from when, <a href=""http://online.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304070304577394332545729926"">as a candidate</a>, he opposed same-sex marriage, only going as far as to support civil unions (and later ""<a target=""_blank"" href=""http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2012/05/timeline-of-obamas-evolving-on-same-sex-marriage/"">evolved</a>"" to believe ""same-sex couples should be able to get married."")

""As last year's disastrous crusade for gay marriage illustrated, Democrats cannot allow their constituencies to draw them into political terrain that can't be defended at election time,"" Paul Starr wrote.</p> \n<p>In 1996, when Barack Obama was running for State Senate in Illinois, he <a href=""http://www.windycitymediagroup.com/images/publications/wct/2009-01-14/current.pdf"">told</a> a local gay newspaper that he supported same-sex marriage. ""I favor legalizing same-sex marriages, and would fight efforts to prohibit such marriages,"" he wrote. But by 2008, he had gotten with the political program. ""I believe marriage is between a man and a woman,"" he told MTV. ""I am not in favor of gay marriage.""</p> \n<p>What's striking about Obama's latest ""evolution,"" paired with the Supreme Court decisions, is how little political controversy they've created. National Republicans haven't condemned the decision as ""judicial activism."" The GOP's 2016 hopefuls haven't lined up to blast Obama's statement as another example of liberals trying to legislate from the bench.</p> \n<p>""It's interesting, in the states where the decisions started to go into effect in the past few weeks, you haven't seen any great backlash. Everyone's just like, ‘okay' ... "" said <a href=""http://jenner.com/people/PaulSmith"">Smith</a>.</p> \n<p>Let it sink in: that's an ""okay"" to the fact that legal same-sex marriage will be the norm in America — so much so that there's apparently an open spot for the issue that will be designated the ""<a href=""file://localhost/-%09http/::www.slate.com:articles:news_and_politics:politics:2014:10:same_sex_marriage_now_that_the_battle_over_marriage_equality_is_ending_what.html"">next big culture war</a>.""

That's because, while there could be a future Supreme Court ruling on the underlying Constitutional question that Obama weighed in on, we now have a big clue about the justices' state of mind on this issue, and so do courts throughout the country.</p> \n<p>""[The Court's recent action] supports the prevailing assumption that a majority of justices support a right to same sex marriage, and it will mean that lower courts are more likely to rule in the same way,"" said Smith.</p> \n<p>And if, by chance, an appeals court does rule that state prohibitions against same-sex marriage are allowed under the Constitution, ""the Court will clearly take the case and decide the issue,"" Esseks told the <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/courts_law/supreme-court-declines-to-review-same-sex-marriage-cases/2014/10/06/ee822848-4d5e-11e4-babe-e91da079cb8a_story.html"">Washington Post</a>.

(Currently, a libertarian candidate is polling in the low single-digits). That might mean Democrats will have an even tougher time of turning out their voters. It also means that if control of the Senate hangs in the balance, the race would be nationalized — and Georgia's conservative-leaning electorate would be repeatedly informed that if they vote for Nunn, they'd be ensuring that Harry Reid would remain Senate Majority Leader. Nunn's best hope then might actually be for Democrats to lose the Senate decisively on election day, so she can continue framing the race as herself versus Perdue, rather than Reid versus McConnell.</p> \n<div align=""center""> \n<p><a href=""http://www.vox.com/a/election-2014-forecast""><chorus-asset class=""chorus-snippet browser_wide_media"" data-id=""815890""> <img alt=""Battle for Congress"" class=""small"" src=""http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/815890/BattleforCongress-inArticle-Door.0.png""></chorus-asset></a></p> \n</div>",Politics

6 reasons Elizabeth Warren should run forÂ president,http://www.vox.com/2014/10/24/7052737/elizabeth-warren-should-run-for-president,Of course Elizabeth Warren should run for president. Here's why.,"<p>Is Elizabeth Warren running for president? Maybe!</p> \n<p>In the past, when asked if she's running for president, Warren has been pretty clear: ""I am not running for president,"" she <a href=""http://www.bostonglobe.com/news/nation/2014/06/29/elizabeth-warren-testing-populist-message-south-bid-help-democrats-hold-senate/RyDRHNg5KP0eovHcOyqYXJ/story.html"" target=""_blank"">said</a> in June of 2014. ""Do you want to put an exclamation point at the end of that?""</p> \n<p>But in a recent interview with <a href=""http://www.people.com/article/elizabeth-warren-interview-youtube-treasury-secretary-hillary-clinton"" target=""_blank"">People</a><i>, </i>Warren was rather less emphatic. ""I don't think so,"" she replied, before saying: ""If there's any lesson I've learned in the last five years, it's don't be so sure about what lies ahead. There are amazing doors that could open.""</p> \n<p>Warren's office, of course, <a href=""http://www.thenation.com/blog/184657/did-elizabeth-warren-just-change-her-tune-running-president#"" target=""_blank"">insists</a> ""nothing has changed.""</p> \n<p>The truth is that at this point, Elizabeth Warren has no idea whether she'll run for president. The election is too far away, and too much could change, and she doesn't need to make a decision yet.<span> </span></p> \n<p><span>The more interesting question is the one she's probably asking herself: should Elizabeth Warren run for president? </span><span>Luckily, the answer to that is easy, and obvious: of course she should. There are six reasons why.</span></p> \n<h3>1) She can</h3> \n<p><b></b><span>In 2012, 416 people </span><a href=""http://www.fec.gov/press/press2011/presidential_form2nm.shtml"" target=""_blank"">registered</a><span> as presidential candidates with the Federal Election Commission. But you probably haven't heard of most of them. Being taken seriously as a presidential candidate requires a rare mixture of money, supporters, staff, volunteers, poll numbers, luck, elite credibility and more. Warren has it. </span></p> \n<p><span>There are already Draft Warren campaigns </span><a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/she-the-people/wp/2014/07/22/can-this-woman-convince-elizabeth-warren-to-run-for-president/"" target=""_blank"">popping up</a><span> around the country. There are already willing donors. There's intense media interest. She would instantly be taken seriously as a presidential candidate. She would be in every debate. She would have press at every campaign stop. She would have volunteers in every state. Not many people get that opportunity. Warren should take her shot.</span></p> \n<h3>2) She has something to gain</h3> \n<p>The best argument against Elizabeth Warren running for president is that she'll almost certainly lose — at least as long as Hillary Clinton is also running. I agree with that. It's just not a very good argument against Warren running for president.</p> \n<p>There are a lot of reasons to run for president. One of them, of course, is that you just may win. But with the exception of the presidency itself,  there's no better platform for forcing your ideas to the top of the political agenda. This is true even if you lose.</p> \n<p><span>One of the ways that front-runners squash challengers is by co-opting their best ideas.</span><span> </span>Mitt Romney scrapped a perfectly sensible tax plan and replaced it with something much more mathematically inventive after Herman Cain got traction with his 9-9-9 pitch. Barack Obama brought out a serious health-reform bill and promised to make it a top priority in his first term after John Edwards and Hillary Clinton forced it to the front of the Democratic agenda.</p> \n<p>But once the idea is co-opted, it becomes a campaign promise — and presidential candidates hew much closer to their campaign promises than most people realize. There's a good argument that Obamacare only happened because Edwardscare was a threat during the Democratic primaries.</p> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""2387282"" alt=""Elizabeth Warren"" src=""http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2387282/475278947.0.jpg""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">SAUL LOEB/AFP/Getty Images</p> \n<h3>3) She has something to say</h3> \n<p><b></b>Elizabeth Warren is an unusual politician: she ended up in politics because she had big ideas that people really liked. That's a departure from most politicians, who basically don't have any original ideas at all, and who end up in politics because they badly want to be politicians.</p> \n<p>Warren made her name as a Harvard law professor who became something of a public intellectual. She was early in <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003PJ6UKC?btkr=1"" target=""_blank"">recognizing</a> how squeezed middle-class families had become, and in <a href=""http://www.democracyjournal.org/5/6528.php?page=all"" target=""_blank"">arguing</a> for a consumer financial protection bureau, and in making the case against the spiraling complexity of Wall Street.</p> \n<p>She's continued pushing some big thoughts in the Senate. She's been out front arguing for the reinstatement of Glass-Steagall, for instance. She's made <a href=""http://www.motherjones.com/mojo/2014/02/elizabeth-warren-judicial-nominations-brennan-center"" target=""_blank"">interesting points</a> about the pro-business drift of the federal judiciary. She's pushed hard on the idea that banks shouldn't become so big that they're effectively immune from criminal prosecution.</p> \n<p>She's in politics, in other words, because she cares about policy, and because she's got some big ideas for improving it. A presidential campaign is her best shot at making those ideas the Democratic Party's platform rather than just Elizabeth Warren's press releases.</p> \n<h3>4) What else is she going to be doing between 2015 and 2016?</h3> \n<p>If Warren were, say, the chair of the Senate Banking Committee, and if Democrats controlled the House and the Senate and the presidency, then there would be a good argument that Warren could do more as a legislator than as a candidate. But Warren is, in real life, the second-most junior senator on the Banking Committee. And she's likely to be serving in a Senate controlled by Republicans, at a time when the White House is controlled by a Democrat, and absolutely nothing is getting done.</p> \n<p>So it's not just that running for president could do an enormous amount to push Warren's issues forward. It's that hanging around the Senate isn't going to do anything for Warren's issues at all. It's hard to imagine two better years to spend away from the Senate than 2015 and 2016.</p> \n<h3>5) She might not get another chance</h3> \n<p>This is an argument Ryan Lizza made in December of 2005, in a <a href=""http://www.newrepublic.com/article/politics/run"" target=""_blank"">piece</a> arguing that Obama should do the then-unthinkable and run for president, so I'll just quote him:</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>The kind of political star power Obama has doesn't last. My favorite law of American politics is that candidates have only 14 years to become president [or vice president]. That is their expiration date … the majority of presidents since 1900 have fallen on the low end of this zero-to-fourteen-year spectrum: zero (Dwight Eisenhower, Herbert Hoover, William Howard Taft), two years (Woodrow Wilson, Theodore Roosevelt), four years (Franklin Roosevelt, Calvin Coolidge), and six years (George W. Bush, Jimmy Carter, Richard Nixon, Warren Harding). The lesson is that Obama must strike while he is hot or risk fading into obscurity.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>You can pretty much swap Warren's name in for Obama's throughout that whole section. If Warren doesn't run in 2016 and Hillary Clinton does run and wins, then it will be at least eight years until Warren can run again. By then, she will likely have lost all or most of her star power. Wall Street reform will probably have faded as an issue. And she'll be 75 years old. Warren will have missed her moment.</p> \n<h3>6) And if she loses? ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯</h3> \n<p> </p> \n<p>Warren isn't up for reelection in 2016, so there's no particular conflict between keeping her seat and running for president. And if she loses, there's no particular reason to think she won't join the illustrious ranks of senators who ran for president, fell a bit short, and then became <i>even more important</i> senators. That list includes Democrats like Ted Kennedy, Joe Biden, and John Kerry, as well as Republicans like John McCain, Bob Dole, and Richard Lugar. Senators don't get penalized for running for president and losing.</p> \n<p>Which is all to say that the question isn't, ""Why should Elizabeth Warren run for president?"" It's, ""Why shouldn't she?""</p> \n<p> </p> \n<p><b>Correction: </b>This piece initially used Sen. Lamar Alexander as one of the examples of US senators who ran for president, lost, and then became a yet more important member of the Senate. Alexander actually ran for president after being governor of Tennessee, but before being elected to the Senate. The text has been updated.</p>",Politics
"Journalists don't like Obama's chill temperament, but it's served him well",http://www.vox.com/2014/10/24/7053903/josh-green-obama-crisis,Pundits are habitual over-reactors and so we like hot-head politicians. But Obama's style has served him well in his actual job.,"<p>January 20, 2010 was one of the very most memorable days of my eleven years in Washington. The previous evening Scott Brown had defeated Martha Coakley in a special election to fill the US Senate vacancy left by Ted Kennedy's death. Genuinely surprising electoral outcomes are rare, so it was natural that the political community was electrified by Brown's triumph. But to most observers the stunner also had a very concrete significance — the drive to pass an <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/obamacare/what-is-obamacare"">Obamacare</a> bill through the United States Congress was dead.</p> \n<p>Of course Republicans spun it that way. But many Democrats — including senior figures on and off Capitol Hill as well the President's own chief of staff — agreed as well.</p> \n<p>The message of the election was clear. Obamacare was finished. The only question was what, if anything, could be salvaged from the wreckage. At the Center for American Progress, where I was working at the time, the halls were buzzing with scenarios. Maybe a bill to cover all kids? Some kind of Medicaid expansion? Having come so far toward universal coverage, nobody wanted to give up. But the crisis clearly required some dramatic turnabout. Some grand gesture to make it clear that the President ""got it.""</p> \n<h3>A cool head in a crisis</h3> \n<div class=""align-right""> \n<p><img src=""http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2386790/bbw_obama_cool_102714.0.gif"" alt=""bbw_obama_cool_102714.0.gif"" data-chorus-asset-id=""2386790""></p> \n</div> \n<p>That's the day that came to mind as I was reading Josh Green's Businessweek story detailing <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2014-10-23/ebola-obamacare-syria-highlight-obamas-crisis-management"">Obama's alleged failings as a crisis manager</a>.</p> \n<p>From Deepwater Horizon to Ebola to ISIS, Green alleges, Obama's cool cerebral technocratic approach denies ""the public's emotional needs."" The president ""disdains the performative aspects of his job."" Consequently, he ""struggles to strike the right tone."" He is, in Green's view, a perpetual under-reactor who has ""an excess of faith in government's ability to solve problems.""</p> \n<p>So about Scott Brown.</p> \n<p>It turned out that a version of Obamacare had already passed the US Senate with a filibuster-proof 60-vote majority. If House Democrats were willing to abandon their own version of health reform and pass the Senate bill, then the Senate could use the budget reconciliation process to enact some limited changes. Nothing about Brown's victory changed the fundamental reality. Democrats could have Obamacare if they wanted it, and if they didn't pass the law it would be because they decided not to, not because Brown's victory forced them out of it.</p> \n<p>Nancy Pelosi was a strong advocate of this view, but it struck many party leaders as insane. Rep. Barney Frank, for instance, <a href=""http://spectator.org/blog/21575/barney-frank-deals-potential-death-blow-obamacare"" target=""_blank"">declared</a> Obamacare dead on the night of Brown's win. Ultimately, however, Obama became the hero of his own administration by coming down on her side. He refused to give into the panic gripping the Democrats and focused in on the math of the situation — and there, it turned out, Democrats had more than enough votes to pass the bill. As a response to the Brown win, it made no <i>emotional</i> sense. But it did make sense. And today Obamacare is law.</p> \n<h3>Choose your poison</h3> \n<p><img src=""http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2386794/457166034.0.0.jpg"" alt=""457166034.0.0.jpg"" data-chorus-asset-id=""2386794""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Remember this guy (Sean Gardner/Getty)</p> \n<p>There's no single optimal temperament for all times and all places. Obama, by temperament, is a cool cucumber. I am not. At times, Obama might have been better served by a more emotional approach and an itchier trigger finger. But Obama was right during the political crisis of January 2010.</p> \n<p>He was also right back in October of 2008 when the American banking sector seemed to be collapsing. It's easy now to forget those days, but George W. Bush, the actual president of the United States at the time, had all-but-disappeared from public view. Obama's opponent, John McCain, was never one to underreact. Most observers greatly appreciated the younger senator's ability to keep things in perspective and his evident dedication to trying to learn the relevant facts. It struck an appealing contrast with the erratic McCain and his <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.usnews.com/news/campaign-2008/articles/2008/09/24/mccain-suspends-campaign-shocks-republicans"">campaign suspensions</a>. Similarly, two months earlier, McCain was proclaiming <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iphxko1Amkk"">""we are all Georgians now""</a> in response to Putin's incursion into South Ossetia. A systematic overreactor would have had his finger much more on the public pulse when Ebola first arrived in Dallas. But he also might have embroiled the country in a nuclear war with Russia.</p> \n<p>Critics, including Green, like to satirize Obama's cool by comparing him to Spock. But Spock, though often played for laughs, was a damn fine officer. His clear thinking not only saved the Enterprise on countless occasions but was instrumental in brokering a historic peace accord between the Federation and the Klingon Empire.</p> \n<h3><span>A president, not a pundit</span></h3> \n<p><img src=""http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2386798/Ben-Huh-Obama.0.jpg"" alt=""Ben-Huh-Obama.0.jpg"" data-chorus-asset-id=""2386798""></p> \n<p>Journalists have systematic professional incentives to overreact. You don't get ahead by writing boring stories, so you develop a nose for the provocative and start dealing in superlatives. Yet few people can make it through life acting purely out of cynicism. It helps enormously in this profession to be a genuine temperamental over-reactor. Certainly it's helped me.</p> \n<p>The hot temperament consequently tends to dominate in the ranks of the media. And the media love nothing quite so much as a politician who shares their disposition. It's not a coincidence that McCain is, on a durable basis, the media's favorite senator.</p> \n<p>He approaches his job as if you gave a Senate vote to a cantankerous but sharp newspaper columnist. But that path was never available to a young African-American liberal from Chicago. The alternative to cool and cerebral was ""angry"" and radical, a non-starter with white America.</p> \n<p>But more than a political pose, an aversion to purely symbolic action has genuinely served Obama well at critical moments. Less cool heads would have abandoned Obamacare in January 2010. Obama persevered and it's worked. Obama's approach to the economy has been far from flawless, but it's not a coincidence that the USA has performed better since 2008 than Europe or the United Kingdom and weathered its financial crisis far better than Japan did in the 1990s.</p> \n<p>The Deepwater Horizon crisis passed. The American Ebola crisis will also pass. HealthCare.gov got fixed. The Russian economy is <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://finance.yahoo.com/news/russia-tones-down-rhetoric-economy-121500695.html"">reeling</a> in the face of sanctions. Osama bin Laden is dead. The economy is growing. Obama hasn't always been a very effective pundit-in-chief (acute crisis moments aside, his inability to articulate public anger at Wall Street has been remarkable) but that's not actually his job. On the big stuff, he's been effective. And that's not a coincidence.</p>",Politics
"The 1% are more likely to vote than the poor or the middle class, and it matters â€” a lot",http://www.vox.com/2014/10/24/7055091/class-and-turnout,The political system is systematically skewed by the class bias in voting behavior.,"<p>Does it matter that the wealthy turnout to vote at a rate of <a href=""http://www.demos.org/publication/why-voting-gap-matters"">almost</a> 99% while those making below $10,000 vote at a rate of 49%? It sure seems like it would, but for a long time many political scientists and journalists <a href=""http://www.demos.org/publication/why-voting-gap-matters"">believed it didn't</a>. In their seminal 1980 study on the question (using data from 1972) Raymond Wolfinger and Steven Rosenstone <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Who-Votes-Yale-Fastback-Series/dp/0300025521"">argued that</a>, ""voters are virtually a carbon copy of the citizen population."" In a 1999 study, Wolfinger and Benjamin  Highton find a slightly larger gap between voters and nonvoters, but still <a href=""http://escholarship.org/uc/item/4sf6c8cb#page-1"">conclude</a>, ""non-voters appear well represented by those who vote.""</p> \n<p>This argument has been largely assimilated by pundits and also non-voters, 59% of whom <a href=""http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/politics/story/2012-08-15/non-voters-obama-romney/57055184/1"">believe</a> ""nothing ever gets done,"" and 41% of whom say ""my vote doesn't make a difference anyway.""</p> \n<p>But <a href=""http://www.demos.org/publication/why-voting-gap-matters"" target=""_blank"">more recent research</a> suggests that the logic of wealth voters is sound — and that if the poor and middle class turned out at a higher rate, policy would shift leftward on economic policy. The most important <a href=""http://www.nyu.edu/gsas/dept/politics/faculty/nagler/leighley_nagler_midwest2007.pdf"">study</a> on the question is by Jan Leighley and Jonathan Nagler. They revisit the Wolfinger/Rosenstone thesis and find that, in fact, non-voters are not, ""a carbon copy"" of the voting electorate as previously assumed. They find that, ""notable demographic, economic, and political changes that have occurred in the U.S. since Wolfinger and Rosenstone's classic statement [their 1980 book, ""Who Votes""]."" The most important difference that Leighley and Nagler find is that:</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>After 1972, voters and non-voters differ significantly on most issues relating to the role of government in redistributive policies. In addition to these differences being evident in nearly every election since 1972, we also note that the nature of the electoral bias is clear as well: voters are substantially more conservative than non-voters on class-based issues.</p> \n<p><!--[if gte mso 9]><xml> 0   0   1   397   2266   Vox Media    18   5   2658   14.0 </xml><![endif]--> <!--[if gte mso 9]><xml> Normal   0               false   false   false      EN-US   JA   X-NONE </xml><![endif]--><!--[if gte mso 9]><xml> </xml><![endif]--> <!--[if gte mso 10]> \n<style> \n /* Style Definitions */ \ntable.MsoNormalTable \n\t{mso-style-name:""Table Normal""; \n\tmso-tstyle-rowband-size:0; \n\tmso-tstyle-colband-size:0; \n\tmso-style-noshow:yes; \n\tmso-style-priority:99; \n\tmso-style-parent:""""; \n\tmso-padding-alt:0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt; \n\tmso-para-margin:0in; \n\tmso-para-margin-bottom:.0001pt; \n\tline-height:115%; \n\tmso-pagination:widow-orphan; \n\tfont-size:11.0pt; \n\tmso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt; \n\tfont-family:Arial; \n\tcolor:black;} \n</style> \n<![endif]--></p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>That is, after the New Deal consensus eroded, policy views became more polarized along class lines and the class-skewed nature of the electorate began to matter considerably.

They find no instances in which low-income voter turnout was higher than high-income voter turnout. Across midterm and presidential elections, Census data show strong gaps between turnout rates between those earning above $150k and those earning less than $10k (a 32.6 point gap in 2008, a 34.9 point gap in 2010).</p> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""2386826"" alt=""Screen_Shot_2014-10-23_at_8.23.36_PM.0.png"" src=""http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2386826/Screen_Shot_2014-10-23_at_8.23.36_PM.0.png""></p> \n<p>There is evidence that this affects the political system. Consider a recent <a href=""http://www.vanderbilt.edu/csdi/miller-stokes/08_MillerStokes_BroockmanSkovron.pdf"">study</a> by David Broockman and Christopher Skovron finds that politicians believe that their constituencies are significantly more conservative than they are. Such a bias should be impossible to sustain - politicians have strong electoral incentives to gauge their constitutents' views correctly. Once we understand that voters are more conservative than non-voters, the puzzle disappears. Politicians's real constituents are the people who vote — a disproportionately affluent and conservative slice of the population.</p> \n<p>Conversely, where the electorate is less skewed policy outcomes shift left. In a recent study William Franko, Nathan J. Kelly and Christopher Witko <a href=""http://www.scholarsstrategynetwork.org/sites/default/files/ssn_key_findings_franco_kelly_and_witko_on_class_bias_in_voter_turnout.pdf"">find</a> that ""where the poor exercise their voice more in the voting booth relative to higher income groups, inequality is lower.""

He finds that states with smaller voting gaps across incomes had policies more favorable to the poor.

4 ways millennials are changingÂ politics,http://www.vox.com/2014/10/27/7072683/millennials-civic-engagement,There's more to political engagement than voting.,"<p><span>Remember 2008 -the year young people shocked American historians by showing up to vote? That cycle may seem anomalous now, as voter turnout rates have dropped, and many of those same voters claim today to be disappointed by government. But voting rates don't tell the full story. Young voters still believe public officials can drive change; but some believe the ballot box isn't the only way to influence them. In this case, Millennials aren't waiting for policymakers to legislate.</span></p> \n<p><span>Here are four ways they're redefining political life in 2014.</span></p> \n<h3>1) They actually care about the issues</h3> \n<p>This generation isn't as politically disaffected and apathetic as generations past. In the 2012 presidential election, 18 to 29 year olds made up over 21 percent of the eligible voting population. This is a change from previous generations that simply did not view politics as an effective vehicle for public activity. As a result they are changing politics by proving themselves to be a viable voting block. People running for office understand that the Millennials vote is critical.</p> \n<p>However, they are also easily disillusioned.</p> \n<p>According to a recent survey of young likely non-voters conducted by Harvard's Institute of Politics, 43 percent said it did not matter who was elected because ""Washington was broken;"" 31 percent said it did not matter because ""none of the candidates represented their views;"" and 25 percent said it did not matter because ""the parties were more or less the same."" Likewise, only 23 percent of Millennials are anticipated to vote in the upcoming 2014 midterm elections. Despite their disappointment, 53 percent are supportive of an activist government - more than any other generation ­- and believe government can be a force for good. The question will be how to channel this good energy into more effective and responsive democratic institutions. The candidate that could capture Millennials enthusiasm could potentially win their important votes.</p> \n<h3>2) They believe communities are critical to driving change</h3> \n<p> </p> \n<p>Twentysomethings are often stereotyped as too self-obsessed and stuck in their Facebook feeds to relate to the world around them. In reality, this generation volunteers at a higher rate than any other before it, and quite a bit of that social media time is spent on activism: 44 percent of Millennials who use social networking sites use social media to ""like"" or promote political material, 42 percent to post thoughts on issues, and 36 percent to encourage others to act.</p> \n<p>And through that volunteerism and social media activity, they're creating new forms of community to drive political change. Take <a href=""http://www.citizinvestor.com/"">Citizenvestor</a>, a crowdfunding platform for neighborhood projects. Or the way many used social media and networks to mobilize in Ferguson. They're also using <a href=""https://www.coworker.org/"">Coworker.org</a> to advocate for better workplaces.</p> \n<h3>3) Parties don't matter to them (as much)</h3> \n<p> </p> \n<p>This is a generation that leans left in its policy views, but doesn't like the idea of strongly affiliating with a partisan brand.</p> \n<p><b> </b></p> \n<p>In 2008, the Democratic ticket captured 66 percent of the share of young voters, aged 18-29 — a dramatic increase over previous elections. But even though Millennials consider themselves more socially liberal, they are more focused on pragmatic policy than party identification. They want to know what works and are less concerned with whether the solution comes from Democrats vs. Republicans or Government vs. Business.<span> </span>Even though the majority of this generation may continue to vote for Democratic candidates, they refuse to identify in this way. Half now describe themselves as political independents.</p> \n<p>Over time, this generation's political preferences could encourage candidates to talk about policy over partisanship. We've already seen candidates putting forth nuanced policy prescriptions into the public discourse. This generation's desire for solutions-based governance could ideally work to ease partisan contestation.</p> \n<h3>4) They believe change will come from both inside and outside government</h3> \n<p>The rise of young social entrepreneurs suggests that multi-sector actors can perhaps pick up where governments leave off. This recent trend, which marries business with social activism, emphasizes results and impact, and fits the career aspirations of a generation that wants to do meaningful work. Social enterprises, from Warby Parker to charity:water, have business plans that weave social impact into the bottom line.</p> \n<p>Young people are also thinking about how to have a ""tri-sector career,"" the popularized McKinsey term for a career spanning different sectors. That could mean, for example, holding jobs in business, government, and civil society.</p> \n<p>This multi-sector approach could inspire greater creativity and collaboration amongst typical professional siloes. Importantly, it could reinforce results over partisanship.</p> \n<h3>What this means for the future of civic participation</h3> \n<p>The optimistic take: this is a generation that can help usher in more participatory, collaborative forms of democratic governance that do not simply accept our <i>status quo</i> forms of civic engagement.</p> \n<p>But, that comes with a caveat: digital technologies have made people accustomed to a pace of change that does not reflect political realities. In other words, democracy ""on demand"" is not democracy at all. The instant gratification digital technologies enable, from online ordering to live steaming, is fundamentally different from the slow pace of people, politics, and institutions. The political reform this generation desires will require sustained effort and collective action. It will require making sacrifices and working long hours. It will require, in other words, using the strategies of generations past - marrying the new with the old.</p> \n<p><i>Hollie Russon Gilman  is a Civic Innovation Fellow @ New America.

But humanity fought back on two fronts. The first was the development of highly tuned immune systems. But the second was the development of behavioral responses  —  like the feeling of disgust when you smell rotted meat, or the shiver of fear you get when you see a rat —  that helped us avoid carriers of infection.</p> \n<p>Mark Schaller, an evolutionary psychologist at the University of British Columbia, calls this the ""behavioral immune system,"" and once researchers began looking for it, they found it everywhere.

As such, it makes a lot of sense for groups who are more vulnerable to disease outbreaks to fear foreigners.</p> \n<p>Researchers tested this by looking at whether people exhibited more xenophobia when they felt subjectively more vulnerable to infection. They did. In one <a href=""http://www.fed.cuhk.edu.hk/~lchang/material/Evolutionary/Pathogen/Faulkner%20et%20al%20(2004).pdf"" target=""_blank"">experiment</a>, Schaller  —  working alongside coauthors Jason Faulkner, Jason Park, and Leslie Duncan —  showed some people a series of pictures that focused on how easily bacteria could be transmitted in modern life and other people pictures showing how easily accidents could happen. The subjects cued to think about disease showed much more prejudice and fear toward immigrants they perceived as particularly foreign than did the subjects cued to think about accidents.</p> \n<p>It's not just xenophobia, and it's not just in labs. There have been a number of studies looking at whether high rates of infectious disease risk correlate with different kinds of governments and social behaviors in the real world. They do, and powerfully. As Ethan Watters writes in <a href=""http://www.psmag.com/navigation/health-and-behavior/bugs-like-made-germ-theory-democracy-beliefs-73958/"" target=""_blank"">an overview</a> of the evidence, researchers have found ""severe pathogen stress leads to high levels of civil and ethnic warfare, increased rates of homicide and child maltreatment, patriarchal family structures, and social restrictions regarding women's sexual behavior.""</p> \n<h3>How Ebola could twist American politics</h3> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""2396098"" alt=""Ebola protest"" src=""http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2396098/457386292.0.jpg""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Bill Clark/CQ Roll Call</p> \n<p>The claim here is radical and discomfiting: many of our cherished political beliefs and even cultural and religious practices are, on some level, a faux-rational rebranding of behaviors and attitudes developed to protect against disease. And the reemergence of infectious disease threats can trigger the reemergence of some of these latent beliefs and behaviors.</p> \n<p>Which brings us to Ebola, a threat that seems custom-designed to activate our worst instincts. It's an infectious disease, of course, and a particularly scary one at that. It comes from West Africa, and so it lights up the part of our evolutionary hardwiring that connects disease to foreigners. And we're hearing about it all day, every day. If the gentle, neutral mention of hand sanitizer can change someone's politics, what will the constant storm of Ebola coverage do?</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""right""><span>If the gentle, neutral mention of hand sanitizer can change someone's politics, what will the constant storm of Ebola coverage do?</span></q></p> \n<p><span>From the evolutionary perspective, what the American people want the government to do in response Ebola has been exactly what you would expect: there's been nearly instant pressure to shut down the borders and to quarantine anyone who has been anywhere near the foreigners. These ideas are wildly popular: a recent </span><a href=""http://truvenhealth.com/Portals/0/NPR-Truven-Health-Poll/NPRPulseEbola_Oct2014.pdf"" target=""_blank"">NPR poll</a><span> found that 77 percent of Americans supported a travel ban. </span></p> \n<p>As that poll suggests, this isn't really about Democrats and Republicans. When researchers say that infectious disease threats tend to increase traits associated with conservatism, they're talking about traits that run far deeper than party affiliation, and that can live in both parties simultaneously. What an infectious disease threat can do is shift the terms of the entire political system — both Democrats and Republicans will become a bit more closed to outsiders and mistrustful of change than they were before. These instincts long predate the invention of political parties.</p> \n<p>You can see it with the travel ban. As modern as a travel ban sounds — it's about airplanes, after all — it is, in its way, an example of our most ancient reactions to infectious diseases: to draw a clear line delineating who is ""us"" and who is ""them"" and then make sure the line doesn't get crossed. The problem is, in the modern world, these instincts, which really did work for a very long time, can be<span> counterproductive. ""These kinds of reactions may have been adaptive in the past,"" says Schaller, ""but in the current environment, there can be some really negative outcomes from these actions.""</span></p> \n<p><a style=""line-height: 1.5;"" href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/10/13/6964633/travel-ban-airport-screening-ebola-outbreak-virus"" target=""_blank"">Travel bans</a>, for instance, can lead to people hide their contact with Ebola victims, and thus spread the disease in ways we can't trace. They can also make it harder to get health workers and medical supplies to West Africa, where they're desperately needed if we're going to stop the Ebola outbreak. Quarantines effectively criminalize the health workers trying to stop Ebola in West Africa and <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/10/27/7074677/kaci-hickox-cnn-quarantine"" target=""_blank"">might lead</a> to fewer health workers willing to help victims.</p> \n<p>For most of human history our only defense against disease was to hide from it, and to shun outsiders who might bring new diseases to our tribes. But recent events have proven that we can't hide from Ebola.  A regional disease can turn into a global epidemic in an instant. The only way to stop Ebola in America is <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/10/22/7030475/the-key-to-stopping-ebola-in-america-is-stopping-it-in-west-africa"" target=""_blank"">to stop it in West Africa</a>. And that means our ancient instinct to close our borders won't work. Our only option is to fight Ebola together.</p>",Politics

The problem with marijuana ballot initiatives,http://www.vox.com/2014/10/30/7086135/marijuana-legalization-vote-2014-2016,Drug policy is much more complicated than a yes or no vote suggests.,"<p>Voters in <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/10/20/6953771/weed-legalization-alaska-florida-oregon-washington-dc-vote"">three states and Washington, DC</a>, will decide next Tuesday whether to <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/marijuana-legalization"">legalize marijuana</a> for recreational and medical purposes.<b></b></p> \n<p>Ballot initiatives can work well for some issues. If voters approve <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/same-sex-marriage/what-is-same-sex-marriage"">same-sex marriage</a>, the state isn't required to change much in the way of laws and regulations. Gay and lesbian couples can head to existing courthouses and get married. The state then has to acknowledge the couples and give them marriage-linked benefits. At most, the government might need to alter some forms to be more inclusive or neutral toward gender.</p> \n<p>But marijuana legalization can require setting up a huge regulatory framework for a brand new industry — a considerably larger venture than changing some forms. There are also different degrees of marijuana legalization that could be considered but aren't today due to limits in the ballot process.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""right"">Ballot initiatives typically lack nuance — often on purpose</q></p> \n<p>Ballot initiatives typically lack nuance — often on purpose. The initiatives are kept simple to avoid voter confusion and campaign attacks over vague or complicated language. The measures also aren't friendly to trial-and-error, since political campaigns tend to avoid anything that can look risky or prone to failure.</p> \n<p>This isn't necessarily legalization advocates' fault: legislatures rarely want to take on a hot-button issue like marijuana, leaving the ballot as the only option. Once the measures pass, legislatures are then legally unable or too politically risk-averse to change voter-approved measures.</p> \n<p>As a result, some ideas favored by experts are never considered. Here are three policy ideas left out of ballot initiatives — in part because they might be too complicated, and also because they could be too controversial for a direct vote.</p> \n<h3>1) Different forms of taxation</h3> \n<p><img src=""http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2314734/shutterstock_170654003.0.jpg"" alt=""marijuana money"" data-chorus-asset-id=""2314734""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">There's a lot of money to be made off marijuana taxes. But what's the right way to do it? (<a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.shutterstock.com"">Shutterstock</a>)</p> \n<p>In Washington and Colorado, retail marijuana is taxed at a percent of the sales price. In the initiatives on the ballot this year, recreational marijuana sales would be taxed based on each ounce sold.</p> \n<p>Beau Kilmer, co-director of RAND Drug Policy Research Center, suggested it could be better to tax marijuana products based on the amount of THC, the main psychoactive compound in pot, they contain. That way, the actual effect is being taxed — both to raise revenue from the most potent products and deter heavy users who might consume stronger forms of marijuana, such as dabs or <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/10/21/6995119/marijuana-legalization-pot-weed-edibles-candy-food"">edibles</a>, to placate their habit. ""It's perhaps the best way to tax for intoxication,"" Kilmer argued.</p> \n<p>Another model <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/magazine/march_april_may_2014/features/how_not_to_make_a_hash_out_of049291.php?page=all"">preferred</a> by Mark Kleiman, a drug policy expert at UCLA, would put a production cap on the amount of marijuana that can be grown within a state. The state would then hand out a limited number of licenses, constrained by the government-set limit, to the highest bidders. All the revenue raised from this auction would go to state coffers. Unlike a sales tax, the system would directly limit supply and, as a result, provide the state more control over products and prices.<b></b></p> \n<p><q class=""right"" aria-hidden=""true"">""No one is going to get this right the first few times it's attempted""</q></p> \n<p>""I want to take seriously the slogan that drug abuse is a public  health problem and not a criminal problem,"" Kleiman said. ""The answer is  you'd like to make [marijuana] relatively expensive — not so expensive  that people start producing it illegally, but, within that limit, pretty  expensive.""</p> \n<p>But these ideas are both much more complicated than simply pegging a sales tax to marijuana products. Not everyone knows what THC is or why it could be better to tax than actual marijuana products, and even experts are unsure about how to accurately measure and tax THC in plants and buds of pot. Similarly, it could be difficult for a campaign to explain why an auction model is necessary over a simple sales tax.</p> \n<p>It's also possible that none of these approaches work best. But if ballot initiatives lock a state into a certain tax structure, it could be too difficult to change in the future.</p> \n<p>""No one is going to get this right the first few times it's attempted,"" Kilmer said. ""We don't know the best way to tax marijuana, and you don't want to get locked into a regime that you realize over time, 'Wow, that wasn't the best way to do this.'""</p> \n<h3>2) User-set consumption caps</h3> \n<p><img src=""http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2402680/185493176.0.jpg"" alt=""marijuana joint"" data-chorus-asset-id=""2402680""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">A young man lights up a marijuana joint in Uruguay. (Pablo Porciuncula / AFP via Getty Images)</p> \n<p>One of Kleiman's <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/magazine/march_april_may_2014/features/a_nudge_toward_temperance049292.php"">favorite ideas</a> for limiting marijuana abuse is letting consumers restrict how much they buy. Marijuana users would individually decide how much pot they can purchase on a monthly or annual basis, and they wouldn't be allowed to buy more than that.</p> \n<p>This kind of approach isn't unprecedented. Uruguay, the first country to legalize marijuana, set a limit of 40 grams per month for all pot consumers, but Kleiman agreed that Uruguay's restrictive approach could just push people back to the black market or create a market for ""super pot"" that's high on THC but doesn't weigh much. At least with a user-set cap, some people might reasonably limit themselves without the drawbacks — although Kleiman acknowledged some people will set their limits too high.</p> \n<p>""I'm pretty sure user-set quota has more advantages than disadvantages compared to no quota at all,"" Kleiman said. ""Whether you should put a cap on that is a different question.""</p> \n<p>But Kleiman doubts such a scheme could ever pass through voters. It would be fairly experimental — even Kleiman conceded it might not work. And the finer details of such a system, including how the state would track people's marijuana consumption, would be fairly complicated and likely controversial for privacy advocates.</p> \n<h3>3) State monopolies<br>\n</h3> \n<p><img src=""http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2402688/460146575.0.jpg"" alt=""marijuana store"" data-chorus-asset-id=""2402688""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">A young woman weighs her options at a marijuana dispensary in Colorado. (Craig Walker / Denver Post via Getty Images)</p> \n<p>The state government could monopolize the sales and production of marijuana and sell it through state-run shops. This approach would give the state government total control over supply, prices, and who can access marijuana.</p> \n<p><a href=""http://www.rand.org/pubs/external_publications/EP50498.html"">A report</a> co-authored by Kilmer suggested this approach as one of many alternatives to the current legalization model. The report found that states that took this kind of approach with state-run liquor stores kept  alcohol prices higher, reduced youth access to alcohol, and lowered overall  levels of use and abuse.</p> \n<p>""There's a fair amount of literature showing that from a public health perspective that kind of state monopoly approach was better,"" Kilmer said. ""This may be the best approach for reducing the harms of prohibition but, at the same time, trying to keep protections on public health.""</p> \n<p>Federal prohibition, which remains in place even if states legalize marijuana, limits the possibility of this approach, since the state government can't compel state employees to break federal law by essentially acting as marijuana dealers.</p> \n<p><q class=""right"" aria-hidden=""true"">""Legalization isn't necessarily this binary decision""</q></p> \n<p>But such an approach could run into trouble at the ballot box, even if it was federally permissible. Not only could the finer details be fairly complicated, but voters that want to legalize marijuana might not be okay with turning their state government into a pot dealer.</p> \n<p>The problem, Kleiman and Kilmer emphasize, is that no drug policy is perfect. Turning the state into a drug dealer might seem like a wacky idea, but it could be better than a for-profit model that provides <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/9/23/6218695/case-against-pot-legalization-big-marijuana"">a financial incentive</a> to sell to heavy drug users, and it's certainly better than a <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/war-on-drugs-marijuana-cocaine-heroin-meth/war-on-drugs-goals"">war on drugs</a> that has fueled violent drug cartels. Voters are already being asked to decide between imperfect choices, even if they're not always aware of options beyond a yes or no at the ballot box.</p> \n<p>""Legalization isn't necessarily this binary decision,"" Kilmer said. ""The decisions you make about production and taxes and regulations, that's going to shape how this all plays out.""</p> \n<p><i>To learn more about marijuana legalization, read Vox's <a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/marijuana-legalization/what-is-marijuana-legalization""><i>card stack</i></a> and <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/10/20/6953771/weed-legalization-alaska-florida-oregon-washington-dc-vote"">full guide</a> to the states that could legalize pot in 2014, and watch the interview below:</i></p> \n<p><!-- CHORUS_VIDEO_EMBED ChorusVideo:43841 --></p>",Politics

When the Obama administration instituted the DACA program in 2012, they justified it by saying that they were limiting the program to a particular group of immigrants — and then using the application process to evaluate individual cases.</p> \n<p>Similarly, for this round of immigration relief, the administration will probably carve out one or more groups of unauthorized immigrants who will be eligible to apply, and then set an additional set of criteria that individuals in those groups will have to meet to get their applications approved.</p> \n<p>Here are the groups that are most likely to be eligible under a new program:</p> \n<p><b>Unauthorized immigrants whose children are US citizens or green-card holders. </b>There are <a href=""http://www.migrationpolicy.org/sites/default/files/publications/Executive-Action-Brief.pdf"" target=""_blank"">3.5 million</a> unauthorized immigrants with US-citizen children (in most cases because their kids were born in the US). <span>These immigrants should be eligible for legal status themselves, after their children turn 21. But they're blocked by rules that make it extremely difficult to get legal status in the US if you've ever been unauthorized — especially if you're not willing to risk leaving the US in the hopes that you might get to come back. </span><span>Another 150,000 immigrants are parents of green-card holders, and would have to wait even longer — assuming their children didn't become citizens — to get legal status in the US.</span></p> \n<p><b>Unauthorized immigrants who came as children or teenagers — who aren't already protected from deportation. </b>In 2012, Obama created the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which was intended to protect young unauthorized immigrants who would have qualified for the DREAM Act. The DACA program is limited to immigrants who arrived before 2007, and who were under the age of 30 when the program was announced. Expanding the program to older immigrants who arrived in the US as children, or to immigrant children and teenagers who arrived after 2007, could protect up to <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2014/11/13/source-obama-to-announce-10-point-immigration-plan-via-exec-action-as-early-as/"">300,000 more </a>immigrants from deportation.</p> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""639852"" alt=""jeanette vizguerra"" src=""http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/assets/4446123/114949882.jpg""></p> \n<p><span>Jeanette Vizguerra, a Colorado immigrant whose children are US citizens and who's been fighting her deportation.</span></p> \n<p><span>Here are a few other groups that haven't been mentioned in recent reports about the administration's plan — or about whom there are mixed reports:</span></p> \n<p><b>Possibly included: Unauthorized immigrants who are married to US citizens or green-card holders. </b>There are 1.5 million unauthorized immigrants in the US whose spouses have US citizenship, or at least a green card.

There are other criteria to consider as well. To qualify for DACA, for example, an immigrant has to meet a set of criteria regarding age, education, criminal record, and time in the United States. Not all of those will matter for other groups of immigrants (age requirements will likely be dropped) but others will.</p> \n<p>In particular, the administration is expected to require applicants to have been in the US for a certain number of years before they're eligible for relief. The DACA program required immigrants to have been in the US since at least 2007 — five years before the program went into effect. (That's why the current proposals include a plan to expand it to other immigrants who arrived as children after 2007.) By that standard, an estimated <a target=""_blank"" href=""file:///Users/brendanporath/Downloads/Executive-Action-Brief.pdf"">3.3 million </a>parents of US citizens or green-card holders would be eligible.</p> \n<p>The question is whether the White House will say that immigrants have to have been in the US for five years to be eligible for the new program, or whether it will require them to have been here for ten years. The higher standard <a target=""_blank"" href=""file:///Users/brendanporath/Downloads/Executive-Action-Brief.pdf"">could exclude </a>800,000 parents of US citizens or green-card holders. <span>Furthermore, it's going to be extremely hard for immigrants to prove when they entered the country without papers.</span></p>",Politics
"Did 40,000 voter registration application forms in Georgia just disappear?",http://www.vox.com/2014/10/31/7132171/georgia-missing-voter-registration-applications-lawsuit,A guide to the competing claims.,"<p>This year, Georgia is the site of some of the nation's most hotly-contested elections, including a close governor's race and a Senate contest that could determine control of the chamber. But recently, state and national headlines have been dominated by an allegation that 40,000 voter registration applications have mysteriously vanished. Here's a guide to the controversy that could affect some of this year's closest elections.</p> \n<h3>What's the dispute about?</h3> \n<p>The New Georgia Project, a voter registration effort led by the state's House Democratic leader, Stacey Abrams, says that it submitted more than 81,000 voter registration applications — many from young voters of color — before the state's deadline on October 6.</p> \n<p><span>As the election drew nearer, the Project double-checked the Secretary of State's list of eligible voters and its list of pending applications to ensure the applications were actually processed.

But Democrats argue <span>the problem of voter fraud is </span><a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.brennancenter.org/issues/voter-fraud"" style=""line-height: 1.5; background-color: #ffffff;"">practically nonexistent</a> — <span>and that efforts to crack down on it can end up suppressing turnout among minorities.

Gamergate and the politicization of absolutelyÂ everything,http://www.vox.com/2014/11/1/7136343/gamergate-and-the-politicization-of-absolutely-everything,Expect more GamerGates.,"<p>1. If you want to understand why <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/9/6/6111065/gamergate-explained-everybody-fighting"" target=""_blank"">Gamergate</a> has blown up, you could start with <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://pcl.stanford.edu/research/2014/iyengar-ajps-group-polarization.pdf"">a recent study</a> by Stanford University's Shanto Iyengar and Sean J. Westwood. They handed 1,000 people some sample student resumes and asked them to decide which deserved a scholarship. The resumes included clues to both the race and the political orientation of the applicant, as well as information about their grades.</p> \n<p>2. Race mattered. But political orientation mattered even more. Democrats and Republicans chose the resumes that shared their politics roughly 80 percent of the time. Of course, it's the grades themselves that should have driven the decisions — but the activation of political identity made grades pretty much irrelevant. <span>""We found no evidence that partisans took academic merit into account,"" the researchers wrote. </span></p> \n<p><q class=""center"" aria-hidden=""true""><span>at least under certain conditions, our political identities now trump our racial identities</span></q></p> \n<p>3. In another experiment, Iyengar and Westwood set up a game wherein player one received $10 and could give any amount they wanted to player two. Here, race didn't matter. But political affiliation did. People gave 24 percent more to their fellow partisans than they did when they didn't know anything about the other player.</p> \n<p>4. Iyengar and Westwood's conclusion is stark. ""Partisans discriminate against opposing partisans, and do so to a degree that exceeds discrimination based on race,"" they write. Think about that for a moment: at least under certain experimental conditions, our political identities now trump our racial identities.</p> \n<p>5. In fact, our political identities are now so powerful that they structure our reactions to racial controversies, as <a href=""http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/assets/4390073/teslersterling1.png"" target=""_blank"">this graph</a> of poll results from Brown University's Michael Tesler shows:</p> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""2410420"" alt=""race and politics"" src=""http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2410420/teslersterling1.0.png""></p> \n<p class=""caption""><a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2014/05/01/donald-sterling-shows-the-separate-realities-of-democrats-and-republicans-about-race/"">Michael Tesler/Monkey Cage</a></p> \n<p>6. This didn't used to be the case. Even a few decades ago, our political identities weren't strong enough to drive our reactions to racial controversies:</p> \n<p><img src=""http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2410448/teslersterling2.0.png"" alt=""politics and race older"" data-chorus-asset-id=""2410448""></p> \n<p><a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2014/05/01/donald-sterling-shows-the-separate-realities-of-democrats-and-republicans-about-race/"" style=""font-size: 0.8em; text-align: inherit; line-height: 1.5;"">Michael Tesler/The Monkey Cage</a></p> \n<p>7. This is the context for how #Gamergate has become so massive: we live in a world where politics leads to a 38-point gap on whether a movie about slavery should win an Oscar — an issue, for the record, that neither the Democratic nor Republican parties had any official, or even unofficial, position on. But partisans knew intuitively which side to take. They knew who their friends were, and they knew who their enemies were, and they knew which side would cheer if ""12 Years A Slave"" won the Oscar. Political identities aren't about tax cuts. They're about tribes.</p> \n<p><q class=""center"" aria-hidden=""true""><span>Political identities aren't about tax cuts. They're about tribes.</span></q></p> \n<p>8. This is the result of <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/congressional-dysfunction/what-is-political-polarization"">the incredible rise in political polarization</a> in recent decades. It used to be that both the Republican and Democratic parties included both liberals and conservatives. Since parties contained ideological multitudes, it was hard for them to be the basis of strong, personal identities. A liberal Democrat in New Jersey didn't have a lot in common with a conservative Democrat in Alabama. But now that's changed. The parties are sharply sorted by ideology. What were once fractious coalitions have become unified tribes.</p> \n<p>9. You can see the rise in political identity in the surveys on marriage. As Cass Sunstein <a href=""http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2014-09-22/partyism-now-trumps-racism"" target=""_blank"">writes</a>, ""in 1960, 5 percent of Republicans and 4 percent of Democrats said that they would feel 'displeased' if their son or daughter married outside their political party. By 2010, those numbers had reached 49 percent and 33 percent.""</p> \n<p><q class=""right"" aria-hidden=""true""><span>This is a world in which it was only a matter of time until video games were politicized</span></q></p> \n<p>10. This isn't a world in which we should be surprised that video games have been politicized. This is a world in which it was only a matter of time until video games were politicized. This is a world in which, sooner or later, most everything will get politicized.</p> \n<p>11. Though there are liberals <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/2kvezx/what_gamergate_has_taught_me_about_being_a/"">within</a> Gamergate and conservatives <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2014/10/28/gamergate_and_the_tea_party_why_tea_partiers_don_t_like_the_comparison.html"">opposing</a> it, the broad coalitions that have emerged around Gamergate are very clear. The conservative site Breitbart has been a leading source for Gamergaters convinced there's a media conspiracy against them. (Sample headline: ""<a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Hollywood/2014/10/25/While-the-Media-Slanders-Gamers-as-Terrorists-GamerGate-Is-Hunting-Trolls-and-Abusers"">WHILE THE MEDIA SLANDERS GAMERS AS ‘TERRORISTS,' GAMERGATE IS HUNTING TROLLS AND ABUSERS</a>."") Christina Hoff Sommers, a scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, has become the movement's protector against claims that it's anti-woman.</p> \n<center> \n<p><iframe frameborder=""0"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/5RVlCvBd21w"" height=""360"" width=""640""></iframe></p> \n</center> \n<p>12. On the other side, liberal opinion is in lockstep against Gamergate. Outlets ranging from Salon (""<a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.salon.com/2014/10/23/gamergate_is_really_about_terrorism_why_bill_maher_should_be_vilifying_the_gaming_community_too/%20"">#Gamergate is really about terrorism: Why Bill Maher should be vilifying the gaming community, too</a>"") to Gawker (""<a target=""_blank"" href=""http://jezebel.com/gamergate-trolls-arent-ethics-crusaders-theyre-a-hate-1644984010?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+jezebel%2Ffull+%28Jezebel%29&amp;utm_content=Google+Feedfetcher"">#Gamergate Trolls Aren't Ethics Crusaders; They're a Hate Group</a>"") to the Colbert Report have slammed the movement. The last, in particular, has created something of a cultural crisis within Gamergate, as the kinds of mostly young, mostly male, reasonably webby people who like Gamergate also like Colbert, and his rejection of them <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/2kv1dc/response_to_anitacolbert_interview_on_facebook/"">stings</a>.</p> \n<center> \n<div style=""background-color:#000000;width:520px;""> \n<div style=""padding:4px;""><iframe src=""http://media.mtvnservices.com/embed/mgid:arc:video:colbertnation.com:0cae72d8-cc8c-48eb-a21d-0f322090facb"" frameborder=""0"" height=""288"" width=""512""></iframe></div> \n</div> \n</center> \n<p> </p> \n<p>13. What's telling about the constellation of forces here is that none of them actually care much about video games. Prior to Gamergate, Sommers did not traffic in critical analyses of video gaming. Prior to Gamergate, Salon did not spend a lot of time writing about video games. Prior to Gamergate, the Colbert Report did not regularly cover gaming news. Rather, these are outlets and players that specialize in <i>political</i> conflict. And Gamergate has become a political conflict. Video games, at this point, are an excuse for that conflict.</p> \n<p><q class=""right"" aria-hidden=""true""><span>Gamergate has become a political conflict. Video games, at this point, are an excuse for that conflict.</span></q></p> \n<p>14. It's worth stopping for a moment to say that Gamergate, as well as the reaction against it, isn't any one thing. It includes horrifying, probably criminal, harassment against pretty much any women who dare oppose it. It's partly an argument about what kinds of games the gaming press should cover — and, by extension, what kinds of games developers should make. It has members who want clearer disclosure policies in gaming journalism. It has a lot of people who joined because they hate feminism and internet ""social justice"" warriors. And it has many people, on both sides, who are far surer about who they're fighting than what they're fighting about.</p> \n<p>15. One thing that comes clear when you spend much time reading inside the Gamergate community is the feeling of being misunderstood — and, for that matter, smeared — is very, very real. If you're reading about Gamergate on the left, virtually all you're reading about is the intense, horrifying harassment against women that's happening under Gamergate's banner. If you're reading about Gamergate from inside Gamergate, virtually all you're reading about is how the media is smearing Gamergate by equating it with harassers who don't represent the movement's real tactics or goals (some Gamergaters even believe the trolls are part of a false flag operation meant to discredit Gamergate). Gamergaters are furious that the media focuses on all the bullying happening under Gamergate rather than all the <a href=""http://www.jbgnews.com/2014/10/members-of-gamergate-raise-over-16000-for-bullying-prevention-charity/042806.html"" target=""_blank"">money Gamergaters are raising</a> for anti-bullying efforts. Anti-Gamergaters are furious that Gamergate focuses more on bad jokes from Gawker than the monsters in its midst.</p> \n<p><q class=""center"" aria-hidden=""true""><span>Within Gamergate, there's a deep sense of conspiracy</span></q></p> \n<p>16. Within Gamergate, there's a deep sense of conspiracy — the belief is that the reaction to their campaign has been so unfair and so overwhelming that the only possible explanation is a wide-ranging conspiracy. Much of the subreddit <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/"">Kotaku In Action</a> is dedicated to try to untangle this sinister web. This has led to some...odd theories. <span>People have reported that, as editor of Vox.com, I </span><a href=""https://twitter.com/GitGudGG/status/527417272856756224"" target=""_blank"" style=""line-height: 1.5; background-color: #ffffff;"">own or run</a><span> </span><span>Polygon.com, despite the fact that Polygon has been around a lot longer than Vox.com (the confusion here stems from the fact that both sites share the same corporate parent, Vox Media).</span><span> They've suggested that ""weird Twitter"" is secretly controlled by Nick Denton, founder of Gawker Media. </span><span>But the sense of siege is very real within Gamergate. ""This is a gamers vs. the media issue,"" says the top-voted comment on</span><a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/2kqvad/to_our_new_visitors_a_guide/"" target=""_blank""> the guide</a><span> to Kotaku In Action.</span></p> \n<blockquote class=""twitter-tweet"" lang=""en""> \n<p>If indeed Weird Twitter is Nick Denton's private troll army, the rabbit hole goes far deeper than any of us could have imagined. <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/GamerGate?src=hash"">#GamerGate</a></p> \n— Matt Forney (@realmattforney) <a href=""https://twitter.com/realmattforney/status/525894163112267776"">October 25, 2014</a>\n</blockquote> \n<p> \n<script charset=""utf-8"" src=""//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js""></script> \n</p> \n<p>17. All this, too, is common within political conflict in polarized times: the two sides segregate into completely separate information loops. Politicized media outlets and activist information sources have incentives to cover the worst of the other side, and to play to the fear, anger and even paranoia of their own side. Structurally, each side only becomes familiar with the most extreme members and interpretations of the other side — and so comes to loathe and fear them even more.</p> \n<p>18. The point here is not that both sides are equal, or equivalent. <span>It's not even obvious that there are two sides here, so much as there are two coalitions, each with multiple sides and competing interests. </span><span>And no one should dismiss the very real, very dangerous harassment that's happening under Gamergate's banner. The point here is that the Gamergate fight is now being partly driven by forces that have nothing to do with the video gaming industry, or even with gamers. Forces that are very good at making these kinds of conflicts worse and deeper. Forces that will be around long after Gamergate dies down. Forces that will create the next Gamergate.</span></p> \n<p>19. A lot of the people glomming onto Gamergate are doing so because they're angry at the way the ""social justice left"" has been able to set some of the terms of online discourse. <span>In Gamergate, they saw a point of weakness — a way to make gains in a fight they've otherwise been losing. You can see this in a lot of Breitbart's </span><a style=""line-height: 1.5; background-color: #ffffff;"" href=""http://www.breitbart.com/Breitbart-London/2014/09/01/Lying-Greedy-Promiscuous-Feminist-Bullies-are-Tearing-the-Video-Game-Industry-Apart"" target=""_blank"">coverage</a><span>, which makes clear this isn't about video games so much as it's a new front in a larger battle:</span></p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>It's easy to mock video gamers as dorky loners in yellowing underpants. Indeed, in previous columns, I've done it myself. Occasionally at length. But, the more you learn about the latest scandal in the games industry, the more you start to sympathise with the frustrated male stereotype. Because an army of sociopathic feminist programmers and campaigners, abetted by achingly politically correct American tech bloggers, are terrorising the entire community - lying, bullying and manipulating their way around the internet for profit and attention.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>This resonates with a lot of Gamergaters, who though they see themselves as liberals, they feel dismissed and even hated by the social justice left — they're for equal pay and they voted for Barack Obama, so why are they being made the enemy just because the women in their games have skimpy outfits?</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""right""><span>They're for equal pay and they voted for Barack Obama, so why are they being made the enemy?</span></q></p> \n<p>20. On the left, the interest in Gamergate also isn't about games so much as it's about the widespread problem of women being harassed on the internet — a problem that existed, and was getting a lot of attention, well before Gamergate, but that Gamergate threw into particularly sharp relief. And every time someone from Gamergate tries to change the subject from women being driven from their homes by death threats to ""ethics in game journalism,"" it looks like proof that they just don't take the problem of online sexual harassment seriously.</p> \n<p>21. Broad media coverage of Gamergate doesn't focus on the debates about how video games should be reviewed and by whom because the media doesn't much care about video game reviews. They care, on the right, about political correctness and speech policing, and on the left, about sexism and online harassment. Gamergate happens to be about video games but it could be about anything. Video games are the excuse for this fight, not the cause of it.</p> \n<p>22. Some of the tactics that Gamergaters have innovated are going to be turned around with even more force. I agree with Vox's Todd VanDerWerff, who <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/10/30/7130683/gamergate-gawker-destroy"" target=""_blank"">thinks</a> it's a chilling innovation to focus activism campaigns on the technology companies that run the ad platforms rather than the advertisers themselves. But Gamergate isn't going to convince Amazon or Google to yank web services from anyone. Gamergate doesn't have the cultural capital to do that; being against Gamergate isn't socially dangerous in San Francisco or Seattle.</p> \n<p><q class=""center"" aria-hidden=""true""><span>Ruling beliefs culturally repugnant is a game that the left is better at playing these days</span></q></p> \n<p>23. But being against, say, marriage equality really can be dangerous right now. Remember when the CEO of Mozilla was <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2014/04/03/mozillas-ceo-steps-down-amid-gay-marriage-furor/"">driven from his job</a> because he donated, as a private citizen, to a campaign against gay marriage? It's easy to imagine a reverse Gamergate that's much more effective in tearing revenue from rightwing media outlets that place themselves on the wrong side of a social justice fight. In the long-run, that would be a disaster for the media as a whole. My hope — and my guess — is that advertisers and web services will quickly acclimate to this new climate and these new organizing tactics, just as they have in the past. But ugly stuff can happen in transition.</p> \n<p><span>24. Gamergate is going to happen again. As polarization proceeds, our political identities become powerful enough to drive our other identities. As Washington locks up, the political outlets that normally spend their time covering fights in Congress need to find fights that will engage their audience elsewhere. As cultural mores change ever more rapidly, the battles over what's acceptable to say and do will become even fiercer. And as everyone becomes more and more dependent on web traffic, skirmishes with deep digital roots will become increasingly attractive to cover.</span></p> \n<p>25. The result will be a cycle we'll soon come to recognize: glancingly political fights will attract coverage from professionally politicized outlets and quickly be turned into deeply politicized wars. Once political identities are activated, these fights will spread far beyond their natural constituencies — in the Gamergate case, people who care about video games — and become part of the ongoing conflict between the red and blue tribes. Expect more Gamergates.</p>",Politics

On November 4, remember your rights: here are six things that aren't supposed to happen when you're casting a ballot.</span></p> \n<h3>1. Threats or intimidation</h3> \n<p style=""font-size: 15.5555562973022px;""><b></b></p> \n<p style=""font-size: 15.5555562973022px;"">It's illegal under federal law for people to conspire to ""injure, oppress, threaten, or intimidate"" you to get you to vote a particular way for President, Vice President, or — notably for midterm elections — a member of Congress.</p> \n<p style=""font-size: 15.5555562973022px;"">""Historically, particularly before the Civil Rights era in the South, there was a lot of intimidation at the polls in predominantly African-American neighborhoods,"" said Ho.   ""Obviously, we've come a long way, and the violent tactics have become essentially unheard of, but you still see instances where people are discouraged from voting because of harassment — by people who claim to be poll watchers who are overly aggressive, or with the improper deployment of law enforcement personnel at polling places.""</p> \n<p style=""font-size: 15.5555562973022px;"">One thing to be on the lookout for: a poll worker who intimidates you by asking you for more information than is legally required to vote.  Ho said he's seen allegations of poll workers requiring voters' addresses to match their addresses in the poll book. That goes way beyond the identity verification that any state requires.</p> \n<p style=""font-size: 15.5555562973022px;"">Another form of intimidation is the kind that comes from everyday citizens who have made it their mission to fight voter fraud (or, depending on whom you ask, make voting hard and scary for <a href=""http://talkingpointsmemo.com/muckraker/doj-probes-tx-voter-intimidation-complaints-during-tea-party-anti-voter-fraud-drive"" target=""_blank"">certain people</a>). ""We've seen people who work for so-called ballot integrity organizations try to conduct match lists where they take the voter rolls and match them to a list of, say, convicted felons, or a list of non-citizens,  often in a really inaccurate way, [in an attempt] to find people who are ineligible and wait for them at the polling place,"" Ho said.</p> \n<p style=""font-size: 15.5555562973022px;"">Yes, that's right. These self-appointed monitors do research, and then approach total strangers and suggest to them, based on information that may or may not be correct, that they can't vote. <span>Federal law protects against this, and citizens can sue people or groups who are trying to use intimidation to keep them from voting.</span></p> \n<p style=""font-size: 15.5555562973022px;""><b></b></p> \n<p style=""font-size: 15.5555562973022px;"">You also aren't supposed to be hassled about who to vote for when you're trying to vote. State statutes vary when it comes to how far away campaign volunteers must stay from polling places, but every state places some limit on this to protect voters, said Ho. So if you're approached or handed materials when you're at or very near the place where you'll case your ballot, that's cause for concern.</p> \n<h3><span>2. Getting shut out of the polling place after waiting in line</span></h3> \n<p style=""font-size: 15.5555562973022px;""><b></b></p> \n<p style=""font-size: 15.5555562973022px;"">There's no specific law addressing how long is too long when it comes to waiting in line to vote, but Ho said waits as short as an hour and as long as 8 hours have been found by courts to violate voters' rights.</p> \n<p style=""font-size: 15.5555562973022px;""><b></b></p> \n<p style=""font-size: 15.5555562973022px;"">Regardless of how long the line, the important thing is that you must be allowed to vote as long as you're <i>in it</i> before the polls close. So if you're in the back of a long line at 7:25 and there are still several people ahead of you when the polls close at 7:30 (if that's the closing time at your polling place), you can't be turned away.</p> \n<h3>3. Overzealous ID checks</h3> \n<p><span>Voter ID laws require voters to show some form of identification, such as a driver's license or passport, at the polls before they cast a vote. States without voter ID laws generally have <a sl-processed=""1"" target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/voter-verification-without-id-documents.aspx"">""non-documentary"" identification requirements</a>, under which voters can verify their identity in other ways, such as by signing an affidavit or poll book, or by providing personal information like their address or birth date.</span></p> \n<p>Since 2010,  many state legislatures have passed laws requiring that people show identification before casting a ballot. These laws have been challenged in court with varying degrees of success.</p> \n<p><span>As a result, </span><a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/voting-rights-fight-explained/what-are-voter-id-laws"" target=""_blank"">voter ID laws</a><span> vary widely from state to state, so the identification you'll need to provide at the polls could range from nothing, to a utility bill, to a state-issued ID. </span><a style=""font-size: 15.5555562973022px; line-height: 1.5; background-color: #ffffff;"" href=""http://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/voter-id.aspx"">Thirty-four states</a><span> have laws on the books requiring voters to show some form of identification at the polls, and in 31 of those states, the law will be enforceable on November 4.</span></p> \n<p><span>This map, from the National Council of State Legislatures, shows how each state handles voter identification. </span></p> \n<p style=""font-size: 15.5555562973022px;""><img src=""http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2412776/VoterIDLaws.cropped.0.0.jpeg"" alt=""VoterIDLaws.cropped.0.0.jpeg"" data-chorus-asset-id=""2412776""></p> \n<p style=""text-align: start;"" class=""caption"">(<a style=""font-size: 15.5555562973022px; line-height: 1.5;"" target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/voter-id.aspx"">National Council of State Legislatures)</a></p> \n<p style=""text-align: start;"" class=""caption""> </p> \n<p>The <a href=""http://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/voter-id.aspx"" target=""_blank"">N</a><a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/voter-id.aspx"">ational Council of State Legislatures</a> also has a list of the specific forms of ID that are accepted in each state, as well as information on the options available to voters who can't provide the required ID.</p> \n<p>It's important to know <a href=""http://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/voter-id.aspx"" target=""_blank"">your state's law</a>, because any poll worker who requires you to provide more ID than required is violating your rights. Ho said that he's aware of cases in Wisconsin and Texas — states that require photo identification — in which poll workers have gone too far, requiring that the address on a voter's identification matches the address on the rolls, when all that's actually required is that the voter's name and face match his or her identification.</p> \n<p><b> </b></p> \n<p><b> </b></p> \n<h3>4. Getting turned away without casting a provisional ballot</h3> \n<p><b> </b></p> \n<p>State voter ID laws differ when it comes to what happens to voters who can't produce the required identification. States with strict voter ID laws require voters who don't have the proper ID to vote using a provisional ballot and then take additional steps after Election Day (for example, returning to the election office with an ID) to ensure that their votes are counted.</p> \n<p>States with less restrictive voter ID laws may let a person vote if he or she signs an affidavit certifying his or her identity, or they may allow election workers to verify whether the person was registered without the voter having to take any further action.</p> \n<p><span>In any case, said Ho, while state laws differ when it comes to what happens if you fail to provide the proper ID and have to cast a provisional ballot, under federal law, poll workers are required to, at the very least, give you a provisional ballot.</span></p> \n<p>Don't leave without casting one, even if you've forgotten your entire wallet, and even if the poll worker tries to send you away before you do.</p> \n<h3>5. No polling place can accommodate your disability</h3> \n<p>Polling places are required by federal law to be accessible to people with disabilities. If your own polling place isn't suitable — unable to  accommodate wheelchairs, for example — he <a href=""http://codi.tamucc.edu/archives/legislation/voting.access.htm"">Voting Accessibility for the Elderly and Handicapped Act of 1984</a>requires election officials to make sure you have an alternate way to cast a ballot.</p> \n<p>Most states will allow curbside voting (a poll worker runs a ballot out to you, and you complete it in your car) if you can't make it inside.</p> \n<p>The law also requires the availability of voting aids for disabled and elderly voters. So don't be afraid to ask.</p> \n<p><b></b></p> \n<p><b> </b></p> \n<p><b> </b></p> \n<h3><span>6.

More recent polls have given an edge to Orman, but it's hard to predict how his odd independent status might swing the results. For instance, his lack of a party-funded turnout operation could hurt him. Then again, his lack of association with the Democratic Party might lead Kansas swing voters to back him, even as swing voters in other states seem to be backing Republicans.</p> \n<h3><span>4) Alaska Senate: Sen.

Davis and Battleground Texas hoped to start that trend this year. Yet the two most recent polls of the race show her going down in a landslide defeat.</p> \n<p>If Davis does perform worse than the Democrats' 2010 nominee Bill White, who lost by 12.7 percentage points in a Republican year, the activists trying to turn Texas blue will be rather demoralized.

2014 midterm elections: 5 reasons we might not know who wins the Senate for weeks,http://www.vox.com/2014/11/4/7146913/midterm-elections-2014-senate-race,"Recounts, runoffs, and independents, oh my.","<p>Today is <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/11/3/7150951/midterm-election-2014-live-updates-results-polls-predictions-2014"" target=""_blank"">Election Day</a>, and people in 34 states are holding Senate elections (in Oklahoma and South Carolina, both seats are up for grabs). But we might not know whether the GOP has succeeded in retaking the Senate for days — or even weeks. Here are five reasons why.</p> \n<p><i></i></p> \n<h3>1) Slow and late counts</h3> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""2416192"" alt=""Mark Begich"" src=""http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2416192/490116267.0.jpg""></p> \n<div style=""text-align:center""> \n<p class=""caption"">Sen. Mark Begich of Alaska. (Bill Clark / CQ-Roll Call / Getty)</p> \n</div> \n<p>The first reason we might go to bed without knowing who won is, simply, that some states might not have counted enough votes yet. Some states start their counts later because they keep their polls open longer, and returns from Western states will come in very late in East Coast time . Other states just count more slowly, either because they have spread-out rural populations, or because of inefficiency.</p> \n<p>When the race looks fairly close, and not enough votes are in, media organizations will usually be hesitant to ""call"" a race. In the 2008 Oregon Senate race, Jeff Merkley ended up beating his opponent by 3.3 percentage points, but due to slow vote-counting, that margin wasn't immediately clear, and his race <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/11/06/moderate-republican-falls-in-oregon-senate-race/"">wasn't called</a> until two days after Election Day.</p> \n<p>Sometimes, the wait can be even longer. <span>Senator Mark Begich of Alaska is up for reelection this year — and when he last ran, in 2008, his race </span><a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/11/18/AR2008111803227.html"">wasn't called</a><span> for two weeks. Alaska is a huge state, with ballots being cast in many sparsely-populated areas. </span><span>So if Begich's race is close again, we could be waiting on Alaska's vote count for quite some time.</span></p> \n<h3>2) Recounts</h3> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""2425898"" alt=""Recount map"" src=""http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2425898/Recount_Map.0.png""></p> \n<div style=""text-align:center""> \n<p class=""caption"">(Estelle Caswell / Vox Media)</p> \n</div> \n<p>Regardless of how quickly the count goes, if the race is close enough, many states require a recount. In some states, there are specific automatic thresholds to trigger state-funded recounts. In others, candidates or voters have to petition for a recount.</p> \n<p>The <a href=""http://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/automatic-recount-thresholds.aspx"" target=""_blank"">National Conference of State Legislatures website</a> to see what the rules are for your state. For the closest Senate states, only two have rules for automatic recounts. Alaska's occurs in the case of an exact tie. Colorado has a <a href=""http://ceimn.org/ceimn-state-recount-laws-searchable-database/states/Colorado"" target=""_blank"">more complex formula</a> for determining whether a recount occurs, but it will basically only happen if the top two candidates are separated by just a few thousand votes. <span>Whether recounts happen in the other key Senate states will depend on whether the loser petitions for one.</span></p> \n<h3>3) Lawsuits</h3> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""689342"" alt=""Al Franken"" src=""http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/689342/112843878.0.jpg""></p> \n<div style=""text-align:center""> \n<p class=""caption"">Al Franken. (Rafael Suanes/MCT/Getty)</p> \n</div> \n<p>In Al Franken's incredibly close 2008 Minnesota Senate election, his post-recount margin was a mere 225 votes — a margin that was 0.007 percent of the total vote cast. During the recount, lawyers on both sides contested hundreds of ballots, and most of those went to Franken.</p> \n<p>So his opponent, Senator Norm Coleman, argued that there were irregularities in the recount that swung the result — and filed suit in court. <span>The resulting legal battle lasted nearly 6 months, until the Minnesota Supreme Court ruled in Franken's favor in late June 2009. He was finally sworn in the following month. </span></p> \n<h3>4) Runoffs</h3> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""2426138"" alt=""Runoffs graphic final"" src=""http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2426138/runoffs_finalv2.0.png""></p> \n<div style=""text-align:center""> \n<p class=""caption"">(Estelle Caswell / Vox Media)</p> \n</div> \n<p>Two states with contested Senate races — Louisiana and Georgia — have runoff laws, in which a candidate will only win on Election Night<span> if he or she wins more than 50 percent of the vote. Otherwise, a runoff election will be triggered with only the top two vote-getters. Louisiana's would be in December, and Georgia's in January.</span></p> \n<p>This could make it difficult to declare a victor in the battle for the Senate. In Louisiana, <span>Democrat Mary Landrieu is considered highly likely to lose her eventual runoff. But she almost certainly won't lose outright on election night, because two conservative candidates are splitting the vote. </span><span>In Georgia, a runoff isn't as certain but is quite possible, as a libertarian </span><span>candidate has been picking up a few percentage points in </span><a target=""_blank"" href=""http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/2014-georgia-senate-perdue-vs-nunn"" style=""line-height: 1.5; background-color: #ffffff;"">polls</a><span> of the close contest. </span></p> \n<p>If control of the Senate still hangs in the balance, these runoffs will become nationalized. Conservative outside groups will spend millions arguing that a vote for the Democrat is now certain to keep the Senate in Harry Reid's hands, a potent argument in two heavily conservative states.</p> \n<p>So if these races do go to a runoff, Democrats will likely have a tough time. Then again, b<span>oth of these states are expected to go to the GOP anyway, so runoffs may prevent Mitch McConnell from locking down a majority for another month or more. And a runoff effectively</span><span> resets the vote clock and will allow for weeks of additional campaigning, which could change voters' minds.</span></p> \n<h3>5) The independent</h3> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""2360822"" alt=""Greg Orman"" src=""http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2360822/Orman.0.jpg""></p> \n<div style=""text-align:center""> \n<p class=""caption"">Greg Orman (Greg Orman for Senate)</p> \n</div> \n<p>And then there's Greg Orman, the independent challenging incumbent Republican Pat Roberts in Kansas. If Republicans end up with a clear majority of 51 seats or more, or Democrats win 50 seats, Orman's decision won't determine party control. <span>(Democrats only need 50 seats for a majority because Vice President Biden gets to cast tie-breaking votes.) He's said that he'll caucus with whichever party wins a clear majority in this case.</span></p> \n<p>However, if the GOP ends up with 50 seats and the Democrats 49, Orman's decision on who to caucus with will determine which party has a majority. <span>Orman's </span><a style=""line-height: 1.5; background-color: #ffffff;"" href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/9/4/6103485/kansas-senate-pat-roberts-chad-taylor-greg-orman"">positions</a><span> and </span><a style=""line-height: 1.5; background-color: #ffffff;"" href=""http://www.wibw.com/home/headlines/Democrats-To-Host-NYC-Fundraiser-For-Greg-Orman-279259372.html"">financial backers</a><span> </span><span>seem to indicate he'd be more at home in the Democratic caucus, and most people assume he'll caucus with Democrats if his vote turns out to be decisive. But if he hopes to build a long-term political career in Kansas, siding with the GOP might be the better bet.</span></p> \n<p>Considering that the likely runoffs in Lousiana and Georgia, and the possibility of slow counts and recounts in other states, might leave the control of the Senate up in the air for weeks or months, it's really unclear when Orman will make his decision.</p>",Politics
Why more partisanship can cure what ails American politics,http://www.vox.com/2014/11/3/7149487/klarner-reynolds-dogers-schleicher,"When parties work well, they empower voters. But a federal system needs federal parties.","<p>Partisanship is in part a tribal phenomenon, and like other aspects of tribalism it at times inspires irrational and ugly behavior. It rears its head most prominently at election time. And, ironically, since elections are swung by voters who <i>lack</i> strong partisan attachments, each autumn witnesses strong partisans bemoaning the partisanship of their adversaries and praising the independent-mindedness of their own favored candidates. The truth, however, is that for all its flaws partisanship is a bit like democracy itself — the worst idea around except for all the available alternatives.</p> \n<p>And many of the flaws in American government can be laid at the feet not of the much-derided partisanship but at a <i>lack</i> of partisanship. Specifically, our combination of a decentralized federal system — which sees very different issues debated on Capitol Hill, in the statehouse, or at City Hall — and a system of parties which is overwhelmingly focused on federal matters has worsened local governance. For better politics in the future, we need not less partisanship but more — and more parties to go with it.</p> \n<h3>Parties provide information</h3> \n<blockquote lang=""en"" class=""twitter-tweet""> \n<p>Spotted in Louisville, the best Mitch McConnell sticker. <a href=""http://t.co/uRgFOYyr9v"">pic.twitter.com/uRgFOYyr9v</a></p> \n— Molly Ball (@mollyesque) <a href=""https://twitter.com/mollyesque/status/529291127846105088"">November 3, 2014</a>\n</blockquote> \n<p>The greatest virtue of political parties is that partisanship — where it works — provides crucial information. I have not been following the US Senate election happening in Iowa this year very closely. But if were to materialize in an Iowa City voting booth tomorrow morning, I'd have <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/9/15/6127683/candidate-quiz"" target=""_blank"">no trouble whatsoever figuring out</a> who to vote for. That's because the partisan affiliations of Bruce Braley and Joni Ernst tell me an <i>awful lot</i> about what they would do in DC. In the short-term, Braley would give broad deference to Obama's executive appointments while Ernst will seek to prevent jobs from being filled in a timely manner. In the longer-term, Braley will vote for more progressive taxes and Ernst for less spending on social services.</p> \n<p>In some states, voters will find themselves conflicted. Many people in Kentucky seem to share mainstream Democratic views on taxes and the minimum wage, while agreeing more with the GOP on environmental regulations and abortion. But even when the choice is a tough one, the party affiliations of Mitch McConnell and Allison Lundergan Grimes do a great job of broadly structuring the options.</p> \n<p>Contrast this with a non-partisan election like the battle to become Washington, DC's first elected attorney-general. Absent partisan cues, even dedicated followers of local affairs are starting at square one. Even the best journalists following DC politics struggle to define what <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/dc-politics/first-ever-dc-attorney-general-race-often-strays-far-from-the-letter-of-the-law/2014/10/18/71fd1084-54c6-11e4-809b-8cc0a295c773_story.html"" target=""_blank"">issues divide the candidates</a>, and endorsements seem to be happening largely on the basis of affect.

Mark Udall on the trail. (Mark Piscotty/Getty)</p> \n<p>By definition, a person can only have a few top priorities. That reality extends to politicians. And if the candidates on offer don't have a particular interest on the issue you're most passionate about, that can make deciding between them difficult. Parties, by linking politicians into broad networks of like-minded colleagues, help bridge these gaps of concern. The parties as collectives address many more issues passionately than an individual person could or would. Meanwhile, though the candidates represent particular constituencies, their partisan affiliations prevent them from lapsing into complete parochialism.</p> \n<p>The voters of Colorado will decide who will represent them in the US Senate, but this choice has national implications. Because both candidates are affiliated with national parties, both contestants can be held somewhat accountable for the actions of national party leaders. This ensures a focus that keeps at least one eye on the national interest, alongside local state concerns.</p> \n<h3>Partisanship gone wrong</h3> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""2418210"" alt=""Screen_Shot_2014-11-03_at_11.28.13_AM.0.png"" src=""http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2418210/Screen_Shot_2014-11-03_at_11.28.13_AM.0.png""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">(Steven Michael Rogers)</p> \n<p>Though pundits bemoan partisanship on Capitol Hill, the American party system works quite well when it comes to congressional elections. The problems arise further down the chain of command. State governments in the United States are given considerable autonomy from federal policy. They take the lead on several issues (education, transportation) where the federal government has a merely secondary role, and take the backseat on several issues (size of the welfare state, distribution of the tax burden) where the federal government is the primary authority. Yet, as political scientists Carl Klarner and C.L. Reynolds <a href=""http://sppc2014.indiana.edu/Papers/Klarner%20and%20Reynolds.pdf"" target=""_blank"">have found</a>, voters do not act as if state and federal governments do different things.</p> \n<p>Instead, they find, over a long historical period, a 0.93 percent correlation between the change in the number of US House of Representatives seats the Democrats pick up in the number of state legislature seats they gain. In principle, this could be because local conditions drive voting for federal elections. But in practice, through statistical analysis, they conclude the reverse: ""When federal officers are up — which they often are — voters do not seem to reward or punish state officials on the basis of state conditions."" Steven Michael Rodgers, <a href=""http://www.stevenmrogers.com/Dissertation/Rogers-Dissertation.pdf"" target=""_blank"">similarly</a>, finds that ""compared to individuals' assessments of the state legislature, changes in presidential approval have at least three times the impact on voters' decision-making in state legislative elections.""</p> \n<p>In other words, strong partisan cues about federal policy overwhelm information about state policy. That makes state government less accountable and effective than it should be.</p> \n<p>But the alternative of non-partisan elections is bad as well. Law professor David Schleicher made this point by <a href=""http://www.yalelawjournal.org/pdf/1162_m41e7ifa.pdf"" target=""_blank"">looking at municipal elections in the United States</a>. These are sometimes formally non-partisan and other times de facto non-partisan due to the overwhelming dominance of the Democratic Party. He finds that city council members face little pressure to articulate city-wide visions, or reconcile local interests with broader priorities. This leads to hyper-empowerment of people inclined to cry Not In My Back Yard to proposals for new construction of any kind. If council-members were forced to organize as disciplined teams, the teams would have to form and articulate views on the most desirable city-wide approach to development. But absent partisanship, the tendency is toward incoherence. Everyone wants more affordable housing, and everyone wants it somewhere else.</p> \n<h3>More parties for better partisanship</h3> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""2418206"" alt=""shutterstock_163363169.0.0.jpg"" src=""http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2418206/shutterstock_163363169.0.0.jpg""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">These guys know what's up (Shutterstock)</p> \n<p>To see a better approach to federalism, Americans should look north of the border to our friends in Canada. In Canada, like in the USA, the issues that matter most in provincial government are not the same as the issues that matter most in federal government. Canada's approach to this is to have <i>separate party systems</i> for the separate levels of government. One might be a loyal backer of the Québec Liberal Party, while voting for the Conservative Party of Canada in national elections. Importantly, this wouldn't be ""ticket splitting"" in the American sense. Different parties appear on the ballot in provincial versus federal elections. There is no Québécois political party called ""conservative,"" and backing the provincial Liberal Party does not imply membership in the federal Liberal Party. They're just different organization altogether.</p> \n<p>In a system like that, rather than awkwardly partnering as leaders of the Democratic Party in New York State, Bill de Blasio and Andrew Cuomo could be leaders of rival political parties. Voters in Colorado's Senate election could and would largely base their votes on their assessment of the Obama-versus-Republicans battle in DC, but their votes for governor and state legislature could be unpolluted by these dynamics. Questions about school management, land use, and transportation planning that the federal government doesn't do much on would get a full and thorough hearing in the races where they matter.</p> \n<p>What ails us right now, however, is not too much partisanship but too little.

"This week's revealingly silly ""scandal"" in US-Israel relations",http://www.vox.com/2014/11/3/7149953/us-israel-susan-rice-ron-dermer-scandal,What Susan Rice snarking Israel's ambassador says about the state of US-Israel relations,"<p>In the latest of what will surely be many diplomatic slights between the Israeli and US governments, National Security Advisor Susan Rice reportedly <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/.premium-1.624228"">said something less than glowing</a> about the Israeli Ambassador to the US, Ron Dermer. The leader of a major American Jewish organization reportedly asked Rice, in a private meeting, why she had not met with Dermer since he'd taken office in September 2013.</p> \n<p>""He never asked to meet me,"" she responded. <span>""Besides, I understood that he's too busy traveling to Sheldon Adelson's events in Las Vegas."" </span></p> \n<p><span>Adelson is a wealthy conservative fundraiser known for his right-wing activism on issues related to Israel. </span><span>The quote is news in Israel and on right-leaning US sites, where it's taken as further evidence that the Obama administration is hostile to the government of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. </span><span>But I'd make three points about this minor controversy and its larger significance.</span></p> \n<h3>1) You might be surprised to learn that Rice actually outranks the Israeli ambassador within the US government</h3> \n<p>In fact, it turns out that Rice is quite senior and that Dermer is not a member of the US government at all! It is Dermer's job to reach out to Rice, not the other way around. The fact that he has not is, to be frank, an insult to the Obama administration. And Rice is correct to be insulted that anyone would imply that it's her job to reach out so a much-lower-ranking official and foreign diplomat, a feeling that comes through in her sarcastic answer.</p> \n<p>The fact that Dermer has not reached out to Rice is a reminder of how much the Netanyahu government is driving the US-Israel discord. The fact that people are blaming Rice for Dermer's slight is a sign of how screwy our standards can be when it comes to the politics of US-Israel relations.</p> \n<h3>2) Rice is also correct to be offended that a foreign diplomat is more engaged with the opposition party than with the sitting government</h3> \n<p>Ever since Netanyahu's May 2011 trip to Washington, when he publicly lectured Obama at a press conference and then gave a speech to Congress slamming the president, his government has been getting awfully involved in domestic US politics. Typically that has meant undermining the Obama administration while cultivating ties with Republicans and conservative donors like Adelson. That's been seen as Netanyahu campaigning for Republicans to unseat the Democrats — an awfully provocative interference in an ally's internal politics — or at least trying to use domestic American politics as a cudgel against Obama.</p> \n<p>So when Rice says that Ambassador Dermer is more interested in meeting Sheldon Adelson than her, what she's observing is that the Israeli government is more interested in undermining the Obama administration than working with it.</p> \n<h3>3) Bad news for Rice: the US does this sort of meddling in foreign politics all the time, and other countries hate it, too</h3> \n<p>American ambassadors are pretty well-known for meeting opposition parties, activists, and civil society groups, and meeting with them often. This is often perceived, not without reason, as working with those groups to the point of meddling. In Egypt, for example, American diplomats cultivated such close ties with the Muslim Brotherhood before it won the presidency that there are still widespread conspiracy theories that the US effectively installed them in power. In Russia, President Vladimir Putin watches the Americans meeting with democracy activists and sees a conspiracy to unseat him.</p> \n<p>And, yes, the US does this in Israel as well: in Israel's 1996 and 1999 elections, the Clinton administration <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/8/4/5967049/obama-gaza-israel-netanyahu-angry"">implicitly signaled its preferred candidates</a>. Netanyahu ran in both elections and he was Clinton's choice in neither. Netanyahu won in '96 but lost office in '99 and perhaps today remembers the impact that foreign involvement can have in a country's political process. This doesn't make Dermer's actions any less undiplomatic — going a year without meeting with Susan Rice is a pretty big slap — but his meetings with Sheldon Adelson are a pretty classic play from the American playbook.</p>",Politics

Scotland let 16-year-olds vote.

Just one municipality lets 16-year-olds vote in local elections: Takoma Park, Maryland. The idea of lowering the voting age is more frequently argued in middle school debates than it is in serious policy discourse.</span></p> \n<p>That's too bad. The evidence suggests it might be worth trying.</p> \n<h3>What Austria and Scotland learned from letting 16-year-olds vote</h3> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""2424920"" alt=""austrians voting"" src=""http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2424920/88276945.0.jpg""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Women in traditional Austrian dress cast their votes during the 2009 EU elections. (Dieter Nagl/AFP via Getty Images)</p> \n<p><span>In 2007, Austria became the first established democracy to lower its voting age for national elections to 16. (People can also vote at 16 in Brazil and Malta, and in local or state-level elections in parts of Switzerland and Germany.)</span></p> \n<p>A study of Austria's expanded electorate found that 16- and 17-year-olds were not less informed than 18-year-olds. Nor were they less willing to participate in politics. And they could pick candidates who represented their own political beliefs just as well as older voters. That addressed several of the common arguments against lowering the voting age: that 16- and 17-year-olds simply aren't ready to vote.</p> \n<p>""Lowering the voting age does not appear to have a negative impact on input legitimacy and the quality of democratic decisions,"" three Austrian researchers <a href=""http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261379412000212"" target=""_blank"">wrote in the journal <i>Electoral Studies</i></a>. ""This means that the potential positive consequences of this reform merit particular consideration and should also be empirically studied.""<span> </span></p> \n<p>Another experiment with a lower voting age in an established democracy happened in Scotland earlier this year, where teenagers as young as 16 were allowed to vote in its historic independence referendum.</p> \n<p>Scotland <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/sep/18/scottish-vote-no-exit-poll-democratic-deficit"" target=""_blank"">didn't run exit polls</a>, so it's impossible to know how many of those 16- and 17-year-olds actually voted, how they voted, or whether their votes turned out to be decisive. But it's revived a campaign to lower the UK's voting age to 16, with political rivals from Scotland's Labour and Conservative Parties praising the energy and commitment of Scotland's teenagers during the referendum.</p> \n<h3>18 is an arbitrary age, too</h3> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""2424950"" alt=""vietnam war protest"" src=""http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2424950/184146575.0.jpg""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">The death of young soldiers in the Vietnam War was an impetus to lower the voting age from 21 to 18. (Anthony Barboza/Getty Images)</p> \n<p><span>When the voting age was lowered from 21 to 18, 18 had a special and unique symbolic resonance: it was when you could be drafted to serve in the armed forces and be injured or die in the Vietnam War. But military conscription ended two years after the voting age was lowered.</span></p> \n<div>Still, because the legal age of adulthood in most states in the US is 18, it seems natural, symmetrical, and logical to let people vote then, too. But it's actually pretty arbitrary, as are most age-related restrictions. You can work (and pay taxes) at age 14, and in some states, you can operate a car with a parent present. In some states, you can drive alone at age 16, and get married with parental consent. On the other hand, you can't drink until you're 21; you can't hold office in the House of Representatives until you're 25, and you have to wait until 35 to be president.</div> \n<div><br></div> \n<div>John Adams knew the voting age was an arbitrary cutoff, <span>as Osita Nwanevu </span><a style=""line-height: 1.5; background-color: #ffffff;"" href=""http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/10/age_of_candidacy_laws_should_be_abolished_why_18_year_olds_should_be_able.html"" target=""_blank"">wrote in Slate last year</a><span>:</span>\n</div> \n<div><br></div> \n<blockquote> \n<p>Age restrictions were never given the lengthy considerations given to property qualifications and restrictions based on citizenship — it was enough for men like John Adams to simply assume that civic competence grew naturally with age. In 1776, Adams delivered a hand-waving defense of Massachusetts' voting age in a letter to James Sullivan, who would later become the state's governor. ""What Reason Should there be, for excluding a Man of Twenty years, Eleven Months and twenty-seven days old, from a Vote when you admit one, who is twenty one?"" he wrote. ""The Reason is, you must fix upon Some Period in Life, when the Understanding and Will of Men in general is fit to be trusted by the Public."" Translation: ""You've gotta pick some age, right?"" One can almost picture him shrugging as he wrote those words.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Laurence Steinberg, a psychologist and expert in adolescence, agrees that 16-year-olds are just as capable as 18-year-olds. He distinguishes between ""cold cognition"" — decisions that you get to think about in advance, such as voting or consenting to a medical procedure — and ""hot cognition,"" decisions made on the fly. Adolescents are impulsive, which makes their hot cognition skills iffy. But they're perfectly capable of cold cognition before they enter the voting booth, he <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-steinberg-lower-voting-age-20141104-story.html"">writes in the Los Angeles Times</a>.</p> \n<h3><span>Why a younger voting age should start at the state level</span></h3> \n<p><img src=""http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2425302/shutterstock_107539820.0.jpg"" alt=""California state capitol"" data-chorus-asset-id=""2425302""></p> \n<p>During the 1960s, the movement to lower the voting age from 21 to 18 started in four states. It then spread nationwide with a constitutional amendment passed in 1971. A handful of states <span>seem like a natural place to experiment with setting the voting age even lower today.</span></p> \n<p>State legislatures set many of the policies that most directly affect 16-year-olds' lives, from whether they're able to drive to how much state funding their schools get to what they'll eventually pay in college tuition. If we're going to experiment with giving older teenagers a voice in politics, it makes sense to start at the state level, where it could make the most difference in their day-to-day existence. For the same reason, allowing younger voters into local school board elections would be a logical step.</p> \n<p>The biggest argument against a younger voting age is that teenagers won't take advantage of it. This could well be true. Voters under 30 are notoriously terrible about showing up to the polls. And despite supporters' arguments that starting voting at 16 will instill a lifelong love of voting, there's little evidence that a lower voting age will increase overall participation rates.</p> \n<p><span>But that's also somewhat beside the point. When it comes to who's allowed to vote, it makes sense to err on the side of more democracy, not less. In lowering the voting age, the question shouldn't be ""why"" — it should be ""why not?""</span></p>",Politics

But a governor often isn't enough — you need a legislature willing to accept the Medicaid expansion, too.

If you think Obamacare is a rolling catastrophe, then the election is a chance to keep it from infecting more states.</p> \n<p>Either way, the upshot is clear: you should go vote.</p> \n<h3>2) Raises for 680,000 workers</h3> \n<p><img src=""http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2425006/casselman-feature-minwage-1.0.png"" alt=""min wage"" data-chorus-asset-id=""2425006""> <a></a></p> \n<p class=""caption""><a href=""http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/election-day-could-bring-raises-to-680000-low-wage-workers/"">538</a><a></a></p> \n<p>Voters in Alaska, Arkansas, Nebraska and South Dakota will consider ballot initiatives to raise their state's minimum wage.

If you believe raising the minimum wage <a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/minimum-wage-explained/does-the-minimum-wage-cause-unemployment"" target=""_blank"">cuts jobs</a> and so, in the end, hurts workers, then a lot of people's jobs are riding on Tuesday's vote.</p> \n<p>Either way, the upshot is clear: you should go vote.</p> \n<h3>3) Four Supreme Court justices are over age 70</h3> \n<p><img src=""http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/673844/105065262.0.jpg"" alt=""Supreme Court"" data-chorus-asset-id=""673844""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">No one here gets carded. (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)</p> \n<p>To use Donald Rumsfeld's immortal coinage, a Supreme Court retirement is one of those ""known unknowns"" that make it impossible to write any election off as inconsequential. Ruth Bader Ginsburg is 81. Antonin Scalia and Anthony Kennedy are both 78. Stephen Breyer is 76. And the Court is divided 5-4 on many contentious issues.</p> \n<p>With a Supreme Court balanced on that knife's edge, every election has the potential to be among the most important in recent American history. If Republicans take control of the Senate <span class=""GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark""><span class=""GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark"">in</span></span> 2014, then they'll have veto power over any nominees President Obama might pick to fill a vacancy, nominees that could reshape the Court. But if Democrats hold the Senate and, say, Antonin Scalia unexpectedly retires, then the 2014 election might end up swinging control of one of America's three branches of government, with untold consequences that will reverberate for decades.</p> \n<p><q class=""center"" aria-hidden=""true""><span>With a 5-4 <span class=""GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark"">Supreme</span> Court, every election has the potential to be among the most important in recent American history</span></q></p> \n<p>Today's Supreme Court is the direct result of George W. Bush's contested election. If Al Gore had won the presidency in 2000 and reelection in 2004, then William Rehnquist and Sandra Day O'Connor would likely have been replaced by liberal nominees, and Supreme Court jurisprudence in the years since would have been very different.</p> \n<p>The irony, of course, is that people said the 2000 election was one of the least important in history, too.</p> \n<h3>4) 6,057 of the country's 7,383 state legislative seats are on the ballot</h3> \n<p>And state legislative seats are way more important than most people realize. I'm just going to outsource this one to John Oliver.</p> \n<p><iframe width=""640"" height=""360"" frameborder=""0"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/aIMgfBZrrZ8""></iframe></p> \n<p>According to <a href=""http://ballotpedia.org/State_legislative_elections,_2014"" target=""_blank"">Ballotpedia</a>, 87 of the 99 state legislative chambers are holding elections today. All in all, there are 6,057 of the country's 7,383 state legislative seats are on the ballot today.</p> \n<h3>5) It might let you get high legally</h3> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""2425070"" alt=""marijuana smoking"" src=""http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2425070/103280233.0.jpg""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">(Sean Gallup/Getty Images)</p> \n<p>Voters in Alaska, Florida, Oregon and Washington, DC, will decide if they want to join Colorado and Washington in legalizing marijuana.</p> \n<p>The different initiatives vary slightly. As German Lopez <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/10/20/6953771/weed-legalization-alaska-florida-oregon-washington-dc-vote"" target=""_blank"">reports</a>, Alaska's Ballot Measure 2 would let adults 21 and <span class=""GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark"">older possess</span> up to one ounce of pot and maintain six marijuana plants, while taxing marijuana at $50 per ounce. Oregon's ballot measure would let adults 21 and older hold eight ounces and four plants, and tax marijuana at $35 an ounce. <span class=""GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark"">D.C.'s initiative</span> would let adults 21 and older hold two ounces and six plants, but because D.C. <span class=""GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark"">can't</span> set its own budget rules, there would be no tax.</p> \n<p>Florida's initiative, meanwhile, would legalize medical marijuana, but not recreational marijuana.</p> \n<h3>6) The House and the Senate are up for grabs</h3> \n<p><img src=""http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2406246/465639243.0.jpg"" alt=""capitol cones"" data-chorus-asset-id=""2406246""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Mark Wilson/Getty Images</p> \n<p>Elections aren't much of a mystery these days. We have so much polling and early voting information and historical data that the set of outcomes we even imagine to be possible is pretty limited.</p> \n<p>But the actual set of possible outcomes isn't limited at all. Every House seat is open. So too are 36 Senate seats. It's true that the House isn't likely to change hands. But if voter turnout was 80 percent rather than 40 percent, it certainly could. We know what's likely to happen, but that doesn't mean we know what will happen.</p> \n<p><q class=""center"" aria-hidden=""true""><span>It all depends on who actually shows up to vote</span></q></p> \n<p>I'm as guilty of this as anyone, but there's a tendency to let expectations congeal into predictions, and predictions be mistaken for facts. But the facts of the election are that Congress — the most powerful branch of the federal government by far — is completely up for grabs. It all depends on who actually shows up to vote. And who shows up to vote depends, in part, on whether people realize that the election is important, and that their vote matters.</p> \n<h3>7) Your vote matters more in midterm elections than presidential elections</h3> \n<p>There's an irony to the fact that so many more people turn out to vote for president than turn out for midterms: the higher turnout <span class=""GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark"">of</span> presidential elections means an individual vote is worth more in midterm elections. That's true not just for the races with a national component, like <span class=""GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark"">Senate</span>, but for state and local races, which aren't buoyed by presidential turnout.</p> \n<p>So don't think of midterm elections as less exciting than presidential elections. Think of them as the elections where you have more of a voice.</p> \n<h3>8) 2017's majorities will be built on the 2014 election</h3> \n<p>The crucial majorities that pass legislation are built over many elections. A seat Democrats lose in Colorado in 2014 might be the vote that President Hillary Clinton needed to pass universal pre-k in 2017. A seat <span class=""GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark"">Republicans</span> <span class=""GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark"">lose</span> in Kansas might be the seat President Mike Pence needed to secure a congressional majority and pass Rep. Paul Ryan's budget.</p> \n<p><q class=""center"" aria-hidden=""true""><span>If Democrats had won one less seat in 2006, Obamacare never would have passed.</span></q></p> \n<p>That's what happened during Obama's first two years, certainly. It was the 2006 Democratic wave that got Democrats the temporary 60-vote majority that let them pass Obamacare in 2010. If Democrats had won one less seat in 2006, it's likely that Obamacare never would have passed.</p> \n<p>The 2014 election, in other words, may not lead to much action in 2015, but it could prove decisive in 2017. You never know.</p> \n<h3>9) If you don't vote, you can't fucking complain</h3> \n<p><img src=""http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2425520/g8zxezo60e-ikjp2ofkoxw.0.png"" alt=""Gallup congressional approval"" data-chorus-asset-id=""2425520""></p> \n<p class=""caption""><a href=""http://www.gallup.com/poll/178607/weeks-elections-congressional-approval-low.aspx"">Gallup</a></p> \n<p>Whining about Washington is pretty much a national pastime these days.

You like how your state government is working. You like how your local government is working. But you also don't much care if it changes.</p> \n<p>Which is to say, if you're basically satisfied with how things are going, and also don't think you'll care much if they sharply reverse direction, then by all means, stay home.

Facebookâ€™s â€œI Votedâ€ sticker was a secret experiment on its users,http://www.vox.com/2014/11/4/7154641/midterm-elections-2014-voted-facebook-friends-vote-polls,Facebook is trying to peer-pressure you into voting.,"<p>If you live in the US and logged into Facebook this morning, you probably saw something like this:</p> \n<p><img src=""http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2426380/Screen_Shot_2014-11-04_at_10.36.52_AM.0.png"" alt=""Facebook I voted button"" data-chorus-asset-id=""2426380""></p> \n<p>You might think it's just a decorative gimmick — a cute electronic version of the ""I Voted"" sticker you get upon exiting the polling station. And Facebook says it's just doing its civic duty by encouraging its users to vote.</p> \n<p>But there's a lot more to it than that, as <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2014/10/can-voting-facebook-button-improve-voter-turnout"">Mother Jones reported last Friday</a>. For the last few elections, Facebook has been running a series of quiet, but massive, experiments on you to see if it can make you more likely to vote. And it looks like their encouragements are working.</p> \n<h3>The Facebook ""I Voted"" sticker might be boosting voter turnout</h3> \n<p>Voter turnout in <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/11/3/7150951/midterm-election-2014-live-updates-results-polls-predictions-2014"" target=""_blank"">midterm elections</a>, like this year's, is typically a lot lower than turnout in presidential elections. But the 2010 midterm elections saw many more voters than had shown up for the previous midterms, in 2006. According to a study done by Facebook scientists and published in <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://fowler.ucsd.edu/massive_turnout.pdf"">Nature<i>, </i></a>that ""I Voted"" sticker on Facebook could be part of the reason.</p> \n<p>Facebook offered the ""I Voted"" sticker to most of its users in 2010 — but not all of them. A few hundred thousand users just didn't see any sticker at all, and a few hundred thousand more got the sticker but no information about whether their friends had clicked it.</p> \n<p>It turns out that people were a little more likely to vote — and definitely more likely to tell Facebook they'd voted — if they saw their friends had voted too. Eighteen percent of people who <i>didn't </i>see a list of friends who'd voted clicked on the ""I Voted"" sticker; 20 percent of people who did see the list of friends clicked on it. And users who saw both the sticker and the list of friends were slightly more likely <span>(about 0.6 percent)</span><span> to actually go to the polls than users who didn't see anything.</span></p> \n<p><q class=""center"" aria-hidden=""true"">the sticker — and the peer pressure — caused 340,000 more people to vote </q></p> \n<p>According to the Facebook scientists, the sticker — and the peer pressure — caused 340,000 more people to vote in the 2010 midterms. Their study claims that ""a single message on Facebook"" was a major factor in increased turnout from 2010.</p> \n<p>Facebook's not running any voter-button experiments in 2014. But if turnout's down this year, despite the Facebook stickers, it might be harder for Facebook to take credit.</p> \n<h3>Pumping more politics into the News Feed</h3> \n<p>In 2012, Facebook tried a slightly different experiment, starting way before Election Day.</p> \n<p>A few months before the election, Facebook shuffled the way stories appeared on about 2 million people's feeds. Instead of, say, engagements and baby photos automatically floating to the top of the page, the top slots went to news articles being shared by friends. Because of the timing, a lot of those news articles were about the 2012 campaign.</p> \n<p>Facebook's research says that shuffle made a big difference — especially for occasional users who might not scroll down their feeds. After the election, the occasional Facebookers who'd seen more news in their feeds said they paid more attention to government than the ones who'd seen less. And while 64 percent of occasional users with normal feeds said they'd voted in the 2012 election, 67 percent of users with news-boosted feeds said they had.</p> \n<h3>Is manipulating voters a good thing?</h3> \n<p>There are serious caveats to the 2012 study, because self-reporting isn't always accurate. But if Facebook really has been able to boost turnout in the last two national elections, it wouldn't be the first time it's succeeded at manipulating users' behavior. Earlier this year, Facebook got into a lot of trouble for <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.pnas.org/content/111/24/8788.full"">revealing</a><b> </b>it had <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/6/30/5856938/the-facebook-study-wasnt-just-creepy-it-was-bad-research"" target=""_blank"">attempted</a> to experiment on what emotions showed up in people's news feeds, and whether the emotions they saw affected what they posted themselves.</p> \n<p>It seems less controversial for Facebook to try to get users to vote than it does for Facebook to try to make users happy or sad. That's especially true because — unlike Facebook's voter engagement data — analysts assume Facebook's work with emotions has the ultimate goal of making users happy or sad <i>about a particular advertiser or product. </i>(Facebook emphasizes that they don't use voting data for advertising, or share it with advertisers.)</p> \n<p><i></i>But <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/7/3/5865279/the-truth-about-facebook"">as Nilay Patel pointed out for Vox this summer</a>, Facebook's behavior isn't that different from ads telling us what to buy or who to vote for:</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>Taco Bell pays BuzzFeed to create shareable advertising, and then pays Facebook to tweak the News Feed to make sure that advertising shows up when it's shared. And since the point of advertising is to create an emotional relationship between you and a product, it's not at all unfair to say that Taco Bell's paying Facebook to manipulate your emotions by changing the News Feed.</p> \n<p>But no one's mad about Taco Bell buying ads or promoted posts in Facebook's News Feed, even though ads are designed to change our emotions. (Just wait until election season really heats up.) What we're mad about is the idea of Facebook having so much power we don't understand - a power that feels completely unchecked when it's described as ""manipulating our emotions."" Advertisers paying to change our feelings about products feels clean and familiar; Facebook screwing with your mind just to see what happens feels like playing god. But in the grand scheme of the internet economy, Facebook running a badly-designed test on a tiny fraction of its billion and a half users for one week in 2012 is virtually meaningless when the company is building an entire business around #brand #engagement with #audiences every other day of the year.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p><em>Watch: The midterm elections, explained in 8 bits</em> <!-- CHORUS_VIDEO_EMBED ChorusVideo:57244 --></p> \n<hr> \n<p><b>UPDATE/CORRECTION: </b>Facebook has confirmed that they're not using the voting button in any user experiments this year; the headline of this piece has been corrected to reflect that, and the text of the piece has been clarified.

Meet Tom Cotton: Arkansas's next Senator and Rand Paul's worst nightmare,http://www.vox.com/2014/11/5/7154855/tom-cotton-rand-paul,Arkansas' new Senator-elect is the young face of Republican hawkery. He and Rand Paul are not going to get along.,"<p>Arkansas elected Republican Rep. Tom Cotton to the Senate on Tuesday, sending incumbent Mark Pryor packing.

Rand Paul just gave one of the most important foreign policy speeches in decades</a>)</p> \n<p>Cotton, you see, is the golden child of the Republican party's hawkish establishment. He still calls the 2003 Iraq invasion a ""just and noble"" war. He's young — just 37 — and fervently backed by some of the most influential conservative figures in the nation. His Senate victory makes him a serious candidate for an even higher office some day. But even before then, his ascent could represent a larger movement in his party's foreign policy.</p> \n<p>This sets him on a collision course with the GOP's other leading young voice on foreign policy: Sen. Rand Paul. One of Paul's top priorities is moving the Republican Party away from George W. Bush's neoconservatism; one of Cotton's is pulling the party back towards it. And given the slate of immediate foreign policy issues facing the Senate, the two are likely to be at odds sooner rather than later.</p> \n<h3><span>Cotton's hawkishness is his defining political trait</span></h3> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""2427588"" alt=""Tom Cotton "" src=""http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2427588/458200724.0.jpg""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Cotton at a campaign event. (Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)</p> \n<p>Like much of the GOP class of 2014, Cotton is extremely conservative on domestic policy. He scored a 92 on the influential <a href=""http://www.clubforgrowth.org/scorecards/?chamber=0&amp;scyear=2013"" target=""_blank"">Club for Growth</a>'s House scorecard last year, a rough approximation of a member's conservatism measured by their votes on economic legislation. That 92 puts him in the top 5 percent of most conservative House members.</p> \n<p>But it's foreign policy where Cotton really distinguishes himself from the pack.

(Jessica McGowan/Getty Images)</p> \n<p>If Senator Cotton will be the avatar for a new generation of neoconservatives, then Rand Paul seems bound to quickly become his greatest foe within the party.</p> \n<p>Paul's late October <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/10/24/7053561/rand-paul-foreign-policy-speech"" target=""_blank"">speech on world politics</a>, widely understood to be a preview for his 2016 foreign policy platform, took a number of undisguised shots at people with Cotton's views. ""We will not instigate war,"" Paul <a href=""http://nationalinterest.org/feature/rand-paul-the-case-conservative-realism-11544?page=show"" target=""_blank"">said</a>. ""<span>Americans yearn for leadership and for strength, but they don't yearn for war.""<br></span></p> \n<p>While Paul wants to put tight legal limits on America's targeted killing program, for example, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIjB4gpew2Y"" target=""_blank"">Cotton supports expanding the drone war</a>. While Paul <a href=""http://reason.com/archives/2014/10/28/rand-paul-conservative-realist/print"" target=""_blank"">opposes</a> getting more involved in the wars in Syria and Iraq, Cotton is <a href=""http://online.wsj.com/articles/tom-cotton-mark-pryor-race-tests-appetite-for-active-military-1413241941"" target=""_blank"">open to deploying ground troops</a> to fight ISIS. On essentially every major issue of war and peace facing the country, Cotton and Paul's instincts run opposite ways.</p> \n<p>The contrast even extends to their styles and backgrounds. Paul acts <a href=""http://www.buzzfeed.com/rosiegray/rand-paul-is-not-the-most-interesting-man-in-politics"" target=""_blank"">like an everyman</a>; Cotton boasts two Harvard degrees. Paul <a href=""https://twitter.com/Olivianuzzi/status/525443029952651264"" target=""_blank"">jokes</a> about being an ophthalmologist dabbling in foreign policy; Cotton talks up his military career.</p> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""2427600"" alt=""Tom Cotton army"" src=""http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2427600/140304-cotton-7p_1fc2c3ebd6ee8ceb7b5f122896e8ebc4.0.jpg""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Cotton in uniform. (Tom Cotton)</p> \n<p>These differences are more than just stylistic. Paul's views on foreign policy are idiosyncratic; he's the heir to a <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/10/28/7022003/rand-paul-non-interventionism-daniel-mccarthy"" target=""_blank"">long and diffuse tradition of grassroots non-interventionism on the American right</a>, but is trying to invent a new version of the doctrine that can appeal to the American mainstream.</p> \n<p>Cotton, meanwhile, studied the neoconservative icon Leo Strauss at Harvard. Cotton's Strauss-inflected senior thesis amounts to an extended defense of the theory that intellectually gifted elites should rule. ""Such men rise from the people through a process of self-selection since politics is a dirty business that discourages all but the most ambitious,"" he writes. Now, that sentence was intended merely as a description of the views of some American founders. But according to Ball, the entire thesis is dedicated to defending precisely their ideas about the superiority of public officeholders.</p> \n<p><span>Paul, on the other hand, is a populist, including in foreign policy, attempting to harness public discontent with America's last decade of war for his campaign to remake the Republican party. Cotton, meanwhile, represents the Republican elite's best face: a smart, polished, consummately connected advocate for America's national security state. And now the two will be facing off on the Senate floor.</span></p> \n<h3><span>They're about to come to blows over Iran and ISIS</span></h3> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""2404800"" alt=""Obama Rouhani phone call"" src=""http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2404800/182034992.0.jpg""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Obama on the phone with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani. (Pete Souza/White House/Getty Images)</p> \n<p>It shouldn't take very long for the latent Paul-Cotton tension to become overt political conflict. Immediately after the midterm elections, the Senate is going to be forced to address two major foreign policy issues. Both will likely still be unresolved by the time that Cotton takes office in January.</p> \n<p>November 24 is the <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/10/15/us-iran-nuclear-idUSKCN0I40VX20141015"">latest deadline</a> for reaching a deal in the ongoing negotiations between the United States and Iran over Iran's nuclear program. The two countries will likely miss the deadline, but either way Iran's nuclear program will likely be a defining foreign policy issue in Obama's second term.</p> \n<p>Congress has a <a href=""http://www.jpost.com/Arab-Israeli-Conflict/Analysis-US-midterms-and-the-Iran-talks-dynamic-380606"" target=""_blank"">huge role to play on Iran</a>. The American negotiating position is that, if Iran agrees to sufficiently limit its nuclear development, the United States will lift economic sanctions and move towards more normal diplomatic relations. But Iran sanctions are enshrined in legislation. If Congress wants, it can prevent Obama from relaxing sanctions. It can even impose new sanctions while Obama is negotiating, potentially torpedoing the talks by convincing Iranians that the president can't deliver on sanctions relief.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""right"">There's no doubt that the two will come to blows in a high-profile way</q></p> \n<p>Naturally, Cotton and Paul have opposing views here. Paul supports a negotiated solution to the Iran crisis. Cotton said that the interim agreement with Iran reached last fall was <a href=""http://cotton.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/cotton-statement-on-iran-nuclear-agreement"" target=""_blank"">worse than Munich</a>.</p> \n<p>The question of what to do about ISIS will also put Paul and Cotton at odds. House Speaker Boehner <a href=""http://www.politico.com/story/2014/09/congress-isil-vote-lame-duck-111316.html"" target=""_blank"">wants</a> to save a vote on giving legal authorization for Obama's military campaign against the group until after the lame duck session — that is, after Cotton takes up his position in the Senate. That means that, even if the Senate votes on the issue sooner, the Republican-controlled Senate will likely have to revisit authorization in January.</p> \n<p>In this debate, Paul will likely push for the most limited possible language, while Cotton <a href=""http://online.wsj.com/articles/tom-cotton-mark-pryor-race-tests-appetite-for-active-military-1413241941"" target=""_blank"">will be pressing</a> to give the executive as much leeway to wage war as possible. Both care about this issue, care about getting some foreign policy profile, and think about US policy toward ISIS very differently.</p> \n<p>And there will be other issues. Funding for Syrian rebels, the Ukraine crisis, and NSA spying could all conceivably come to the front of the national security docket. Each one will likely see Paul and Cotton on opposite sides, attempting to sway their fellow Senators and the GOP base to their point of view.</p> \n<h3>The stakes: the GOP's foreign policy soul</h3> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""2388170"" alt=""rand paul john mccain"" src=""http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2388170/129163093.0.jpg""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Shaaaaaaaade. (Brendan Hoffman/Getty Images)</p> \n<p>For the next two years, Paul will be laying the groundwork for his 2016 run for president. In order to do that, he'll need to persuade Republican elites — donors, media figures, political operatives, and the like — that he can and should win. This means selling them on his foreign policy vision.</p> \n<p>Cotton may well prove one of the biggest obstacles to Paul's campaign. At the same time that Paul is attempting to push the party in a non-interventionist direction, or at least sell the party on letting him possibly lead them that way, Cotton will be tugging as hard as he can in the other direction. Either overtly or implicitly, his efforts will work against Paul's shadow campaign. The more interventionist the GOP center of gravity is, the more danger Paul faces in the so-called ""<a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/4/8/5593294/why-rand-paul-isnt-the-gop-presidential-frontrunner"" target=""_blank"">shadow primary</a>"" where elites decide whom they ought to support.</p> \n<p>So this is about Paul's bid for the presidency — and, by extension, the GOP's foreign policy soul. If Paul wins the primary, then the GOP and its elected officials will have to line up behind him. That will mean defending his foreign policy against Democrats, who will likely blast Paul from an interventionist point of view, especially if Hillary Clinton is the Democratic candidate. The entire Republican center of gravity on foreign policy could shift.</p> \n<p>Republicans such as Cotton will be much less welcome in that GOP. So they'll fight Paul tooth and nail to make sure it won't happen. Cotton's ascension to the Senate, then, opens one more very prominent front in the Republican civil war.</p>",Politics

""If Republicans take the Senate tonight, neither side will have held it for more than eight consecutive years since 1980, a period of volatility unlike anything since the late 19th century,"" Brownstein writes.</p> \n<p>And the boom-and-bust cycle is likely to happen even quicker this time. As of now, it looks like Democrats will be defending 10 Senate seats to the GOP's 24 in the 2016 election, and doing it amid the more favorable demographics of a presidential election.

The 5 biggest myths about the 2014 election,http://www.vox.com/2014/11/5/7156913/5-myths-2014,You'll hear these a lot. Too bad they're wrong.,"<p>There are two things that come out of elections: results and narratives.</p> \n<p>The results are clear. Democrats got destroyed. But the narrative — the ""why"" of the election — is contested. Did Democrats lose the Senate because liberalism is a bankrupt ideology or because President Obama is a bad communicator or because voters simply develop some mystical loathing of the majority party in the sixth year of a presidency?</p> \n<p>This seems like a dumb debate — results are knowable, so who cares about narratives? — but it actually matters. Politicians act based on what they believe the lessons of the last election were. And because the narratives end up actually being important, the different sides fight to secure the narratives that are friendliest to their hopes. But a lot of the narratives are wrong. Not wrong in the sense of being a lie — they all have a kernel of truth — but wrong in the sense that they don't really explain what happened Tuesday night.</p> \n<p>Here are five of the explanations you'll hear most often — and should be most skeptical of.</p> \n<h3>1) The Democratic coalition just doesn't do midterms</h3> \n<p><img src=""http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2431166/race_of_voters_by_election_cycle.0.0.png"" alt=""race_of_voters_by_election_cycle.0.0.png"" data-chorus-asset-id=""2431166""></p> \n<p><b>What's the argument? </b>The electorate in midterm elections is older and whiter than it is in presidential elections, and that gives Republicans a structural advantage. As Ron Brownstein <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.nationaljournal.com/political-connections/the-tectonic-plates-of-2014-20141103"">wrote</a>, ""the modern Democratic coalition is a boom-and-bust coalition that depends heavily on minorities and young people who turn out much less regularly in midterm than presidential elections."" A lot of Democrats use this fact to explain away their weak performance in recent midterms.</p> \n<p><b>Why is it wrong? </b>The problem here is that the excuse is, itself, just a restatement of the problem. A party that can't turn its voters out for midterm elections has a huge problem. Congress matters. It comes first in the Constitution. It decides, for the most part, whether the president will actually get anything done. A party with a coalition that only really turns out in presidential years is a party that only has half of a coalition.</p> \n<p>Moreover, it's not as if Democrats never win midterm elections. They swept the board in 2006, for instance — and, by most any measure, the country's demographics have become more favorable for Democrats in the intervening eight years. The Democratic boom-and-bust cycle doesn't explain away the problem the party had in this election. It <i>is </i>the problem.</p> \n<h3>2) The election was a referendum on liberalism</h3> \n<p><img src=""http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2427608/hyper-liberalism.0.jpg"" alt=""hyper-liberalism.0.jpg"" data-chorus-asset-id=""2427608""></p> \n<p><b>What's the argument?</b> The logic basically goes like this: the election is a referendum on Obama. Obama is a liberal. The election is a referendum on liberalism. And liberalism lost.</p> \n<p><b>Why is it wrong? </b>Well, for one thing, Obama hasn't passed many major bills — liberal or otherwise — since the 2012 election. The most significant legislative accomplishment since the election was the compromise legislation heading off the fiscal cliff — and it's hard to call a deal <a href=""http://www.politico.com/story/2013/01/grover-norquist-cliff-plan-ok-with-pledge-85658.html"" target=""_blank"">endorsed</a> by Grover Norquist hyperliberal.</p> \n<p>But the clearer rebuttal comes directly from the polls. As Zachary Goldfarb <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2014/11/04/americans-will-to-vote-for-republicans-even-though-they-disagree-with-them-on-everything/"" target=""_blank"">writes</a>, voters have ""fallen out with Obama, but on the biggest issues facing Congress, they still agree with Democrats on ... almost everything. That includes issues like raising the minimum wage, making the rich pay more in taxes, letting illegal immigrants stay in the United States, taking action to stem global warming, legalizing same sex marriage and fixing the Affordable Care Act rather than repealing it."" Here's his graph:</p> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""2427674"" alt=""voters agree democrats"" src=""http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2427674/voters_agree_democrats_chart.0.jpg""></p> \n<p class=""caption""><a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2014/11/04/americans-will-to-vote-for-republicans-even-though-they-disagree-with-them-on-everything/"">Zachary Goldfarb/Washington Post</a></p> \n<p>The fate of the ballot initiatives reflected those polls. The personhood ballot initiatives lost in Colorado and North Dakota. Marijuana was legalized in D.C., Oregon, and Alaska. The minimum wage was raised in Arkansas, Illinois, and Nebraska (though the Illinois initiative will still require ratification from the legislature). Washington state expanded background checks on guns. ""So voters want a higher minimum wage, legal pot, abortion access and GOP representation,"" <a href=""https://twitter.com/bencasselman/status/529848264204767232"" target=""_blank"">tweeted</a> FiveThirtyEight's Ben Casselman. ""Ok then.""</p> \n<h3>3) The 2014 wipeout just reflects a bad Senate map for Democrats</h3> \n<p><img src=""http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2426018/Slide12-624x468.0.jpg"" alt=""Slide12-624x468.0.jpg"" data-chorus-asset-id=""2426018""></p> \n<p><b>What's the argument? </b>The Senate map was terrible for Democrats. As the above map, created by the New Republic's Jonathan Cohn, <a href=""http://www.newrepublic.com/article/120100/2014-midterm-races-conservative-red-states-skewing-results"" target=""_blank"">shows</a>, if the 2012 election had taken place only in the states voting for Senate on Tuesday, Mitt Romney would have won the electoral college 165-130.  So of course Democrats lost the 2014 election. The game was rigged.</p> \n<p><b>Why is it wrong? </b>The House results show the problem. There, Democrats were competing in every state, and they still lost badly. If Democrats had gained ground in the House but lost in the Senate it would be easy to blame the map. But they lost in both chambers.</p> \n<p>And then you get to the gubernatorial races. Democrats lost governor races in Illinois, Maryland, Maine, and Massachusetts. You really can't blame losing elections in Illinois, Maryland, Maine, and Massachusetts on the innate conservatism of those states. Democrats were rejected in blue and red states alike.</p> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""2431154"" alt=""Obama job approval RCP"" src=""http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2431154/obama_job_approval.0.jpg""></p> \n<p class=""caption""><a href=""http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/other/president_obama_job_approval-1044.html"">Real Clear Politics</a></p> \n<p>And, of course, there are direct measures of the Democratic Party's problems, too. Obama's approval ratings have been routinely 5-10 points beneath his 2012 approval ratings pretty much all year. The bottom line is the Democratic Party's standardbearer isn't popular.</p> \n<h3>4) This was an anti-incumbent wave, not an anti-Democratic one</h3> \n<p><img src=""http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2431168/166077808.0.jpg"" alt=""Obama somber"" data-chorus-asset-id=""2431168""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Spencer Platt/Getty Images</p> \n<p><b>What's the argument?</b> Prior to the election, there were a series of polls showing that anti-incumbent sentiments were at their highest levels in recent history. ""About two-thirds (68%) of registered voters said last month that they don't want to see most House members re-elected and about a third (35%) don't want to see their own representative returned to office,"" reported <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/11/04/6-facts-about-the-electorate-on-midterm-day/"">Pew</a>. ""In the 2006 and 2010 midterms, about half of voters said they wanted to see most members of Congress defeated."" Meanwhile, the Democratic Party was still viewed more favorably by voters than the Republican Party:</p> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""2416760"" alt=""Dem Rep favorable 1"" src=""http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2416760/dem_rep_favorable.0.jpg""></p> \n<p class=""caption""><a href=""http://www.people-press.org/2014/10/23/as-midterms-near-gop-leads-on-key-issues-democrats-have-a-more-positive-image/"">Pew</a></p> \n<p>So one narrative going into the election was that this wasn't about Democrats at all — voters just hated everyone. But since there were more Democrats up for reelection in the Senate, the anti-incumbent wave would end up hurting Democrats the most.</p> \n<p><b>Why was it wrong?</b> Because incumbents didn't lose. Democratic incumbents lost.</p> \n<p>The House tells the tale. Going into the election, there were more Republicans in the House than Democrats by a 233-199 margin. So an anti-incumbent wave should have boosted Democrats. Instead, Republicans added to their already considerable margins. At this point, Republicans are up to 244 seats — and there are a number of races that haven't yet been called.</p> \n<p>You can see it on the state level, too. As Reid Wilson writes at the Washington Post, ""Before Election Day, the GOP controlled 59 of 98 partisan legislative chambers across the country. On Tuesday, preliminary results showed Republicans had won control of both the Nevada Assembly and Senate, the Minnesota House, the New Mexico House, the Maine House, the West Virginia House and the New Hampshire House. That would give the party control of 66 chambers, four more than their previous record in the modern era, set after special elections in 2011 and 2012."" Again, that's not what you would expect from an anti-incumbent wave.</p> \n<h3>5) This means bipartisanship is back!</h3> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""648518"" alt=""Boehner Obama"" src=""http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/assets/4742366/119868648.jpg""></p> \n<p class=""caption"" style=""text-align: start;"">Jewel Samad/AFP/Getty</p> \n<p><b>What's the argument?</b> There are a lot of people in Washington who yearn for a return to bipartisan dealmaking and look hard for glimmers of hope in any political outcome, no matter how contrary. The Wall Street Journal's Gerald Seib, for instance, <a href=""http://online.wsj.com/articles/why-loss-of-senate-would-carry-silver-linings-for-obama-1412612904"" target=""_blank"">writes</a> that ""full GOP control of Congress might well shift Republicans' focus from stopping him to making things happen.""</p> \n<p>The basic idea is that Republicans, looking towards 2016 and finally holding the reins in the House and Senate, will decide they need to get right with younger, more diverse electorate that increasingly dominates presidential elections — and, in order to do that, they'll cut some of the deals they've been rejecting for the last few years. The result is that Obama will actually find it easier to compromise with a Republican Congress than a divided one.</p> \n<p>There's another version of this argument being made, among others, by <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2014/10/mcconnell-to-restore-bipartisanship-to-senate.html?mid=rss"">Mitch McConnell</a>, which holds that the breakdown in bipartisanship in the Senate is mostly the fault of Harry Reid's management style, and McConnell will run such a clean, open process that comity will return on its own.</p> \n<p><b>What's their interest in arguing it?</b> It is pretty hard to get up every day and cover endless gridlock in Congress. A lot of political reporters and pundits are optimists and are looking for ways in which things might get better. The same goes for members of Congress: they don't much enjoy being hated by the country and having absolutely no serious accomplishments to their name, and they also like to imagine that change is just around the corner.</p> \n<p><b>Why is it wrong? </b>The core problem here is the House, not the Senate. As Jonathan Chait <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2014/10/theres-1-thing-at-stake-in-the-senate-race.html?mid=rss"">writes</a>, ""The legislative dynamics in Washington are very simple. Gridlock exists because Obama and House Republicans cannot agree on legislation. If Obama and the House could agree on legislation, their deal would be approved by a Democratic-controlled Senate or by a Republican-controlled Senate. There are no plausible circumstances in which the Senate would block a deal struck between the House and Obama, because, whichever party controls the Senate, its ideological center will sit comfortably inside in the enormous space between Obama and the House Republicans.""</p> \n<h3>So what's right?</h3> \n<p>It's easy to say elections are complicated and elegant explanations inevitably oversimplify. So what's the right narrative of the 2014 election?</p> \n<p>The answer — to be a bad pundit for a moment — is I'm not really sure. And nor is anyone else. My guess is there is no one narrative that really works. We're in a period of extreme volatility in American politics. The 2012 election — where Democrats dominated at every level — was only two years ago. The Republican wave of the 2010 election was only two years before that. The massive Democratic gains in the 2008 election were only two years before that. And the massive Democratic gains in the 2006 midterm were only two years before that.</p> \n<p>The last five elections, taken together, wreck almost every clean story you might try to wrap around them. They show an electorate that veers hard and quickly between left and right and back again — shredding any efforts one might make to draw deep ideological conclusions from a single campaign. They show that Democrats can, in the right circumstances, win midterm elections. They show that incumbents can win presidential campaigns. They show an electorate that seems to be searching for something it cannot find.</p>",Politics

But they don't want to have any influence on who ends up voting — <b>they don't want anyone deciding not to vote because they've already seen what the exit polls say</b>, and they don't think their vote will matter. (There's some evidence that this happened back in 1980, when some outlets projected that Ronald Reagan would win the presidential election before polls closed on the West Coast.)</p> \n<p>In some countries, like the United Kingdom, it's actually illegal for any media outlet to report exit poll results before the polls close.

Lindsey Graham's big win deserves much more attention than it's gotten,http://www.vox.com/2014/11/4/7158197/lindsey-graham-2014,How Lindsey Graham beat the Tea Party.,"<p>In 2010, the Tea Party began picking off Republican members of Congress it considered insufficiently conservative. And those primary victories were, properly, treated as huge news. They showed, or seemed to show, how deeply vulnerable Republicans were if they showed even a hint of compromise. The victories seemed to herald a new norm in the Republican Party where no efforts to work across the aisle would be permitted — even by staunch, respected conservatives.</p> \n<p>By the same token, Lindsey Graham's easy ride to reelection in South Carolina tonight should also be big news. In recent years, there's been no Republican legislator who's worked as hard to find compromise as Graham. He was there on immigration reform, which passed the Senate, but he's also been there on a slew of initiatives that didn't pass, and where far fewer Republicans joined the effort. He worked with John Kerry and Joe Lieberman on <a href=""http://grist.org/politics/why-is-environmental-defense-fund-backing-lindsey-graham/"" target=""_blank"">a climate bill</a>, and, early on, with the Obama administration on <a href=""http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0210/33671.html"" target=""_blank"">closing Guantanamo Bay</a>. He even said he would be <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2012/11/25/lindsey-graham-peter-king-break-with-grover-norquist/"" target=""_blank"">willing to break</a> Grover Norquist's anti-tax pledge to strike a big budget deal.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""center""><span>Graham's in a strong enough position that he's even</span><span> talking about running for president in 2016</span></q></p> \n<p>Graham was easily, overwhelmingly reelected. He powered through his June Republican primary with 57 percent of the vote — the runner-up captured only 15 percent. And, tonight, he effortlessly dispatched his Democratic challenger. Graham's in a strong enough position that he's even <a href=""http://www.cnn.com/2014/10/03/politics/graham-rubio-weekly-standard-running-for-president/"" target=""_blank"">talking about</a> running for president in 2016.</p> \n<p>And all this is happening in <i>South Carolina</i>. Graham isn't a Republican from Maine. He's in a conservative state. He's been facing an active Tea Party. And he's still standing. Hell, he's popular.</p> \n<p>Graham's win shows, at the least, that compromise isn't always deadly for Republicans. And a clearer look at the Tea Party's major wins shows that compromise really isn't what sets their victims apart. Eric Cantor certainly didn't run a conciliatory House. Utah Sen. Bob Bennett didn't hand Obama a crucial vote on any major issues. Sen. Richard Lugar wasn't agreeing to raise taxes or pass Obamacare.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""right""><span>Graham's victory suggests that simply being willing to work across the aisle isn't enough to lose your seat</span></q></p> \n<p>The Tea Party has targeted establishment Republicans and, for various reasons, managed to bring a few of them down. But Graham's victory suggests that simply being willing to work across the aisle actually isn't enough to lose your seat, just as Cantor's loss shows that fighting Obama at every turn isn't enough to keep it. Mitt Romney's win in the 2012 Republican primaries arguably shows the same thing — though Romney ran to the right, his record was nevertheless that of a Massachusetts moderate, and he won the GOP's nomination anyway.</p> \n<p>If we're going to make a huge deal out of every Republican who loses a primary challenge and can maybe, if you squint, be thought of as a moderate, than we should also take note of the elected Republicans who have shown themselves willing to compromise and are thriving in today's GOP.</p> \n<p><b>Update:</b> It's also worth noting that Susan Collins, the most moderate Republican in the Senate, also <a href=""http://live.vox.com/midterm-elections-2014-live-blog/#/entry/63771/212000"" target=""_blank"">cruised</a> to reelection tonight. She's from Maine, so it's perhaps not quite as striking as Graham's survival.

Mitch McConnell may be the greatest strategist in contemporary politics,http://www.vox.com/2014/11/4/7158293/mitch-mcconnell-strategist,He beat Obama by breaking Washington.,"<p>Mitch McConnell's <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/11/4/7158087/mitch-mcconnell-kentucky-election-results-2014/in/6914992"" target=""_blank"">reelection tonight</a> wasn't very newsworthy. Polls had shown clearly <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/10/14/6977287/democrats-abandon-alison-lundergan-grimes-kentucky"" target=""_blank"">for weeks</a> that Allison Lundergan Grimes was far behind, and far behind is where you would expect a Democrat to be in Kentucky — especially given President Obama's sagging poll numbers.</p> \n<p>But at a time when McConnell is likely poised to take over as Senate Majority Leader, it's worth taking a moment to acknowledge his political acumen. Not acumen in winning reelection, but acumen in masterminding the Republican comeback after the huge Democratic wave elections in 2006 and 2008. His master plan was simple — hang together and say no. And, by and large, it worked. McConnell is not the most charismatic politician of our time, but he is arguably the sharpest mind in contemporary politics on a strategic level.</p> \n<p>A Republican comeback of this scale was by no means guaranteed. In the winter of 2008-2009, the leaders of the Obama transition effort had a theory as to how things would go and mainstream Washington agreed with them.</p> \n<p>The theory went like this. With large majorities in the House and Senate, it was obvious that lots of Democratic bills would pass. But the White House would be generous and make concessions to Republicans who were willing to leap on the bandwagon. Consequently, incumbent Republicans from states Obama won (Maine, New Hampshire, Ohio, North Carolina, Indiana, Nevada) would be eager to cut deals in which they backed Obama bills in exchange for key concessions. With that process under way, many Republicans who <i>weren't</i> even that vulnerable would be eager to cut deals as well, in search of a piece of the action. As a result, bills would pass the Senate with large 70- to 75-vote majorities, and Obama would be seen as the game-changing president who healed American politics and got things done.</p> \n<p>McConnell's counter plan was to prevent those deals. As McConnell <a href=""http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2011/01/strict-obstructionist/308344/?single_page=true"" target=""_blank"">told Josh Green</a>, the key to eroding Obama's popularity was denying him the sheen of bipartisanship, and that meant keep Republicans united in opposition:</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>""Reporters underestimate how powerful the calendar is,"" says Jim Manley, the former communications director for Harry Reid, the Democratic Senate leader. ""Say you want to break a filibuster. On Monday, you file cloture on a motion to proceed for a vote on Wednesday. Assuming you get it, your opponents are allowed 30 hours of debate post-cloture on the motion to proceed. That takes you to Friday, and doesn't cover amendments. The following Monday you file cloture on the bill itself, vote Wednesday, then 30 more hours of debate, and suddenly two weeks have gone by, for something that's not even controversial."" All of this has slowed Senate business to a crawl.</p> \n<p>""We worked very hard to keep our fingerprints off of these proposals,"" McConnell says. ""Because we thought — correctly, I think — that the only way the American people would know that a great debate was going on was if the measures were not bipartisan. When you hang the ‘bipartisan' tag on something, the perception is that differences have been worked out, and there's a broad agreement that that's the way forward.""</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>To prevent Obama from becoming the hero who fixed Washington, McConnell decided to break it. And it worked. Six years into the affair, we now take it for granted that <i>nothing</i> will pass on a bipartisan basis, <i>no</i> appointment will go through smoothly, and everything the administration tries to get done will take the form of a <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/9/9/5964421/obama-lawsuit-republicans-abuse-of-power"">controversial use of executive power</a>.</p> \n<p>It's been ugly. But in most voters' mind, the ugliness has attached to Obama and, by extension, Democrats. It was a very counterintuitive strategy, but it was well-grounded in the best political science available.

The best evidence yet that Republicans won't do anything on immigration in 2015,http://www.vox.com/2014/11/6/7159267/republicans-congress-immigration-reform-2015,"Or, what we learned from watching Univision on election night","<p>Are Republicans going to use their control of Congress to pass immigration reform in 2015? The short answer is no.</p> \n<p>Here's the best reason to think that they won't: if Republicans <i>were </i>serious about passing immigration reform next year, you'd at least see Republican officials and pundits saying so on Spanish-language media, to reach out to Latino voters. But they're not.</p> \n<p>On the election night edition of Univision's nightly news broadcast (which only lasted an hour, from 11:30pm to 12:30am Eastern, rather than the all-night orgy of English language news networks), immigration was the first issue that came up in any segment. And while everyone on the broadcast agreed that immigration reform needed to happen, no one was willing to say that the Republican Congress would take it on.</p> \n<p style=""font-size: 15.5555562973022px;"">When Univision interviewed an actual Republican member of Congress — newly elected Florida congressman Carlos Curbelo (who beat one-term Democrat Joe Garcia, a big supporter of immigration reform) — he was openly supportive of immigration reform, saying (in Spanish) ""I'm ready to go to Washington to work with Republicans and Democrats to achieve it."" But he didn't make any promises that Republicans are about to take up the issue. In fact, Curbelo wasn't terribly eager to defend his colleagues-to-be: ""We have to be honest. Yes, there are Republicans in the House who've blocked immigration reform. I've criticized them — just like I've criticized the president for using the issue for politics, and failing to keep his promises.""</p> \n<p style=""font-size: 15.5555562973022px;""><iframe frameborder=""0"" src=""http://player.ooyala.com/iframe.html?ec=0xN3BpcTr5FhSEuMk_42awUxaavItVyw&amp;pbid=88e901a4b29c47ba959061faf8813e63&amp;platform=html5"" height=""315"" width=""560""></iframe></p> \n<div><br></div> \n<p>During an <a href=""http://noticias.univision.com/video/540873/2014-11-05/estados-unidos/destino-2014/videos-destino-2014-elecciones-eeuu/inicia-la-carrera-a-la-presidencial/"">analysis segment</a> (also in Spanish), host Jorge Ramos pressed Republican analyst Mercedes Schlapp on whether Republicans would really do immigration reform. Her response began with <i>""Bueno, yo espero que hagan algo"" — </i>""Well, I hope they do something."" Instead of making any predictions about whether the Republican Congress would, she made a point that Univision viewers are very familiar with: that Republicans <i>""tienen que, en alguna manera, buscar solución"" </i>— ""they have to find some sort of solution"" — if they want to compete for the Latino vote in the 2016 presidential election.</p> \n<p>Schlapp did say that the Republican leaders of both chambers of Congress — incoming Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, and Speaker of the House John Boehner — understood the need for Republicans to take up immigration. But Republican leaders in Congress, themselves, haven't been so clear. House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, who's laid out the most detailed agenda so far for a Republican Congress in 2015 and 2016, didn't do anything more than ""(leave) open the possibility"" of some unspecified immigration bill.</p> \n<p>What Republicans on Congress appear to agree on, however, is that any <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/obama-immigration-executive-action-amnesty-congress/obama-immigration-reform-executive-order-amnesty"">executive action by Obama</a> on the issue of immigration is going to ""poison the well"" (<a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/10/2/6885389/obama-immigration-speech-chci-boehner-reform-2015"">in Speaker Boehner's words</a>) for Congress to do anything about it. On Wednesday, incoming Majority Leader McConnell compared executive action on immigration to <a style=""font-size: 15.5555562973022px; line-height: 1.5;"" href=""http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2014/nov/05/us-midterm-elections-republicans-senate#block-545a7abde4b097c67c03e545"" target=""_blank"">""waving a red flag in front of a bull.""</a> If congressional Republicans plan to make an exception to their recalcitrance so that they can get a border-security bill passed, they're certainly not mentioning it. (Bulls aren't known for only busting through particular aisles of china shops.)</p> \n<p>Schlapp mentioned executive action on immigration as a possible obstacle to a Republican immigration bill. Curbelo didn't. But neither of them left Spanish speakers on Tuesday night with any impression that the incoming Republican Congress is committed to immigration reform.</p>",Politics
The polls were skewed â€” against Republicans,http://www.vox.com/2014/11/5/7159837/polling-mistakes-election-2014,Polling averages gave no indication that the GOP wave would be so big.,"<p>This year's Senate polls were more picked-over and modeled than ever before — and their final performance was not impressive. <span>Yes, overall the polls pointed toward a Republican Senate takeover, and correctly predicted the victor of nearly every competitive race. (They missed the Republican victory in North Carolina, and most averages incorrectly gave Greg Orman a slight edge in Kansas.) But the margins they were showing were pretty far off the mark — very far, in several instances:</span></p> \n<p><img src=""http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2430292/Poll_error_11-05.0.png"" alt=""Poll error 11-05"" data-chorus-asset-id=""2430292""></p> \n<p>In the chart, I've showed how far off FiveThirtyEight's projected margins were, for simplicity.

They were way off in deep-red states like Kansas, where independent Orman didn't even come close to winning despite leading most recent polls, and Arkansas, where Sen. Mark Pryor ended up losing by 17 percentage points.</p> \n<p>Yet polls similarly underestimated Republican performance in purple states like Virginia —which was far more close than <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://dailycaller.com/2014/10/30/exclusive-poll-shows-ed-gillespie-down-just-4-points-in-virginia/"">practically </a><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://twitter.com/BillKristol/status/529096453000822785"">anyone</a> expected, though Democrat Mark Warner seems to have barely managed to hang on.

The midterm elections proved that Democrats arenâ€™t alienating Jews on Israel,http://www.vox.com/2014/11/5/7160253/midterms-jews-israel,It turns out the most salient point of the American Jewish approach to politics isn't pro-Israel sentiment or greater concerns about terrorism. It's that they're highly partisan Democrats.,"<p>When the newly elected Congress turns its focus foreign policy, the conversation will surely center around the Middle East. President Obama's team is working hard to broker a nuclear deal with Iran, continuing its campaign to destroy ISIS, and trying to manage the Israel-Palestine conflict. These are all issues on which the new Congress and the American public have strong views. Which is why a <a href=""http://2014.jstreet.org/"" target=""_blank"">new poll</a> of American Jews who voted in the midterms is so interesting — and revealing.</p> \n<p>American Jews (full disclosure: I'm one) are highly interested and involved in America's Middle East policy, so their opinions matter despite being about <a href=""http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2013/10/02/how-many-jews-are-there-in-the-united-states/"" target=""_blank"">2.2 percent</a> of the US population. And the polling data suggests they're likely to back President Obama's approach — because they're mostly Democrats.</p> \n<p><span>First, though, a word about the poll itself. It was commissioned by the left-wing Jewish lobby J-Street, which focuses on a two-state solution to the Israel-Palestine conflict. J-Street hired a polling firm to call 800 Jews who voted in the midterms after the polls closed, and asked them 60 questions about the election and American Middle East policy.</span></p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""right"">These numbers are especially surprising because US-Israel relations are in the toilet</q></p> \n<p>The questions about policy itself aren't necessarily the most important part of the poll: it's easy to shift responses to complex policy questions depending on how you word the prompt. Rather, the key points of the poll are the straightforward questions about American Jews' views of Obama and the election. It turns out the most salient point of the American Jewish approach to politics isn't pro-Israel sentiment or greater concerns about terrorism. It's that they're <i>highly partisan Democrats</i>.</p> \n<p>In the poll, American Jews approved of Obama's job performance by a 57-43 margin. Nationally, Obama's numbers are basically the reverse: Americans as a whole <a href=""http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/other/president_obama_job_approval-1044.html"" target=""_blank"">disapprove by about 42-53</a>. Moreover, Jews have deeply negative views of the Republican Party, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, and Speaker of the House John Boehner. Asked to rate their feelings on a scale of zero (very unfavorable) to 100 (very favorable), the respective means for each of those three are 28, 24, and 25.</p> \n<p>Moreover, Jews are Democrats for the same reasons other groups of Americans are: domestic policy. While Jews might care more about foreign policy more than your average American, the top three issues for American Jews in the election were the economy, health care, and Social Security/Medicare. Israel barely cracks the top ten.</p> \n<p>These numbers are especially surprising because US-Israel relations are in the toilet. One Obama official, fed up with sniping from Benjamin Netanyahu's government, called the Israeli Prime Minister a ""<a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/10/29/7089853/obama-netanyahu-chickenshit-us-israel"" target=""_blank"">chickenshit</a>"" on the record.

Israeli newspaper Ha'aretz just <a href=""http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/.premium-1.624228"" target=""_blank"">ran an article</a> with the headline ""Netanyahu rooting for Republicans in the US midterms."" <span>Despite all of this public tension, American Jews are still loyal Democratic partisans.</span></p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""right"">Bottom line: American Jews are Democrats, and support Democrats for public office</q></p> \n<p><span>American Jews clearly believe their basic pro-Israel commitments are consistent with being Democrats and Obama supporters — or they care way less about Israel than the level of Jewish activism on the issue would suggest. Either way, the midterms show that fears of a Jewish backlash against Democrats are way overblown.</span></p> \n<p>This gives the Obama administration a freer political hand on issues like the Iranian nuclear program. Given American Jews' strong Democratic identity, the Obama administration and Congressional Democrats don't need to be afraid of alienating a core constituency by pursuing a policy the Israeli government opposes. In fact, zero percent of American Jews in the poll said Iran was a priority in their midterm voting.</p> \n<p>Bottom line: American Jews are Democrats, and they support Democrats for public office. Unless the party radically changes its approach to the Middle East, that won't change — and even then, it might not.</p>",Politics

It is, at this point, trite to observe that the cost of Obama's successes has been further damage to the political system he promised to heal. As former White House press officer Reid Cherlin <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/8/6/5974807/the-deep-irony-of-barack-obamas-presidency-in-one-sentence"">wrote</a>, the administration has managed to ""accomplish much of what Obama promised to do, even if accomplishing it helped speed the process of partisan breakdown.""</p> \n<p>But it would be a new level of irony for Obama, who ran for office critiquing George W.

The standard issue set, Douthat argues, is too polarized to permit any serious progress. Republicans and Democrats are not going to slip out of their conflict over taxes, or Obamacare, or immigration reform. But there are issues where the left and the right haven't yet settled into real disagreement — in part because Washington has not, in recent years, seen these ideas as worthy of much attention. Douthat advises the president to give a speech along these lines:</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>The voters have delivered divided government, and in a divided government we have an obligation to find common ground. I feel that I've been trying to do exactly that on tax reform and immigration reform, but without much success. So I'm going to switch tacks. Over the next few weeks, I'll be holding a series of meetings with prominent Republicans on a different set of issues where we might make some headway. First, I'll be inviting Senator Rob Portman to the White House to discuss moving forward on the stalled trade agenda. The week after that, I'll be inviting Senators Rand Paul and Mike Lee to have a conversation about reforming our drug laws and incarceration policies. The week following, I'll have Senator Marco Rubio and Congressman Paul Ryan in to discuss how we might find common ground on anti-poverty policy, and particularly on the expansion of the earned-income tax credit they've both endorsed. Then I'd like to have Senators Lee and Rubio back again to talk about their ideas for reducing the tax burden on working families.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>I would add a few other issues to that list, like software patents, federal procurement reform and, given the Ebola outbreak, pandemic disease response. And I'm skeptical about some of the ones Douthat mentions, like tax reform. Still, the overall point here is worth considering: Washington's politics have calcified around the issues Democrats and Republicans are used to fighting about. Why not force the agenda onto some issues they're not used to fighting about?</p> \n<h3>A return to the old Obama</h3> \n<p><img src=""http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2433554/155612425.0.jpg"" alt=""155612425.0.jpg"" data-chorus-asset-id=""2433554""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Chip Somodevilla/Getty</p> \n<p><span>The caveat here is a big one: Washington can polarize literally anything. This is an age where farm bills and infrastructure investment measures get mired in Congress and where the </span><a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/export-import-bank/what-is-the-export-import-bank"">Export-Import Bank</a><span> almost powered a government shutdown. A history of consensus is not a promise of protection in this era. The fact that the parties weren't polarized around an issue yesterday doesn't mean they won't go to war over it tomorrow. </span></p> \n<p>But it's worth a try anyway. The early years of Obama's presidency were marked by an angry conflict between him and progressives who thought he was naive about the nature of his Republican opposition. But the White House wasn't all that naive — at least not for long. The House GOP's lockstep opposition to the stimulus was a seminal moment for the Obama administration. It was nearly the first event of their presidency, and it taught them, quickly, that they weren't going to get the honeymoon period extended to past presidents.</p> \n<p>The White House still saw value in pursuing bipartisan policies. First, there was always the off-chance it would work — and, remember, the stimulus wouldn't have passed the Senate without Republican votes. But it was also good politics. As Mark Schmitt <a href=""http://prospect.org/article/theory-change-primary"" target=""_blank"">wrote</a> in a sharp analysis of Obama's theory of change:</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>Take a slightly different angle on the charge that Obama is ""naïve"" about power and partisanship. Suppose you were as non-naïve about it as I am -- but your job wasn't writing about politics, it was running for president? What should you do? In that case, your responsibility is not merely to describe the situation exactly, but to find a way to subvert it. In other words, perhaps we are being too literal in believing that ""hope"" and bipartisanship are things that Obama naively believes are present and possible, when in fact they are a tactic, a method of subverting and breaking the unified conservative power structure.</p> \n<p>Claiming the mantle of bipartisanship and national unity, and defining the problem to be solved (e.g. universal health care) puts one in a position of strength, and Republicans would defect from that position at their own risk. The public, and younger voters in particular, seem to want an end to partisanship and conflictual politics, and an administration that came in with that premise (an option not available to Senator Clinton), would have a tremendous advantage, at least for a moment.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p><span>This is even truer if Obama is simultaneously going to pursue major executive actions on issues like immigration. If he's going to go to war on some issues, he may at least be seen trying to make peace on others. If he tries and fails, then at least he can't be blamed for not trying.</span></p> \n<p>And failure, it should be said, is a real possibility. One problem in punditry is that what you might call the Strategic Fallacy: the idea that there's some political strategy out there able to cleanly solve any political problem. There isn't. The odds are that Obama's final two years in office will be ugly and unproductive, at least so far as his relationship with Congress goes. But if there is some strategy that might change that — if there is some better end to this presidency — it won't come by declaring all-out war on the Congressional Republican Empire or by leaving Obama's agenda to die in the Congress Zone. It will come by finding some way out of that choice.</p> \n<p><span>Obama is in a no-win situation right now. His only hope is to change the game.</span></p>",Politics

What Democrats can learn from Republicans,http://www.vox.com/2014/11/10/7184725/what-democrats-can-learn-from-republicans,"Democrats are better at achieving their policy goals than Republicans, but Republicans are smarter about winning political power than Democrats.","<p>At Slate, Reihan Salam has <a href=""http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/11/republicans_2014_what_the_gop_can_learn_from_democrats_about_how_to_get.single.html"" target=""_blank"">an interesting column</a> limning what Republicans can learn from Democrats. The answer, mainly, is that they can learn the messy work of passing laws. ""Republicans are just not as good as Democrats at achieving their policy goals,"" frets Salam.</p> \n<p>In this, Salam is relying on <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/9/15/6131919/democrats-and-republicans-really-are-different"" target=""_blank"">research</a> by political scientists Matt Grossmann and David Hopkins which suggests that Democrats prize policy wins while Republicans prize ideological purity. This isn't true of every Democrat, or every Republican, of course. But it's true of enough of them to create a real difference between the two parties.</p> \n<p>Take the presidencies of Bill Clinton and George W. Bush as examples. On domestic policy, both leaders strayed from their bases. Clinton reformed welfare, passed NAFTA, and prioritized balanced budgets over public spending. Bush expanded federal control over schools with No Child Left Behind, expanded entitlements with the Medicare prescription drug benefit, and blew up the deficit. <span>Today, Clinton's domestic policy is regarded as heroic among Democrats, and Bush is considered an apostate among Republicans.</span></p> \n<p><b>(Related: </b><a style=""background-color: #ffffff;"" href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/9/15/6131919/democrats-and-republicans-really-are-different"" target=""_blank"">Why Democrats and Republicans don't understand each other.</a><b>)</b></p> \n<p>The other key observation of Grossmann and Hopkins is that conservatism is much more popular than liberalism — a finding backed up in poll after poll, and consistent over decades:</p> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""2443776"" alt=""liberal conservative poll"" src=""http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2443776/liberal_vs_conservative.0.png""></p> \n<p class=""caption""><a href=""http://www.gallup.com/poll/166787/liberal-self-identification-edges-new-high-2013.aspx"">Gallup</a></p> \n<p>This has proven, counterintuitively, to be an advantage for liberal Democrats, who have had to learn to persuade people who don't find liberalism appealing in the least. ""Liberals understand that they can't win without moderates; conservatives will only concede this unfortunate fact reluctantly, if at all,"" Salam writes.</p> \n<p>Since liberal Democrats want policy wins and accept the limits of their popularity, they're are a lot better at compromising to get legislation done — and compromise is, in the American political system, the only way legislation gets done.</p> \n<p>So Salam is right. There's much Republicans can learn from Democrats. But there's much Democrats can learn from Republicans, too. <span>If Democrats are better at achieving their policy goals than Republicans, Republicans are smarter about winning political power than Democrats.</span></p> \n<h3>How conservatives win</h3> \n<p>For one thing, it's important to vote in midterm elections. That might seem an obvious point, but portions of the Democratic coalition routinely seem to forget it; Republicans don't. As Ron Brownstein <a href=""http://www.nationaljournal.com/political-connections/the-tectonic-plates-of-2014-20141103"" target=""_blank"">wrote</a>, ""the modern Democratic coalition is a boom-and-bust coalition that depends heavily on minorities and young people who turn out much less regularly in midterm than presidential elections.""</p> \n<p>As you can see in the graph below, both Democrats and liberals make up a higher percentage of the vote in presidential elections than in midterm elections. Both Republicans and conservatives show the opposite trend. Those few percentage points can be decisive:</p> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""2443796"" alt=""party_and_ideology_of_voters_by_election_cycle.0.0.png"" src=""http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2443796/party_and_ideology_of_voters_by_election_cycle.0.0.png""></p> \n<p>Behind that difference lurks a deeper lesson: Republicans — up to and including the most hardcore conservatives — are more engaged with the unglamorous, sub-presidential elections of American politics than Democrats.</p> \n<p>The difference between the Tea Party and the Occupy movement is instructive. The Tea Party channeled its revulsion towards Washington into a powerful, if temporary, takeover of the Republican Party's primary system. The result was that the GOP establishment effectively became the Tea Party.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""center""><span>The difference between the Tea Party and the Occupy movement is instructive</span></q></p> \n<p>The Occupy Wall Street movement was just the reverse. It defined itself by its unwillingness to interact with the existing machinery of the government. ""You're creating a vision of the sort of society you want to have in miniature,"" David Graeber, one of the movement's founders, <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/post/youre-creating-a-vision-of-the-sort-of-society-you-want-to-have-in-miniature/2011/08/25/gIQAXVg7HL_blog.html"" target=""_blank"">told me</a>. ""And it's a way of juxtaposing yourself against these powerful, undemocratic forces you're protesting. If you make demands, you're saying, in a way, that you're asking the people in power and the existing institutions to do something different. And one reason people have been hesitant to do that is they see these institutions as the problem.""</p> \n<h3>The boring work of sub-presidential politics</h3> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""2443870"" alt=""Chrstie"" src=""http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2443870/457864308.0.jpg""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Chris Christie, as head of the Republican Governors Association, led the GOP to a huge sweep in 2014 governor races. (Steve Pope/Getty)</p> \n<p>The Occupy Wall Street movement was, of course, an expression of the American Left, not of the Democratic Party. But you can see the echoes of that attitude in more mainstream Democratic politics. Democrats turn out excitedly for charismatic leaders able to offer a vision of changing American politics — e.g., Barack Obama, in 2008. And when congressional elections happen to coincide with exciting presidential elections, Democrats can make big gains. But they often stay home when the election will merely decide the composition of <i>existing</i> American political institutions.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""center"">""<span>the Republican Party is basically the nation's governing party""</span></q></p> \n<p>The magnitude of the Democratic Party's problems on this front are much clearer if you ignore the presidency and include statehouses. In an incisive column on the 2014 election results, Yuval Levin <a href=""http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/392147/republican-congress-yuval-levin"" target=""_blank"">writes</a>, ""Next January, Republicans will control both houses of Congress, three-fifths of the nation's governorships, and about 70 of its 99 state legislative chambers. That should mean the Republican Party is basically the nation's governing party."" Republicans also hold a 5-4 majority on the Supreme Court.</p> \n<p>Levin's point is to chide the Republicans for giving ""every impression of still understanding themselves as the opposition party, because they do not control the presidency."" <span>But the reverse is true, too: Democrats still understand themselves as the majority party despite controlling nothing but the presidency. They have captured the high ground of American politics, but lost the crucial farmland.</span></p> \n<p>Republicans have made these gains with what is, by most measures, the smaller of the two coalitions. That's why Democrats routinely win elections when turnout is high. But Republicans are doing more with less than the Democrats are — in part through <a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/gerrymandering-explained/what-is-gerrymandering"" target=""_blank"">gerrymandering</a>, in part through <a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/gerrymandering-explained/how-important-is-gerrymandering-to-republican-control-of-the-house"" target=""_blank"">population patterns</a>, but in part by focusing on elections that some Democrats often skip. The conservative movement has been focused on state legislatures and local school boards for a long time now. In that way, Republicans are much more politically efficient than Democrats.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""center""><span>Republicans are doing more with less than the Democrats are</span></q></p> \n<p>Democrats miss this tendency in themselves because they are so focused on the excesses of the Republicans who hold office. The most liberal Democrats engaged in government are far more pragmatic than the most conservative Republicans — and that can give the Democratic Party a sheen of pragmatism that the Republican Party lacks.</p> \n<p>What that obscures is the pragmatism of those Republican ideologues who actually do the work of taking over state legislatures and governorships and, ultimately, Congress. Their Democratic counterparts often sit that work out, and so there are fewer unreasonable Democrats walking the halls of the Capitol than unreasonable Republicans, but those unreasonable Republicans are demonstrating a much more pragmatic relationship to winning power — if not to using it — than those absent Democrats.</p> \n<p>When Democrats do win power they're actually quite effective at wielding it — the first two years of Barack Obama's presidency proved that. But being good at legislating isn't of much use if the other party controls all the legislatures.</p>",Politics
The real reason Valerie Jarrett is the most hated person in Washington,http://www.vox.com/2014/11/10/7184769/valerie-jarrett-partisan-presidency,"The partisan presidency has created a dirty job that someone has to do, and she's the one.","<p>The past few days have seen a couple of major pieces about Valerie Jarrett, a senior advisor to the president who people love to complain about. One, <a href=""http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2014/11/fire-valerie-jarrett-112659.html"" target=""_blank"">by Carol Felsenthal</a>, is extremely mean-spirited and basically just asserts without evidence that firing Jarrett would solve some unspecified major problems for Obama. <a href=""http://www.newrepublic.com/article/120170/valerie-jarrett-obama-whisperer"" target=""_blank"">Noam Scheiber's</a> considerably more careful profile is something anyone can learn a lot from, but basically ends up with the conclusion that Jarrett ends up re-enforcing certain ideological tendencies of Obama's — in particular, an aversion to populist rhetoric — that Scheiber dislikes.</p> \n<p>Missing from both, I think, is an examination of the most salient thing about Jarrett, namely that <i>people really hate her</i>. Not the person on the street (who probably has no idea who she is) but DC power players. You hear far more negative things said about Jarrett by current and former administration figures and Capitol Hill Democrats than you do about anyone else in the Obama orbit. One possible interpretation of this is that she's just really awful — and I think this is what a lot of people in the media have come to believe second-hand — but I think that's a mistaken one.</p> \n<p>Some of it is surely sexism. There is a set of gendered scripts about the <i>eminence grise</i> versus the scheming Lady MacBeth type that some Jarrett commentary plays into. Still, she's hardly the only woman on the White House staff. To understand why Jarrett is so hated, you have to understand her unique structural role in the Obama administration. She's the person in the building who is supposed to represent Obama himself and his unique perspective on his own presidency. That naturally pushes her into conflict with an array of other figures who represent a more generic version of a Democratic Party administration.</p> \n<h3>The partisan presidency</h3> \n<p>When politics was less polarized, White House staffs were personalized. JFK's team was full of <i>Kennedy people</i>, not generic Democrats. After all, at a time when the parties weren't ideologically coherent there wasn't really any such thing as a generic Democrat or Republican. The president was relatively unconstrained vis a vis the party system on the Hill, and both the team and the policies they pursued could be very idiosyncratic.</p> \n<p><span>But </span><a style=""line-height: 1.5; background-color: #ffffff;"" href=""http://works.bepress.com/richard_skinner/4/"" target=""_blank"">starting with Ronald Reagan</a><span> and continuing </span><a style=""line-height: 1.5; background-color: #ffffff;"" href=""https://www.uakron.edu/bliss/docs/state-of-the-parties-documents/Skinner--BarackObamaandthePartisanPresidency_stateoftheparties_.pdf"" target=""_blank"">through to Obama</a><span>, we've seen the rise of what American University's Richard Skinner calls ""the partisan presidency."" The president works as the leader and agent of a relatively disciplined, relatively coherent political party. That's reflected in his staff.</span></p> \n<p><span>In the early years, the Obama administration was often said to be full of ""Clintonites."" In truth, it was just full of </span><i style=""line-height: 1.5;"">experienced Democrats. </i><span>A lot of them had worked in the Clinton White House, but others had been with Tom Daschle or Dick Gephardt or Max Baucus or other prominent Congressional Democrats. </span></p> \n<p>Jarrett is the exception to that rule. She wasn't in national politics before 2009 and when Obama leaves office she'll go wherever he goes. She the representative of <i>his</i> interests — his priorities, his legacy — as opposed to party or interest group concerns.</p> \n<p>This is a valuable role to play, but it very naturally sets her up to be hated. In addition to her formal role as Barack Obama's personal representative to outside groups, her informal role in the counsels of state is to get in people's way and make calls that wouldn't get made in a fully genericized White House. Naturally, that ends up with her stepping on toes and making enemies. Not because she's doing her job poorly, but because that's her role in the administration. And it's a very difficult job.</p> \n<h3>The haters next time</h3> \n<p>It'll be interesting to see how future administrations handle this. The partisan presidency is a relatively new phenomenon, and like other consequences of the rise of ideological parties in the 1980s the political system is still learning to adjust to it. It's possible that there is a superior solution to the one Obama hit on. But you have to understand it as a structural issue.</p> \n<p>Even as the presidency becomes de-personalized, the president is still a person and he is going to want his personal interests to be represented in his own administration. Future presidents are likely to find themselves with the opposite of Obama's Valerie Jarrett problem.<span> Jarrett's is clearly willing to be disliked, and that makes her more effective in her role as Obama's personal advocate. The problem for future presidents is that they may not be able to find a Jarrett. </span><span>Whoever they task with serving as their alter ego in staff meetings and calls to agencies and outside stakeholders will end up wanting to go along to get along.</span></p> \n<p>There's considerable evidence that <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.vox.com/xpress/2014/10/23/7048353/workplace-diversity-is-hard-for-the-exact-same-reason-its-so-important"">personal conflict makes organizations more effective</a>. But at the same time, people don't enjoy it. Pushing on the tension between the president-as-person and the president-as-abstract-agent is a useful role, but not an especially rewarding one and it's not obvious that every president will have someone on hand to do it.</p>",Politics

Sea-level rise, in particular, is a big infringement of property rights — something that libertarians and conservatives care a lot about in other contexts. So doing nothing isn't an option. But he's also skeptical that heavy regulation will actually solve the problem.</p> \n<p><span>""I'm not a fan of regulating greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act [as the Obama administration is doing],"" he told me.

The US government currently levies all sorts of taxes on people and companies, and many of these taxes end up discouraging work. That's bad. So why not repeal some of those taxes and replace them with a tax on something we actually want to discourage — namely, carbon emissions? Then companies can figure out on their own how best to reduce pollution, instead of being told by regulators.</p> \n<p>""It's funny,"" Adler said, ""when I first came to Washington, DC in 1988, there were tons of folks on the right talking about how they wanted to tax consumption rather than labor or wealth. And a revenue neutral carbon tax that's rebated the way folks like Art Laffer or Bob Inglis <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/03/14/could-republicans-ever-support-a-carbon-tax-bob-inglis-thinks-so/"">have proposed</a>, that's effectively what it does.

Former South Carolina Representative Bob Inglis <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/03/14/could-republicans-ever-support-a-carbon-tax-bob-inglis-thinks-so/"">has been trying to convince</a> his fellow Republicans to accept a carbon tax as a climate solution. Part of his pitch — although he doesn't phrase it this way — is to suggest a form of carbon tax that makes Democrats uncomfortable. A carbon tax, he argues, should be used to finance corporate tax cuts or income tax cuts. It shouldn't be used to provide public support for clean energy, as many green groups prefer.</p> \n<p>""We have to be absolutely clear that we're not trying to grow the size of government,"" Inglis told me last year. He's still trying to sell the idea to the GOP — though there haven't been any major breakthroughs yet.</p> \n<h3>Carbon taxes are also an imperfect climate solution</h3> \n<p><img src=""http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2445870/494422629.0.jpg"" alt=""494422629.0.jpg"" data-chorus-asset-id=""2445870""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Solar tracker panels follow the sun's path May 17, 2014 on a Champlain Valley dairy farm near West Haven, Vermont.

Things get messy quickly.</p> \n<p>There are other complications, too: Carbon taxes may be the most economically elegant way to tackle greenhouse-gas emissions, but they can also be unpopular.

That's why politicians often resort to indirect and clumsier regulations whose costs are easier to mask.</p> \n<p>So a carbon tax would be a good start, but it's unlikely to be the last word on addressing climate change. Which makes it harder to argue that there's an easy ""free-market friendly solution"" to global warming just lying around out there.

From World War I to Rand Paul,http://www.vox.com/2014/10/28/7022003/rand-paul-non-interventionism-daniel-mccarthy,"An interview with Daniel McCarthy, editor of The American Conservative, on the history behind Rand Paul's worldview.","What does Rand Paul believe? His recent foreign policy address, a thinly veiled audition for his 2016 presidential candidacy, made one thing plain: Paul wants to <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/10/24/7053561/rand-paul-foreign-policy-speech"">scale back American involvement in foreign wars</a>. To understand why, you have to understand where his ideas come from. Paul is the heir to a tradition, dating at least back to the 1890s, of conservative non-interventionism: the idea that it is not America's place to be involved in the affairs of the world. The history of this movement is complicated. So I spoke to Daniel McCarthy, editor of prominent non-interventionist magazine <em>The American Conservative</em>, about the non-interventionist movement's history — and its influence on Paul. <div class=""chorus-snippet center""> \n<div class=""chorus-snippet""> \n<p><toggles class=""hide-on-external-post"">story,interview</toggles></p> \n<story> \n<p>Paul doesn't call himself a non-interventionist. In his recent foreign policy address, he used the phrase ""conservative realism"" to describe his approach to the world. But according to McCarthy, the branding is Rand's attempt to make non-interventionism palatable to the modern Republican electorate, which has <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/6/27/5847264/left-right-foreign-policy-pew"">a pretty hawkish worldview</a>. ""Even though he likes the non-interventionist roadmap, he's willing to deviate from it if he thinks it's realistic in policy terms, let alone political ones,"" McCarthy says.</p> \n<p>In practice, that means you'll see Paul defending some pretty aggressive policies (e.g., his declaration that ""I support a strategy of air strikes against ISIS"") even while staying on the non-interventionist side of the Washington consensus (e.g., opposing arming the Syrian rebels and ground troops).<b> </b><span>I</span><span>t wasn't always that way.</span><span> </span><span>In the past, Paul wouldn't have needed to qualify his non-interventionist position so much.</span><span> </span><span>The American conservative mainstream was once far more skeptical of the use of American force abroad than it was today.</span></p> \n<h3>How World War I created non-interventionism</h3> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""2396372"" alt=""Pacifism anti-war world war i"" src=""http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2396372/53508441.0.jpg""></p> \n<p>Since the American founding, and maybe even before then, there's been a deep tension in America's impulses on foreign policy. On the one hand, Americans were deeply skeptical of getting involved in European power politics. On the other hand, American policy towards its neighbors — particularly American Indians and Latin American nations — was aggressively, violently imperialist. There's never been a truly isolationist America, or even a particularly peaceful one.</p> \n<p>That said, concern about getting involved outside of the Americas — see George Washington's famous criticism of ""permanent alliances"" in his <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/washing.asp"">Farewell Address</a> — has had a real impact on American foreign policy. The sentiment behind it began to develop into a coherent ideology in the 1890s, when the US launched the Spanish-American war and started looking more like a global imperial power.</p> \n<div class=""chorus-snippet m-fishtank no-responsive-video""> \n<div data-ad-slot=""athena_features""></div> \n</div> \n<p>As McCarthy tells it, the movement that would one day birth Rand Paul is the child of two different parents: World War I and Franklin Delano Roosevelt. Each plays a critically important, but different, role in creating a uniquely <i>conservative</i> critique of American empire.</p> \n<p>The Great War's pointless slaughter, according to McCarthy, galvanized American critics of foreign entanglement. ""After World War I,"" he says, there are many ""former progressives, people who were on their way to becoming the forerunners of modern libertarianism, who are now strongly, strongly anti-war."" The American public was deeply sympathetic to their cause. Though the idea that America became ""isolationist"" after World War I is <a href=""http://www.nationaljournal.com/magazine/rand-paul-and-the-myth-of-american-isolationism-20141017"" target=""_blank"">largely ahistorical</a>, public opposition to foreign wars sharply limited <a href=""https://history.state.gov/milestones/1937-1945/american-isolationism"" target=""_blank"">both Woodrow Wilson's and FDR's ability</a> to get the US involved in the world wars.</p> \n<p>The skepticism was, to a degree, cross-ideological: neither the American left nor the right liked what they saw in 1918. It took FDR for conservative non-interventionism to become a unique ideology.</p> \n<h3>The right goes to war</h3> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""2396336"" alt=""world war II protest"" src=""http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2396336/WHProtest1941.0.jpg""></p> \n<p>The anti-FDR backlash is the key historical development for understanding Rand Paul."" <span>In the 1930s, the right becomes defined by being opposed to the New Deal,"" McCarthy says. ""A lot of these guys who came out of the progressive tradition and had been individualist people of the left, because they really don't like the New Deal, wind up gravitating towards some of the commercial interests that are opposed to the New Deal."" The opposition to foreign wars and the expansion of the US government becomes linked.</span></p> \n<p><b></b>The backbone of Paul's worldview is that foreign policy is just like any other big government project: wasteful, opposed to freedom, and, by and large, counterproductive. While George W. Bush-style neoconservatives believe that a heavy dose of American might can improve the world, Paul's conservatism worries about America acting as a global welfare state.</p> \n<p>This version of conservatism has been out of vogue since World War II. Its last major elected proponent was Sen. Robert A. Taft, the son of President William Taft, who died in 1953.</p> \n<p>The reason conservative non-interventionism collapsed in the 1940s is pretty simple: it was utterly, spectacularly wrong about World War II. Right up until Pearl Harbor, the movement was ""still thinking in terms of the war they've seen before, as opposed to the new questions involved in World War II,"" McCarthy says.</p> \n<p>Then the Cold War began, and non-interventionism gave way to anti-Communism. As articulated in the late '40s, this conservatism felt ""kind of archaic, out of date"" McCarthy says. ""It doesn't have a lot of cache, and the people who expound it are pretty old — they're in their '60s or their '70s."" Cold Warriors, like National Review's William F. Buckley, carry the day.</p> \n<h3>The Cold War Right and Rand Paul</h3> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""2388170"" alt=""rand paul john mccain"" src=""http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2388170/129163093.0.jpg""></p> \n<p><span></span></p> \n<p class=""caption""> </p> \n<p>The Cold War turned conservative non-interventionism into what McCarthy calls a ""sub-culture;"" or, more accurately, sub-cultures. As mainstream conservatism became more hawkish, a variety of non-interventionisms flourished on the margins. Each of these had, in McCarthy's estimation, a degree of influence on Rand Paul's worldview.</p> \n<p>First, a group of libertarians centered on Murray Rothbard, a leading light of American libertarianism during the 20th century, developed an absolutist critique of American interventionism: the United States, according to Rothbard, needed to end the Cold War and withdraw almost entirely from military involvement in the world. The most influential elected avatar of the Rothbardian position is Rand's father, former Congressman Ron Paul. ""Rand is also aware of where his father's coming from,"" McCarthy says, and has ""sort of absorbed it indirectly from his father.""</p> \n<p>That said, Rand is very much not his father. ""Things like NATO exist,"" McCarthy says, and ""the Rothbardian position is we can just abolish all of this."" That's impossible, and it's not clear Rand even wants to go that far. Instead, Rand's position is much more moderate — something he shares in common with post-world War II conservatives like Robert Nisbet and Russell Kirk. These conservatives saw non-interventionism as sort of a guiding principle; the United States should minimize its involvement in world affairs as much as possible, but some problems — in their case, Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union — required a vigorous American response. Paul's support for military measures against terrorist groups like ISIS shows that he shares that pragmatism, in stark contrast to his Rothbardian father.</p> \n<p>There's also a darker element of the American non-interventionist right. McCarthy delicately calls this a ""populist"" strain, which is true, but it's also paranoid and xenophobic. From Joseph McCarthy's witch hunt to the <a href=""http://www.splcenter.org/home/2012/spring/bringing-back-birch"" target=""_blank"">John Birch Society's outright racism</a>, this group is suspicious of so-called foreigners and wants America to avoid being contaminated by them<span>. </span><span>There's zero reason to believe Rand Paul shares any of this group's truly toxic beliefs, but what McCarthy calls ""the kind of populist right that dislikes the idea that we're involved with foreign cultures"" has undeniably been a major part of the anti-war right.</span></p> \n<p>Paul's worldview, though, is more modern than all that. He owes a lot to the so-called paleoconservatives of the 1990s, who believed America's mission in the world collapsed with the Berlin Wall. These paleocons were temporarily marginalized after 9/11, but the Iraq War revived non-interventionism with a vengeance. Paleocons and libertarians were joined by more establishmentarian realists, people who support America acting globally to advance its interests but were appalled by Bush's counter-productive and deadly use of force.</p> \n<p>Paul's foreign policy reflects all of these beliefs, both out of genuine influence and political necessity. He needs to build a non-interventionism that can unify these groups and challenge Bush-era neoconservatism for control over the Republican Party. <span>""Every indication I see from his speeches is that he's someone who wants to think through this step-by-step,"" McCarthy says.</span></p> \n<p>Remaking a political party is a <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/10/24/7053561/rand-paul-foreign-policy-speech"" target=""_blank"">monumental task</a>. But Paul has about a century of conservative foreign policy thinking at his back.</p> \n</story> <interview> \n<div class=""question""> \n<p><em class=""name"">Zack Beauchamp:</em>How do you trace the history of the non-interventionist movement? Where did it originate in the United States?</p> \n</div> \n<div class=""answer""> \n<p><em class=""name"">Daniel McCarthy:</em>For much of its history, the United States didn't need to be involved very deeply in European affairs. That was true for most of the 19th century, and I think that created a kind of conscious feeling among Americans in general that getting involved in world affairs was not part of our national calling.</p> \n</div> \n<p>So when you get to the point of the 1890s, you have the US getting into the Spanish-American war and starting to take over some of Spain's colonies — and there are already a number of Americans who are primed to resist this. They do so with all sorts of ideological justifications: the Anti-Imperial League of the 1890s had left-wing and right-wing components.</p> \n<p>As we get towards World War I, you get a number of classical liberals — proto-libertarians — who are opposed to getting the US involved in World War I, and others that are converted by the war. Take H.L. Mencken.</p> \n<p>Mencken had been somewhat more Anglophile before World War I — and somewhat more pro-war. He has a famous essay called ""<a href=""http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1914/11/the-mailed-fist-and-its-prophet/306393/"" style=""line-height: 1.5; background-color: #ffffff;"">The Mailed Fist</a>,"" where he talks about how wonderful another war was going to be. But w<span>hen we get out of World War I, Mencken and people like him that kind of attitude is a lot less common among people like Mencken — proto-libertarians or classical liberals.</span></p> \n<div class=""question""> \n<p><em class=""name"">Zack Beauchamp:</em>The pre-World War II years are usually seen as the high-water mark for right-wing American non-interventionism — or, pejoratively, isolationism. What happened?</p> \n</div> \n<div class=""answer""> \n<p><em class=""name"">Daniel McCarthy:</em><span>After World War I, you've got a lot of people: former progressives, people who were on their way to becoming the forerunners of modern libertarianism, who are now strongly, strongly anti-war. This is the genesis of libertarian and old right strains of non-interventionism — partly to the 1890s, and much more to World War I. Before the anti-New Deal right forms, I wouldn't say there really is an anti-war right distinct from other kinds of anti-war perspectives.</span></p> \n<p>It's only once you have the New Deal, and you're heading towards World War II, that you're getting a definite sort of right-wing strain of non-interventionism.  In the 1930s, the right becomes defined by being opposed to the New Deal. A lot of these guys who came out of the progressive tradition and had been individualist people of the left, because they really don't like the New Deal, wind up gravitating towards some of the commercial interests that are opposed to the New Deal. The way politics changes in the 1930s makes them more right-wing in their affections and their alliances, and that gets folded into the anti-war perspective.</p> \n<p><span>World War I kind of sets the pattern for World War II. They're still thinking in terms of the war they've seen before, as opposed to the new questions involved in World War II. Groups like America First, which opposed American entry into World War II, had a lot of ideological diversity: people like Gerald Ford and Joseph Kennedy were members. This is part of the old-time American belief that we don't have to be involved in world affairs.</span></p> \n<p>American First called it<b> </b>a day after Pearl Harbor. And it became a sort of quiescent period for non-interventionists during World War II. After World War II, you get the question of communism — and the right, which had a strong libertarian anti-war component, is really divided.</p> \n<p>Some people, of an older generation, wanted to go straight back to non-interventionism. They're pretty strongly anti-Cold War: they experienced the hysteria of World War I, and saw how it turned out and all of the disillusionment Americans felt about the outcome.</p> \n<p>But then you have a change of world circumstances with World War II and then the Cold War. This perspective is just kind of archaic, out of date. It doesn't have a lot of cache, and the people who expound it are pretty old — they're in their 60s or their 70s. Whereas young people, like William F. Buckley, have a different perspective, and are really the ones shaping the right at that point.</p> \n</div> \n<div class=""question""> \n<p><em class=""name"">Zack Beauchamp:</em>What happens to the non-interventionist movement during the Cold War, as mainstream conservatism gets more and more interventionist and aggressively anti-Communist?</p> \n</div> \n<div class=""answer""> \n<p><em class=""name"">Daniel McCarthy:</em><span>It becomes a kind of sub-culture. Murray Rothbard becomes a towering figure in terms of building a libertarian movement that's distinct from the conservative movement. In the '50s, Rothbard is very closely tied in with conservatives; there's not really a separate libertarian movement. Rothbard retains the old right position; he's very opposed to the Cold War and US interventionism generally.</span></p> \n<p>From the '50s to the '70s, Rothbard is kind of a one-man institution. He starts a number of publications, he's involved in founding the Cato Institute, and he gets involved in the Libertarian Party pretty soon after its founding. <span>He's also a very charismatic and dynamic figure, so he brings a number of disciples around himself. </span></p> \n<p><span>So you have a non-interventionist strain that survives, gets new blood from Rothbard, and becomes an undercurrent on the right. </span><span>Ron Paul actually kind of reflects this today.</span></p> \n<p><span>Not only do you have a small-but-intense libertarian cadre that's strongly non-interventionist, but you also have these more traditionalist conservatives, like Russell Kirk and Robert Nisbet. </span><span>They're willing to make an exception for the Cold War and retrospectively World War II, but </span><span>they also have a lot of emotional attachment to the idea that this is really a departure from our tradition. They're looking forward to a time where America can come home again. </span></p> \n<p><span>Nisbet and Kirk live into the '90s, and they become some of the people who help revive non-interventionism again on the non-libertarian side.</span></p> \n</div> \n<div class=""question""> \n<p><em class=""name"">Zack Beauchamp:</em>Ron Paul is the most famous conservative non-interventionist alive today, aside from perhaps his son. Did his ideas come mostly from Rothbard?</p> \n</div> \n<div class=""answer""> \n<p><em class=""name"">Daniel McCarthy:</em><span>Oh yeah, he's very much coming from the Rothbard perspective. But sometimes that can be exaggerated: there's another economist, named Hans Sennholz, who's as influential if not more so on Ron Paul as Rothbard. </span><span>I wouldn't say that Ron Paul is simply translating Rothbard's </span><span>politics</span><span> into politics today, but he is strongly influenced by Rothbard and the larger pool of thought on which he was an example.</span></p> \n<p><span>There's another angle that's worth highlighting: a general conservative distrust of American foreign policy elites. During the Cold War, conservatives become pro-intervention as part of anti-Communism. But at the same time, you had just had a very long run of Democratic administrations under FDR and Truman. And the right wasn't even all that fond of Dwight Eisenhower; he defeats Robert Taft, who's seen as the great hope for non-interventionist conservatives, during the 1950s.</span></p> \n<p>As a result, you get a new kind of critique of American foreign policy start to develop during the '50s on the right. What I'm talking about is symbolized by McCarthyism. Joe McCarthy was attacking the State Department, saying it's influenced by Communists. This sounds like a hysterical ""let's go to war with the Commies"" thing, and it is that. But it also has an anti-war component to it, in a sense, because it's saying that our Cold War policies are actually counterproductive and un-American. McCarthy gets taken down, after all, after he says the US Army is infiltrated by Communists.</p> \n<p>So vociferous anti-Communism combines with the idea that the American foreign policy establishment is anti-American. It gets reflected in the John Birch Society, for example, and a number of institutions on the grassroots and far-right. You can see that there is a bridge between this sort of paranoia about the foreign policy establishment and non-interventionism later on. For example, grassroots conservative concern about the UN or foreign aid.</p> \n<p>Ron Paul isn't necessarily intellectually influenced by that, but in a rhetorical or emotional sense, he is.</p> \n</div> \n<div class=""question""> \n<p><em class=""name"">Zack Beauchamp:</em>Ron Paul was first elected in the late '70s. What happened to the non-interventionist movement after that — in the '80s, '90s, and going into the war on terror?</p> \n</div> \n<div class=""answer""> \n<p><em class=""name"">Daniel McCarthy:</em><span>That's really when it revives. Going into the 1990s, you already have a split on the right about globalization: neoconservatives are more open to trade, while the more non-interventionist wing is more skeptical. </span><span>Once the Cold War ends, foreign policy then becomes a very strong component of this division. The neocons say, ""Look, the American idea still has to be exported to the world in the same way that it does during the Cold War; we still have to go out and transform repressive regimes.""</span></p> \n<p><span>The paleoconservatives — the newest incarnation of the non-interventionist movement —  say, ""Wait a minute, we're a nation-state, we're not really about </span>exporting<span> our ideas and </span>trying<span> to revolutionize the world."" That's how you get a very strong division between neocons and paleocons on foreign policy. </span></p> \n<p>The paleocons become in part a brain trust for Pat Buchanan, who gets close, in 1996, to actually wresting the [presidential] nomination away from Bob Dole. People forget that the 1996 election was a real fight for a while there.</p> \n<p>You also have a lot of Republican congressmen, elected in 1994, who are not necessarily all the way to being non-interventionist, but who are much less favorable towards interventionism than neoconservatives would like. Opposing Clinton in every way included opposing Clinton's foreign policy, and part of Clinton's foreign policy was his interventionism in the Balkans and a few other places.</p> \n<p>So that becomes a dimension, but it's kind of muted. There's not really a direct pipeline from these explicitly anti-war elements on the right to Republican congressmen. But there's definitely a kind of osmotic influence: these anti-war institutions on the right are changing the way things are discussed among conservatives, and that has a knock-on effect among conservatives themselves.</p> \n</div> \n<div class=""question""> \n<p><em class=""name"">Zack Beauchamp:</em>: And then you have 9/11.</p> \n</div> \n<div class=""answer""> \n<p><em class=""name"">Daniel McCarthy:</em><span>In some ways, 9/11 is kind of an aberrant period. It's really the Iraq war that transforms the right even more than 9/11 itself. As we approach the Iraq war, the people who opposed American interventionism on the right are still strongly opposed to going to war in Iraq under President Bush. But President Bush has basically a blank check from Congressional Republicans — and Democrats — to do what he wants.</span></p> \n<p>But the Iraq war [created] a whole new set of anti-war people on the right. A lot of conservatives who had been Cold Warriors and sort of quiet during the 1990s were just appalled: not only by Bush's rush to war in Iraq, but also by the fact that the conservative movement didn't do any kind of due diligence, any kind of vetting of Bush's claims. They were monolithically going to support Bush's war.</p> \n</div> \n<div class=""question""> \n<p><em class=""name"">Zack Beauchamp:</em>: Do you see, in Rand Paul's current political incarnation, influences from any of these debates or any particular elements of these different non-interventionisms?</p> \n</div> \n<div class=""answer""> \n<p><em class=""name"">Daniel McCarthy:</em><span>I think you can see different elements of these threads in Paul. So, for example, you can see an appeal to the kind of populist right that dislikes the idea that we're involved with foreign cultures in his critique of foreign aid.</span></p> \n<p>Rand is also aware of where his father's coming from, and he shares some of the cold war libertarian skepticism about American interventionism. But I don't think that Rand is someone who reads Rothbard on a regular basis or something like that. I think Rand more has absorbed it indirectly from his father, but he's aware that it doesn't quite mesh with political reality in the Republican Party or what America's existing commitments are.</p> \n<p>Things like NATO exist. The Rothbardian position is we can just abolish all of this, but those are things that'll take a very long time if they can ever be achieved at all. I don't think Rand is hell-bent on trying to get there by taking some kind of shortcut.</p> \n<p>Every indication I see from his speeches is that he's someone who wants to think through this step-by-step. Even though he likes the non-interventionist roadmap, he's willing to deviate from it if he thinks it's realistic in policy terms, let alone political ones.</p> \n</div> \n<p> </p> \n</interview>\n</div> \n<p><!--  ########  END SNIPPET  ########  --></p> \n<p> </p> \n<p><br id=""1407255417648""></p> \n</div>",Politics

Republican Govs. Scott Walker, Sam Brownback, and Rick Snyder held on in Wisconsin, Kansas, and Michigan, respectively. And some Democratic incumbents, like Illinois Gov. Pat Quinn, had surprise losses too. Charlie Baker beat Martha Coakley to gain the Massachusetts governorship for Republicans. Vermont's Pete Shumlin got less than a majority, meaning the race goes to the state legislature; both chambers are Democrat-controlled, so Shumlin will almost certainly win, but it's still not ideal. Governor's races weren't the silver lining to the Senate results Democrats hoped they'd would be.

A few states are still coming in as of this writing, but overall it's a very good night for Republicans. Republicans gained the New Mexico, Minnesota, West Virginia, and New Hampshire Houses. The Nevada Senate flipped too. The West Virginia Senate, also formerly in Democratic hands, is tied. While Republicans ran the New York State Senate due to an agreement with moderate Democrats before this election, they now control it outright.

After that, the state has a year and a half to set up legal sales.

The unemployment rate has fallen dramatically, to about the same level as in 2002, a year when the incumbent Republicans actually gained seats. Then again, it's also the same level as 2006, when the president's party weathered massive losses. Economic factors just don't play the same, key role in midterms that they do in presidential elections.

That might seem counteirntuitive, given that the president isn't actually on the ballot, but the chart makes the inverse relationship between presidential approval and losses incurred by his party pretty apparent. Midterms almost never lead to gains for the president's party; that's only happened three times (1934, 1998, and 2002) in the past century, and under extraordinary circumstances in each case (the Great Depression, Bill Clinton's impending impeachment, and 9/11). The losses are worse when the president is personally unpopular. 2014 played into that pattern, as Obama's low approval ratings translated into heavy Democratic losses.

That sounds like a good thing, but it also means they have more wasted votes (that is, votes above the last one needed to win the election). If those wasted votes were distributed in other races, they could theoretically swing some additional seats toward Democrats. A significant factor here is that Democrats tend to cluster geographically in cities. Redistricting tends to lean in favor of keeping geographic regions together, which means heavily Democratic urban districts and less heavily Republican rural distrcts, implicitly advantaging Republicans. To avoid that, you'd need to draw districts that blend together areas with little in common (inner city Pittsburgh with central Pennsylvania, for example). These kinds of districts are, as political scientists Jowei Chen and Jonathan Rodden <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/26/opinion/sunday/its-the-geography-stupid.html?_r=0"">put it</a>, ""unlikely to emerge by chance from a nonpartisan process,"" and they're <i>definitely</i> unlikely to emerge from a partisan, Republican-led redistricting process. And there were <a href=""http://redistricting.lls.edu/who-partyfed.php"">far more nonpartisan or Republican-led redistricting processes</a> than Democrat-run ones. The result is that wasted votes create a significant (~ 6%) advantage for Republicans, as illustrated by the chart above.</p> \n        </div> \n      </li> \n     \n     \n   \n     \n      <li class=""list-26 clearfix feature-photos-list-item""> \n        <div class=""feature-photos-photo feature-photos-column""> \n          <div class=""vox-photo-hack""> \n             \n              <a href=""http://nationalmap.gov/small_scale/printable/images/pdf/congdist/pagecgd113_md.pdf"" target=""_black""><img class=""lazy zoom"" data-src=""http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2428462/Screen_Shot_2014-11-04_at_5.46.40_PM.0.png""></a> \n              <a href=""http://nationalmap.gov/small_scale/printable/images/pdf/congdist/pagecgd113_md.pdf"" target=""_blank"" class=""icon-link-ext-alt""></a> \n             \n          </div> \n          <p class=""feature-photos-caption""> \n            <a href=""http://nationalmap.gov/small_scale/printable/images/pdf/congdist/pagecgd113_md.pdf""> \n              National Atlas of the United States \n            </a> \n          </p> \n        </div> \n        <div class=""feature-photos-story feature-photos-column""> \n          <h4>Gerrymandering helped both parties, but especially Republicans</h4> \n          <p>Political scientists disagree about the degree to which gerrymandering is responsible for Republicans' House majority. But there's general agreement, as Vox's Andrew Prokop <a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/gerrymandering-explained/how-important-is-gerrymandering-to-republican-control-of-the-house"">put it</a>, that there have been ""some egregious partisan gerrymanders"" since the 2010 Census. Because Republicans controlled more state governments than Democrats did post-2010, those gerrymanders disproportionately benefited Republicans, but Democratic states got in on the action too. Here's Maryland's map, which divvies up liberal areas (Baltimore, the DC suburbs), then combines them with less liberal portions of the state; that means Democrats have smaller win margins but more seats overall, and only one seat (the one bordering Delaware) is left to be represented by a Republican. Compare that to Pennsylvania, where Republicans did the opposite: packing liberal urban segments into as few districts as possible, and conceding them to the Democrats to maximize Republican chances in the rest of the state.

A number of Democratic female candidates, like Massachusetts' Martha Coakley and Wisconsin's Mary Burke, were in close races in states with male incumbents.

Is wage stagnation killing the Democratic Party?,http://www.vox.com/2014/11/12/7204439/is-wage-stagnation-killing-the-democratic-party,Are voters angry at Democrats because of the economy?,"<p>In an interesting column at <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/11/upshot/the-great-wage-slowdown-looming-over-politics.html?hp&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;module=second-column-region&amp;region=top-news&amp;WT.nav=top-news&amp;_r=1&amp;abt=0002&amp;abg=1"">The Upshot</a>, David Leonhardt argues that the Democratic Party's 2014 drubbing can be traced back to their inability to clearly answer this question: ""How does the Democratic Party plan to lift stagnant middle-class incomes?""</p> \n<p>The facts here are stark: ""Median inflation-adjusted income last year was still $2,100 lower than when President Obama took office in 2009  —  and $3,600 lower than when President George W. Bush took office in 2001,"" Leonhardt writes. He calls this ""the Great Wage Slowdown of the 21st Century,"" and says that ""nothing presents a larger threat to the Democrats' electoral fortunes than that slowdown.""</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""center""><span>""nothing presents a larger threat to the Democrats' electoral fortunes than that slowdown""</span></q></p> \n<p>Like Leonhardt, I think the wage slowdown is one of the defining issues of our time. And I would actually like it to be the force driving American politics. But I'm not sure it is. A few reasons for skepticism:</p> \n<p><b> 1) According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, average hourly earnings <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://data.bls.gov/timeseries/CES0500000003?output_view=net_1mth"">rose</a> at roughly the same rate during 2011-2012 as they did during 2013-2014.</b> But one of those cycles ended with Democrats routing the Republican Party and the other ended with Republicans routing the Democratic Party. It's hard to attribute such wildly different electoral outcomes to such a stable trend.</p> \n<p><b> 2) Democrats didn't do noticeably better in states <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.bls.gov/web/laus/laumstrk.htm"">with better economies</a>.</b> South Dakota, for instance, has the second-lowest unemployment rate in the nation — but Democrats lost the Senate seat there. Iowa, Montana and Colorado have the 10th, 11th, and 12th lowest unemployment rates —  but Democrats got stomped in all three states. Meanwhile, California, Michigan and Oregon have some of the highest unemployment rates in the country —  but all three were bright spots for Democrats.</p> \n<p><b>3) Among voters who said ""the economy"" is the most important issue in American politics, the election was extremely close. </b>48 percent of those voters sided with the Democrats, and 50 percent sided with the Republicans. The really lopsided margins against Democrats came among the 14 percent of voters who said illegal immigration was the top issue (74 percent voted for Republicans) and the 13 percent of voters who said foreign policy was the top issue (56 percent voted for the Republicans).</p> \n<p> </p> \n<center> <img src=""http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2451152/vote_economy_2014.0.jpg"" alt=""vote economy 2014 exit"" data-chorus-asset-id=""2451152""> \n<p class=""caption""><a href=""http://www.cnn.com/election/2014/results/race/house#exit-polls"">CNN</a></p> \n</center> \n<p><b>4) Democrats won the most votes among voters with the lowest incomes.</b> They won 59 percent of voters making less than $30,000, and 51 percent of voters making between $31,000 and $50,000, and lost every income class above that. Their most lopsided defeat came among voters making more than $100,000 — they gave 57 percent of their votes to Republicans.</p> \n<p> </p> \n<center> <img src=""http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2451146/vote_income_2014.0.jpg"" alt=""vote income 2014"" data-chorus-asset-id=""2451146""> \n<p class=""caption""><a href=""http://www.cnn.com/election/2014/results/race/house#exit-polls"">CNN</a></p> \n</center> \n<p><b style=""line-height: 1.5;"">5) Leonhardt's main advice to Democrats is to run ""probably the oldest and most obvious play in the book: a tax cut."" </b><span>He notes that in 2008, Barack Obama ran on a bigger middle-class tax cut than John McCain, and ""by the campaign's end, polls showed that many voters understood this fact  —  and viewed the Democrats as the party of tax cuts."" But I think the telling point comes in the aftermath: in office, Obama passed that tax cut  —  and more tax cuts —  and then Democrats got destroyed in the 2010 election. So it's not clear that middle-class tax cuts are much of a salve.</span></p> \n<h3>The hardest question in American politics</h3> \n<p>The question Leonhardt is trying to answer here is perhaps the most significant one in politics: why are election outcomes so volatile in recent years? What can we say about an electorate that voted overwhelmingly for Democrats in 2006, 2008 and 2012, and overwhelmingly for Republicans in 2004, 2010, and 2014? Party control in Congress has flipped more often in recent years than at anytime since the immediate aftermath of World War II. What are the voters trying to say?</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""center""><span>though the electorate's midterm judgments against Obama have been brutal, they are not unprecedented</span></q></p> \n<p>I suspect the answer has more to do with structural changes in American politics than with the mood of the electorate. Voter opinion seesawed in previous decades, too, but for various reasons, control of Congress wasn't as closely divided, and so didn't change hands as often. This chart — which remains incomplete for 2014, because some Senate races haven't been called yet — shows that though the electorate's midterm judgments against Obama have been brutal, they are not really unprecedented:</p> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""2451058"" alt=""structural_penalty_and_approval_rating.0.0.png"" src=""http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2451058/structural_penalty_and_approval_rating.0.0.png""></p> \n<p>But the truest answer I can give to the question of what the voters are saying is: I don't know. And I'm not even sure the question makes sense.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""center""><span>Who ""the voters"" are changes election-to-election</span></q></p> \n<p>Who ""the voters"" are changes election-to-election, and one of the primary contributors to the swings seems to be that a more Democratic group of ""the voters"" turn out in presidential elections and a more Republican group of ""the voters"" turns out in midterm elections and this seems to be happening regardless of what's going on in the economy.</p> \n<p>Another way of putting this: The 2014 electorate looked a lot more like the 2010 electorate than like the 2012 electorate even though the 2014 economy looks a lot more like the 2012 economy than the 2010 economy.</p> \n<p><span>Which isn't to say that Leonhardt is wrong that a middle-class tax cut is a good idea right now, or even that slow wage growth is putting pressure on American politics.

It's also something of a shock: for a long time, the US-China rivalry had been a major stumbling block in the way of an international agreement on global warming. What happened?</p> \n<p>Essentially, the US and China started talking on their own. Tension between the US and China has helped ruin the UN global climate talks, the main attempt to reach a worldwide accord<span>. But now these secret bilateral negotiations between the two powers have helped break a major part of the trap US-China conflict had created for global negotiations. The reason bilateral US-China negotiations have worked better has to do with changes in both countries — as well as the weird frenemy character of the US-China relationship itself.</span></p> \n<h3>How US-China competition wrecked a climate agreement</h3> \n<p><img src=""http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2451848/470902677.0.jpg"" alt=""US-China military leaders "" data-chorus-asset-id=""2451848""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">US army Chief of Staff General Ray Odierno meets with Fan Changlong, Deputy Chaiman of the Central Military Commission at the Bayi Building in Beijing. (Lintao Zhang/AFP/Getty Images)</p> \n<p>The United States and China need one another. For a variety of reasons that extend beyond just trade ties, the American and Chinese economies are closely linked, and both benefit if the other does well. So the two need to cooperate to manage the global economy.</p> \n<p>But US-Sino tensions run deep. In the immediate term, China wants to expand its influence over East Asian countries, while the US has arranged a coalition including South Korea and Japan to limit that. In the longer term, the US is worried about China challenging American global leadership, while China's leaders have <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/11/12/7203263/obama-china-climate"">long believed</a> the United States is working to undermine their regime. So, despite some necessary levels of cooperation, the two countries still see one another as competitors.</p> \n<p>Climate change negotiations have <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/11/12/7203263/obama-china-climate"">reflected this frenemy dynamic</a>.

Neither country really trusted the other to follow through on emissions reductions, and so neither was willing to commit to a binding agreement unless the other committed first.</span></p> \n<p><span>This matters for more than just the US and China: it matters for any global climate efforts. Getting buy-in from both the United States and China is necessary, if not sufficient, for any wider UN agreement. No global accord on climate change could really work so long as the two largest emitters refused to sign on. </span></p> \n<p><span></span><span>""This US-Chinese ‘game of chicken' held back serious negotiations in the past,"" Robert Falkner, an expert on international climate negotiations at the</span><span> </span><span>London School of Economics</span><span>, </span><a target=""_blank"" href=""http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/politicsandpolicy/tough-trade-offs-on-the-road-to-paris-what-hopes-for-a-2015-climate-agreement/"" style=""line-height: 1.5; background-color: #ffffff;"">writes</a><span>.

(Feng Li/Getty Images)</p> \n<p>Two key factors helped make these bilateral negotiations more successful than the multilateral summits that came before them. First, both countries got serious on climate change at home. Second, the bilateral character of negotiations helped on its own.</p> \n<p>In the United States, President Obama gave up his first-term push for new climate legislation and simply acted. In June, the president used the EPA's Clean Air Act powers to <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/6/1/5770556/EPA-power-plant-rules-explainer"">cut emissions</a> from domestic power plants in June. The plan cuts US emissions levels from power plants to <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/6/1/5770556/EPA-power-plant-rules-explainer"">about 30 percent below 2005 levels by 2030</a>, making it one of the Obama administration's most important domestic accomplishments on climate change.</p> \n<p>The Chinese government, rightly concerned about political unrest stemming from China's <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2014/05/29/my_name_is_china_and_i_have_a_pollution_environment_problem"">disastrous pollution problems</a>, has also geared up. ""The country's 12th Five-Year Plan adopted in 2011 already contains a large section with policies on reducing energy and carbon intensity in the economy, increasing non-fossil energy as part of the energy mix and establishing a carbon trading system,"" Falkner writes. After that announcement, Falkner argues, China's commitment to addressing climate change has only escalated — including signaling greater public openness to an international agreement.</p> \n<p>So by 2014, both countries had shown willingness to act on their own. But to get an agreement, the next crucial step was talking to each other directly — before the onset of formal UN negotiations.</p> \n<p><q class=""right"" aria-hidden=""true"">The non-binding US-China deal doesn't have to satisfy India or Brazil</q></p> \n<p>The UN climate talks were caught in a sort of catch-22. No agreement would ever work unless the US and China both signed on. But UN summits made it hard for the two countries to join the same platform. For one thing, the UN process was aiming for an agreement that would create binding international law, whereas the joint US-China plan is non-binding. Non-binding agreements are much easier to work out.</p> \n<p>For another, other countries who were party to the talks have other priorities. ""Countries such as China and India, but also Brazil and South Africa, are now playing a more assertive role in international negotiations and are equally reluctant to sign on to binding international commitments,"" Falkner <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://static.squarespace.com/static/538a0f32e4b0e9ab915750a1/t/538db535e4b0f4bbdccb7062/1401795893518/Falkner_2013_Environmental_Multilateralism.pdf"">writes</a>. These newly aggressive countries have ""increased the number of veto players in international negotiations,"" meaning that the US and China had to work out any eventual deal with a variety of other countries, each with their own interests.</p> \n<p>The non-binding US-China deal doesn't have to satisfy India or Brazil. The US and China worked out their own issues, getting an important preliminary agreement in place before being confronted with the broader international problem.</p> \n<h3>Can the US-China agreement push the rest of the world forward?</h3> \n<p><img src=""http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/1395952/455905110.0.jpg"" alt=""brazil climate protest"" data-chorus-asset-id=""1395952""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">A climate rally in Rio de Janeiro on September 21, 2014. (Thiago Ripper/Pacific Press/LightRocket via Getty Images)</p> \n<p>Falkner calls this agreement a ""<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://twitter.com/robert_falkner/status/532501808938504192"">game changer</a>,"" and for good reason. The agreement is a big deal on its own terms, but it also makes a future multilateral agreement more likely. US-China cooperation on climate breeds cooperation.</p> \n<p>Ideally, the US and China will go into the 2015 UN meetings with a shared vision for a strong treaty. Falkner believes that a ""US-Chinese agreement on the main parameters of a future climate treaty could unblock the international negotiations,"" as it would send a very strong signal to the rest of the world that this round of negotiations is different from the <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/8/28/6075433/global-climate-talks-paris-2015"">somewhat less serious efforts in the past</a>.</p> \n<p>However, even that doesn't guarantee a new climate treaty. ""If the US and China agree to an international agreement with commitments to emission reductions, they will insist that these commitments are made in the form of non-binding pledges,"" Falkner concludes. ""Other countries will find it difficult to agree to a treaty architecture that leaves countries to determine their own level of ambition.""</p> \n<p>However, this is something of a happy problem to have, as far as international climate politics goes. For years, rivalry between the United States and China torpedoed international agreements on climate change.

But if the GOP sees an opportunity to embarrass Obama by joining a left-right pincers movement against Weiss, he might well go down.</p> \n<p>The general theory that people with industry experience make for more bank-friendly regulators is popular, but somewhat lacking in evidence. Former Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner, broadly viewed as Obama's most bank-friendly employee, was a career civil servant with no background on Wall Street. Former CFTC Chair Gary Gensler, generally the Obama appointee who took the toughest line on bank regulation, was a longtime Goldman Sachs guy before joining the government.

Here are the basics of how the existing DACA program works — which might help explain how Obama's new executive actions are going to work.</p> \n<p>(For a deeper look at the DACA program, see <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/8/18/5999601/deferred-action-obama-immigration-daca"">my feature</a> from this summer.)</p> \n<h3>What is the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program?</h3> \n<p>Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, is a program the federal government launched in 2012. It allows young unauthorized immigrants who meet certain criteria to apply for a commitment from the Obama administration for ""deferred action"" — that is, a commitment not to initiate deportation proceedings against the applicant — for two years. Successful applicants also receive a work permit.</p> \n<p>The administration created DACA as a way to protect unauthorized immigrants who would have gotten legal status if the DREAM Act had passed Congress in 2010. (It passed the House, but failed to pass the 60-vote threshold for cloture in the Senate.)</p> \n<p>Obama and immigration officials in his administration had been saying for years that they would not deport unauthorized immigrant students. But federal immigration agents weren't getting the memo. So the administration stopped relying on passive protection from deportation, and allowed ""DREAMers"" to apply for protection themselves. (If you're confused by this distinction, see my article <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/11/16/7226621/obama-executive-action-immigration-deportations-amnesty"" target=""_blank"">here</a>, which explains it in more detail.)</p> \n<p><img src=""http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/653520/150318941__1_.0.jpg"" alt=""daca clinic"" data-chorus-asset-id=""653520""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">People attend an orientation class in filing up their application for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program</p> \n<h3><span>Does deferred action make someone legal?</span></h3> \n<p>No. Under deferred action, <span>an immigrant has a certain amount of time during which he or she won't be deported. Deferred action also g</span>ives immigrants a number of important benefits, including the ability to get a work permit, a driver's license (in most states), etc.</p> \n<p><span>But deferred action is temporary, and must be renewed. </span>Often in the past, the period before renewal was one year; under DACA, it's two years.<span> At the end of that time, the deferred action can be renewed. </span></p> \n<p><span>And</span><span> DACA recipients don't receive what's known as legal status — and that means they aren't given a path </span><span>toward a green card and eventual citizenship.</span></p> \n<h3>What are the requirements for DACA?</h3> \n<p style=""font-size: 14.6666669845581px;"">DACA was designed to help immigrants who would have qualified for the DREAM Act — young unauthorized immigrants who'd come to the US as children, and were in or graduates from college.

So it's only been partly successful in reaching the population it's intended to reach.</p> \n<p>But for the people who have received DACA, it's been a big success — removing the fear of deportation, and emboldening them to take leadership roles in the community. For a closer look at how the DACA program has worked so far, read <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/8/18/5999601/deferred-action-obama-immigration-daca"" target=""_blank"">my feature on DACA </a>from August.</p> \n<h3>Why is DACA controversial?</h3> \n<p>When DACA was first announced in 2012, many Republicans were critical of it — saying that President Obama should be waiting for Congress to make its wishes known on immigration, rather than protecting people Congress hadn't decided to give legal status to. But most of those criticisms were muted. Mitt Romney, then the Republican nominee for President, avoided giving an opinion on the program for several months — and then declared that while he'd stop new people from applying for protection, he wouldn't strip protection away from anyone who'd already received DACA.</p> \n<p>But as Congress debated whether and how to pass immigration reform bills in 2013, DACA became a target for conservatives who supported maximal immigration enforcement, including the principle of <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/11/16/7226621/obama-executive-action-immigration-deportations-amnesty"" target=""_blank"">""random deportations.""</a> And it became even more controversial in 2014, after it became clear that Congress <i>wasn't </i>going to pass immigration reform, and that President Obama might be expanding deferred action to a larger group of immigrants. Part of the controversy over DACA now is tied to conservative opposition to the broader executive action the president is expected to take at the end of 2014.</p> \n<p><img src=""http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/assets/4698267/74640684.jpg"" alt=""anti-immigrant protester"" data-chorus-asset-id=""647022""></p> \n<h3>What have Republicans done to try to stop DACA?</h3> \n<p>It's a little tricky to ""defund"" DACA, because US Citizenship and Immigration Services — the agency that runs the program — is funded almost entirely by application fees rather than by taxes. (To apply for DACA, immigrants <a href=""http://www.uscis.gov/humanitarian/consideration-deferred-action-childhood-arrivals-daca"" target=""_blank"">have to pay $465</a> — and they have to pay the same amount two years later to renew it.)</p> \n<p>However, House Republicans have tried to put conditions on a few government funding bills that would simply prohibit the Obama administration from continuing to implement DACA. In one iteration of this, passed by the House in 2013, the administration wouldn't be able to implement any of its prosecutorial discretion policies to limit deportation — even by passively deciding not to deport certain categories of immigrants. In <a href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/gop-border-crisis-plan-vote-boehner-conservatives-2014-8"" target=""_blank"">another iteration,</a> passed by the House in 2014 as part of its response to the child-migrant crisis, the government would be prohibited from issuing DACA protections to any new applicants — including current recipients who'd need to renew their DACA grants after two years.</p>",Politics

Just such a plan sprang out of conservative think tanks and was tested by a GOP governor in Massachusetts, Mitt Romney.</p> \n<p>Instead of a bipartisan agreement to bring that plan to scale, we got more partisan warfare.

It is true that the GOP resisted. It is true that the law is unpopular. But Obama didn't surrender his mantle of bipartisanship. The GOP took it away from him. They took it away from his as part of a <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/11/4/7158293/mitch-mcconnell-strategist"" target=""_blank"">deliberate strategy</a>. They knew, as Fournier says right in this very column, that a big bipartisan health reform would be more popular than a big partisan health reform. So since Republicans didn't want Obama to be popular, they had every incentive to refuse to reach a bipartisan agreement. And thus no agreement was reached.</p> \n<p>But regardless of the process used to get there, Obama and congressional Democrats delivered <i>exactly</i> the kind of reform Fournier says America needed.

The president would like to be associated with bipartisan initiatives. The opposition party would like the president to <i>not</i> be associated with bipartisan initiatives. And the opposition party has it in their power to <i>make sure</i> that the president is not associated with bipartisan initiatives.</p> \n<p>If you don't understand that, you'll never understand today's politics. Worse, you'll be consistently making bipartisanship less likely. It's precisely because of columns like this one that it made narrow political sense for the GOP to abjure compromise.

But there's a bit of confusion over how many millions that is.</p> \n<p>Obama's upcoming plan is being characterized, in advance, as relief for 5 million unauthorized immigrants. But based on the rumors about who'd be likely to be included in the plan, that's not exactly accurate.</p> \n<p><img src=""http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2468126/deportation_relief_chart.0.png"" alt=""deportation relief estimates"" data-chorus-asset-id=""2468126""></p> \n<p>What it looks like is that, by the time Obama's new plan goes into effect, 5 million unauthorized immigrants, <i>in total, </i>will be eligible to apply for protection from deportation. That includes immigrants who are <i>already </i>eligible for protection — even before any new plan is announced — because they qualify for the <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/obama-immigration-executive-action-amnesty-congress/what-is-daca-obama-deferred-action-dreamers-immigration"">Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program,</a> which the Obama administration introduced in 2012.</p> \n<h3>Who's likely to be eligible for deportation relief?</h3> \n<p>Here's how the <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/11/15/us/politics/obama-immigration-plan-could-affect-millions.html"">New York Times</a>, which reported Obama's rumored plan last week, broke it down, using data from the <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.migrationpolicy.org/research/executive-action-unauthorized-immigrants-estimates-populations-could-receive-relief"">Migration Policy Institute</a>:</p> \n<ul> \n<li><span><b>Currently eligible for deferred action: about 1.2 million. </b>Under the Obama administration's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, young unauthorized immigrants who came to the US as children can apply for protection from deportation. So far, about 600,000 immigrants have received protection under DACA — but it's estimated that 1.2 million immigrants are eligible, and that about half of them just haven't applied.</span></li> \n<li><span><b>Expansions to the existing DACA program: up to 700,000. </b>According to the Times, one of the options that the Obama administration is considering is changing the standards to be eligible for DACA. Right now, no one who came to the US after 2007 is eligible for DACA; the administration could change that to 2011. Similarly, no one who came to the US when they were older than 15 is currently eligible for DACA; the administration could change the cut-off date to anyone older than 17. Those two changes, combined, would make an additional 700,000 people eligible to apply for DACA.</span></li> \n<li> <span><b>A new program granting relief to parents: 2.5 million-3.4 million, depending on scope. </b>The centerpiece of the administration's expected plan is a program that would protect unauthorized immigrant parents of US citizens or green-card holders from deportation, and allow them to seek work permits. If the program is limited to parents who've been in the US for ten years (since 2004), the Times estimates that about 2.5 million immigrants would be eligible for relief. But if the program applies to parents who've been in the US for at least <i>five </i>years (since 2009), then 3.3 million immigrants would be eligible. And if parents of DACA-eligible young people are included, 3.4 million immigrants would be eligible.</span> </li> \n</ul> \n<p>So in total, it sounds like Obama's plan will affect up to 4 million unauthorized immigrants. But including the immigrants who are already eligible for protection, by the time this new proposal goes into effect, 5 million of the nation's 11.7 million unauthorized immigrants would be eligible to seek protection.</p>",Politics
The best conservative argument for another government shutdown,http://www.vox.com/2014/11/19/7242987/erickson-shutdown,"If the last one didn't hurt the GOP, why would another be any different?","<p>An important new argument is gaining traction on the right about the wisdom of a government shutdown over Obama taking executive action over immigration. This argument <i>doesn't</i> say that ""this time will be different"" and congressional Republicans will evade blame for a shutdown.  Instead, activist Erick Erickson <a href=""http://www.redstate.com/2014/11/18/shut-it-down/"">points out</a> that conservatives won a huge landslide in 2014 <i>even though</i> voters blamed them for the 2013 shutdown. Indeed, he argues that the 1995 shutdown went fine, too.</p> \n<p>""Again,"" he writes, ""after the shutdown [in] the Clinton years, the GOP picked up Senate seats."" And on Election Day this year we saw ""a wave of such magnitude it is pretty hard to claim that if only the Congress had not shut down the wave would have been longer.""</p> \n<p>Erickson concludes that there's no reason for Republicans to fear a shutdown this fall.</p> \n<p>Thus, he concludes, the GOP should pass appropriations containing ""everything except Obamacare funding and funding for any immigration actions the President wants to take."" And this time they should stick to their guns: ""when he shuts down the government, keep it shut till you have your way and then hold public hearings to show how Obama selectively shut things down to hurt the voters intentionally.""</p> \n<p>After all, the GOP lost the messaging war last time around and nonetheless ""the public rewarded them with the biggest election wave in modern American political history from the local level to the federal level.""</p> \n<p>I think you have to admit that there's something pretty persuasive about this. The 2013 shutdown was a total debacle for Republicans, except there was no objective price to pay. Public opinion moves relatively quickly. And an American president doesn't have the authority to call a ""snap"" election if his legislative opponents become temporarily unpopular. The shutdown was  forgiven and forgotten by the voters long before Election Day. So if you're purely concerned about the electoral politics of the thing, it doesn't seem like a shutdown this winter would do Republicans any harm.</p>",Politics

Though it's not certain that Webb will run in the end, the move shows he's quite seriously considering it. </li> \n</ol> \n<h3>Webb's announcement video</h3> \n<p>On Wednesday night, former Senator James Webb (D-VA) sent a <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oV3RnBaXIlk"">14-minute video</a> to supporters announcing that he had opened an exploratory campaign to consider a presidential run, and asking for donations.</p> \n<p><span>""Is it possible for us to return to a leadership environment where people from both political parties and both philosophical points of view feel compelled to work together for the common good and to sort out their disagreements in a way that moves our country forward rather than tearing the fabric of this nation apart?"" Webb asked. ""As one who spent four years in the Reagan administration and then served in the Senate as a Democrat, I believe it is possible. It is also necessary.""</span></p> \n<h3>A bipartisan background</h3> \n<p>Webb, a decorated Vietnam War veteran, worked as a Congressional staffer, and then in President Reagan's Defense Department, where he rose to become Secretary of the Navy. He <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://articles.latimes.com/1988-02-23/news/mn-44732_1_navy-secretary"">resigned</a> from that position in 1988 in protest of budget cuts. Afterward, he worked as an author and a filmmaker, and went back and forth between supporting candidates from both major parties.</p> \n<p>But Webb's frustration with President George W. Bush's war in Iraq eventually led him to choose a side — and he ran for a US Senate seat in Virginia as a Democrat in 2006. He won a narrow victory over incumbent Senator George Allen (R), helping the party retake the chamber that year. After serving out his term, though, Webb decided not to run again in 2012.</p> \n<h3>An economic critique of the Democratic Party</h3> \n<p>In the video, Webb mentioned poverty and stagnation affecting Americans from the inner cities to the Appalachian mountains, while mentioning that the average CEO now made greater than 300 times what his worker made. <span>""The inequalities between top and bottom in our country are greater than at any time in the last hundred years,"" Webb said. </span><span>""We cannot sit idly by and suggest that such economic power divisions are permanent.""</span></p> \n<p><span>He went on: ""The Democratic Party used to be the place where people like this could come not for a handout but for a respectable handshake. Good full-time jobs, quality education, health care they could afford, and the vital overriding reassurance that we are all in this together and that the system is not rigged in favor of one group of people and against another. We can get there again.""</span></p> \n<p>In a <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/11/17/inevitability-trap"">recent interview</a> with the New Yorker's Ryan Lizza, Webb elaborated on his critique of the party on economic issues:</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>""There is a big tendency among a lot of Democratic leaders to feed some raw meat to the public on smaller issues that excite them, like the minimum wage, but don't really address the larger problem,"" Webb said. ""A lot of the Democratic leaders who don't want to scare away their financial supporters will say we're going to raise the minimum wage, we're going do these little things, when in reality we need to say we're going to fundamentally change the tax code so that you will believe our system is fair.""</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p><span>Webb's skepticism of military interventionism would surely also be a major element of his campaign. In his video, he critiqued </span><span>""ill-considered foreign ventures that have drained trillions from our economy and brought instability instead of deterrence."" The implied contrast to Hillary Clinton, who was a key proponent of Obama's 2009 troop surge in Afghanistan and proposed arming Syrian rebels, is clear.</span></p> \n<h3>Webb's pitch</h3> \n<p>In the video, Webb acknowledged that he's facing <span>""what many commentators consider nearly impossible odds."" Indeed, Hillary Clinton has a gigantic lead </span><span>in </span><a href=""http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/2016_democratic_presidential_nomination-3824.html"" target=""_blank"">the polls</a><span>, and will likely win the support of nearly every major Democratic party figure and interest group.</span></p> \n<p>Webb is hoping that his actual record of bipartisanship, combined with a potent policy critique of the party, will convince both moderate and liberal Democratic voters to gravitate to him instead.</p> \n<p><span>""With enough financial support to conduct a first-class campaign, I have no doubt that we can put these issues squarely before the American people and gain their support,"" he said. Depending on the success of his exploratory committee, he'll likely decide on a run at the end of this year or in early 2015.</span></p>",Politics

President George H.W. Bush granted <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/11/20/7254361/family-fairness-immigration"">about 1.4 million unauthorized immigrants</a>a blanket deferral from deportation — that was about 40 percent of America's unauthorized population, a number similar to what Obama is considering now.

The argument here is that the constant, unrelenting fear of deportation is part of the punishment for immigration and living in the US illegally. It might be unwise for the US to to expend the resources necessary to find and deport all 11 million unauthorized immigrants, but it's foolhardy for the US to free them from the threat of deportation — that would simply reward their decision to enter the country in violation of its laws, and send a worrying signal to others thinking about following their lead.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""center"">This is the view at the heart of Mitt Romney's self-deportation idea</q></p> \n<p>While it was seen as a gaffe at the time, this is the heart of Mitt Romney's ""<a href=""http://"">self-deportation</a>"" idea: he was arguing that living as an unauthorized immigrant in the US should be such a tenuous, unpleasant existence that people leave of their own volition rather than requiring the government to deport them. This is an idea with <a href=""http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/01/24/romneys-plan-for-self-deportation-has-conservative-support/"">a lot of support</a> in the conservative world, and Obama's executive action is a direct rejection of it.</p> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""2406246"" alt=""capitol cones"" src=""http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2406246/465639243.0.jpg""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Mark Wilson/Getty Images</p> \n<h3>\n<i>For:</i> Congress is broken, and that means the president must do more</h3> \n<p>Few disagree at this point that Congress is increasingly <a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/congressional-dysfunction/what-is-congressional-dysfunction"">dysfunctional</a> and <a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/congressional-dysfunction/is-congress-less-productive-than-is-used-to-be"">paralyzed</a> — and is likely to remain that way for some time. The question, then, is this: is it helpful or harmful for the president to respond to a structural decrease in congressional action with a structural increase in executive action?</p> \n<p>This is, arguably, one way the system can adjust to gridlock: if Congress does less, the executive will have to do more. Perhaps a gridlocked legislature makes a more powerful executive necessary. Maybe Obama's actions are healthy for the system. Maybe it's a necessary adaptation to gridlock.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""center""><span>if Congress does less, the executive will have to do more</span></q></p> \n<p>""We are operating in what amounts to a parliamentary system without majority rule, a formula for futility,"" <a href=""http://www.nationaljournal.com/njmagazine/nj_20100123_5664.php"">wrote</a> Ron Brownstein in 2010. Perhaps this is a way American politics becomes a little more parliamentary. Congress can, in both this case and most of the hypothetical cases, remove the president's authority to act unilaterally. But insofar as it doesn't, we're creating a system where, in many cases, the tie goes to the executive — and then the electorate can judge the executive based on his actions.</p> \n<p>A related argument is that this might help break congressional gridlock. As the executive branch begins to do more, members of Congress will want to recapture their rightful role as the engine of federal action — and they will decide that compromise is less painful than irrelevance.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""center""><span>this might help break congressional gridlock</span></q></p> \n<p>This is, clearly, what Obama hopes will happen. He has continually called on Congress to preempt his action on immigration by passing a law of their own. It won’t happen this time — the injustice feels too raw to Republicans, and Obama’s demand sounds too much like blackmail — but it might eventually<b> </b>happen if Congress recognizes that its dysfunction is leading to an ongoing deterioration in its power.</p> \n<h3>\n<i>Against:</i> This could turn paralysis into crisis</h3> \n<p>In some ways, the precedents and the legality are beside the point — Republicans really do believe that Obama would be ushering in a new norm of unchecked executive power. The response would either be brinksmanship now, reprisal later, or perhaps both. ""The Democrats are fighting dirty, which means this is no time for Marquess of Queensberry rules,"" <a href=""http://thefederalist.com/2014/11/18/republicans-should-embrace-the-obama-rule/"">writes</a> Gabriel Malor, a conservative pundit.</p> \n<p>So while this might be one way the system manages the consequences of extended gridlock, it might also be a way that gridlock becomes a genuine constitutional crisis. Routine high-stakes showdowns between the executive and the opposing party in Congress could lead to frequent government shutdowns, impeachment proceedings, and perhaps even a breach of the debt ceiling.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""center""><span>a more powerful president might mean a more irresponsible Congress</span></q></p> \n<p>Moreover, a more powerful president might mean a more irresponsible Congress — that, arguably, is what’s happened on national security, where Congress long ago gave much of its power to the executive, and has never seemed particularly interested in getting it back.</p> \n<p>Ross Douthat, for once, recognizes the structural case for this action — but nevertheless <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/16/opinion/sunday/ross-douthat-the-great-immigration-betrayal.html"">counsels</a> against it. ""Presidential systems like ours have a long record, especially in Latin America, of producing standoffs between executive and legislative branches, which tends to make executive power grabs more likely. In the United States this tendency has been less dangerous — our imperial presidency has grown on us gradually; the worst overreaches have often been rolled back. But we do seem to be in an era whose various forces — our open-ended post-9/11 wars, the ideological uniformity of the parties — are making a kind of creeping caudillismo more likely. But if that evil must come, woe to the president who chooses it.""</p> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""696942"" alt=""immigration protestor"" src=""http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/696942/166236958.0.jpg""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">SAUL LOEB/AFP/Getty Images</p> \n<h3>Where do I fall?</h3> \n<p>I've tried, in this piece, to present the arguments for and against Obama's possible executive action as fairly as I could. But it seems like a dodge to end without saying where I'm leaning.</p> \n<p>President Obama appears to have the legal authority to make this move. And I'm unconvinced by the cries that he must tailor his agenda because of an election where he wasn't even on the ballot. Where were these voices when Republicans responded to the 2008 election with a relentless campaign of obstruction against the stimulus, the Affordable Care Act, and Dodd-Frank? Where were they after the 2012 election? The judgment of the electorate cannot be binding on one party but not the other. On this, the recent political norm is clear: parties are free to pursue their agendas even after poor showings in national elections.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""center""><span>The judgment of the electorate cannot be binding on one party but not the other</span></q></p> \n<p>Similarly, while I think the logic of keeping unauthorized immigrants in a constant state of terror is sound, I also think it's cruel and counterproductive. These are people who live here, work here, pay taxes here, and raise families here. And, to repeat, <i>these are people</i>. If we are not going to deport them we should stop pretending otherwise. Helping them out of the shadows would be good for the economy, good for the country, and good for them. It's the right thing to do. And while it should be done through a law giving them a path to citizenship, it is better done through executive action than not at all.</p> \n<p>Where I struggle is with the final pair of arguments. I think Democrats underestimate how much Obama has <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/9/9/5964421/obama-lawsuit-republicans-abuse-of-power"">already done to expand executive power</a>. And while I do think party polarization and the resulting structural gridlock are a deep problem for the nation, that doesn't mean that the majority party can't respond in ways that will create worse crises. I feel much more comfortable with the Senate <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/11/19/7247175/mcconnell-abolish-filibuster"">abolishing the filibuster</a> than with the president becoming routinely creative with executive authority.</p> \n<p>I've seen people quoting the old Nixon line, ""When the president does it, that means that it's not illegal."" But that's not the problem here. The real issue is that just because it's legal doesn't make it wise.</p> \n<p>The other side of the argument, though, is that this is a crisis that is, in part, about the GOP's response. When President George H.W. Bush did something similar, Democrats didn't go to war. And it isn't obvious to me that the way the system should work is gridlock in Congress and, where gridlock is not sufficiently effective at pouring cement into the gears of government, threats of crisis and reprisal if the president uses the authority he (or she) possesses. At some point, extended paralysis — enforced by the threat of manufactured disaster — becomes its own crisis.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""center""><span>At some point, extended paralysis becomes its own crisis</span></q></p> \n<p>Nor are the threats of reprisal — many of which focus on tax and environmental policy — so convincing. President George W. Bush cut the number of IRS agents auditing estate tax abuses. One estate tax lawyer <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/23/business/23tax.html"">described</a> the action to the New York Times as a ""back-door way for the Bush administration to achieve what it cannot get from Congress, which is repeal of the estate tax."" At another point, the Bush administration evaded responsibility for regulating carbon emissions by <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/25/washington/25epa.html?_r=0"">refusing to open </a>a legally important e-mail. That's not to say future Republicans presidents can't be more brazen, or come up with ways to go further — but who's to say they won't do it anyway?</p> \n<p>I don't think this is an easy decision. It requires judgment calls on not just the policy and the underlying laws Obama is citing, but on the political system's likely response to Obama's actions. At the beginning of this section, I said I would make clear where I'm leaning, and leaning really is the right word. Three days a week I lean towards the policy. Four days a week I lean against it. I'm hoping, as the specifics of the policy are rolled out over the next few days, to see or hear something that makes this a clearer call.</p>",Politics
Did George H.W. Bush really pave the way for Obama on immigration?,http://www.vox.com/2014/11/20/7254361/family-fairness-immigration,The precedent Obama's using for executive action: a 1990 program called Family Fairness,"<p>President Obama's supporters are justifying his coming executive action on immigration by turning to an unlikely argument: Bush did it.</p> \n<p>No, not that Bush.</p> \n<p>They're pointing to a program started by President Reagan, and expanded by President George H. W. Bush, that ultimately targeted over a third of the country's unauthorized immigrants for protection from deportation. It was called the Family Fairness Program and it's probably the closest analogue in recent presidential history to what Obama is considering now. Here's how it worked.</p> \n<h3>What was the Family Fairness program?</h3> \n<p><img src=""http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2475298/3238485.0.jpg"" alt=""George HW Bush gesture"" data-chorus-asset-id=""2475298""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">That gesture looks like ""fairness,"" right? (Ron Sachs/Hutton via Getty)</p> \n<p>After the <a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/immigration-immigrants-reform-us/what-did-the-1986-immigration-reform-bill-do"">Immigration Reform and Control Act (IRCA)</a> passed in 1986, about 2.7 million previously-unauthorized immigrants were able to apply for legal status, which they could ultimately turn into green cards and eventual citizenship. But there were strict requirements about who could get legalized: most importantly, immigrants had to have been in the US since 1982. And that meant some members of families were eligible while others weren't. If an immigrant who was eligible for legalization under IRCA had a spouse or a child who wasn't eligible, the spouse or child was out of luck.</p> \n<p>This struck many — including Reagan — as unfair. The year after IRCA passed, President Reagan took executive action to keep some of those spouses and kids from getting deported. Reagan said that children who had two parents who were legalizing, or were being raised by a single parent who was legalizing, could get something called ""extended voluntary departure"" — basically a grant of protection from deportation with a work permit, similar to what the Deferred Action For Childhood Arrivals program (DACA, protecting ""DREAMers"") uses today. And in particular cases, spouses of IRCA beneficiaries could apply, too.</p> \n<p>In 1990, President George H.W. Bush expanded the program, to allow any child or spouse of someone who was getting legalized through IRCA to apply for extended voluntary departure. That expansion made it much broader than the original program.</p> \n<p>Bush gave the program a new name: Family Fairness. That's the action that is most comparable to Obama's actions now.</p> \n<h3>What was the justification for Bush's action?</h3> \n<p> </p> \n<p>George H.W. Bush's executive action had a similar rationale to Obama's: once adults get citizenship or citizens become adults, they're able to apply for their family members to<a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/immigration-immigrants-reform-us/how-does-legal-immigration-work-right-now""> immigrate legally</a> to the US. So in both cases, executive action covers people who are going to be eligible for legal status eventually — but are currently at risk of being deported. For Bush, it was the spouses and children of amnesty recipients who'd gotten legal status, but not citizenship; for Obama, it's the parents of native-born US citizens who just can't sponsor their parents until they turn 21.</p> \n<p>If Obama, <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/10/30/7131905/obama-immigration-reform-how-what-immigrants-millions-plan"">as expected,</a> focuses the new deferred action program on parents of US citizens or green card holders, it will be a mirror image of the Bush program: Bush protected children on behalf of their parents, whereas Obama will protect parents on behalf of their children.</p> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""638940"" alt=""New American family"" src=""http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/assets/4413913/160338946.jpg"" style=""font-size: 17.3333339691162px; line-height: 37.9500007629395px;""></p> \n<h3>Did Bush protect as many immigrants as Obama's going to?</h3> \n<p>This is tricky — partly because no one knows how many people will actually apply for the program Obama's set to create.

But there were fewer unauthorized immigrants, <i>period</i>, in 1990 — in part because about 3 million immigrants had been legalized through the Reagan amnesty just a few years earlier.</p> \n<p>In 1990, the total unauthorized population of the US was about <a href=""https://www.dhs.gov/xlibrary/assets/statistics/publications/Ill_Report_1211.pdf"">3.5 million</a>. So Bush's executive action protected about 40 percent of America's unauthorized immigrants at the time. That's roughly comparable to the action Obama is expected to take, covering 4 million of the nation's 11 million unauthorized immigrants (although including the people who've already been granted deferred action through the DACA program, Obama's actions ultimately protect a slightly higher 5 million).</p> \n<p>It's worth noting unauthorized immigrants in 1990 weren't at as much risk of deportation. Only 30,000 immigrants were formally <a href=""https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.vox.com/2014/4/11/5602272/removals-returns-and-deportations-a-very-short-history-of-immigration&amp;sa=U&amp;ei=9AJuVJ2QAu_vigKUzIGYBQ&amp;ved=0CAYQFjAA&amp;client=internal-uds-cse&amp;usg=AFQjCNFliuzMVw3I_PUhhoFxIHqR6SKETA"">removed</a> from the US in 1990 — less than one percent of the unauthorized population. And it's reasonable to assume that few of those were children.</p> \n<p>During the first several years of the Obama administration, 400,000 unauthorized immigrants were removed every year — about 3.6 percent of the total unauthorized population. That included tens of thousands of parents of US citizens — the very group being protected by Obama's upcoming action. In 2013, <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/06/25/parents-deportation_n_5531552.html"">about 72,000</a> parents of US citizens were deported —  a slight decrease from <a href=""http://colorlines.com/archives/2012/12/deportations_of_parents_of_us-born_citizens_122012.html"">the year before.</a></p> \n<h3>Was Congress on board?</h3> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""2475274"" alt=""congress 1990"" src=""http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2475274/162033787.0.jpg""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">They couldn't bother to vote on it until afterwards. (Duane Howell/Denver Post via Getty)</p> \n<p>Some conservatives, including Gabriel Malor of <a href=""http://thefederalist.com/2014/11/20/no-reagan-did-not-offer-an-amnesty-by-lawless-executive-order/"" target=""_blank"">the Federalist, </a>have said that Congress just made a mistake in 1986 when it passed the Reagan immigration bill. They didn't <i>mean </i>to leave out spouses and children, they just ""had not considered and not included"" them. So Reagan, and Bush after him, were just dealing with unintended consequences of a bill Congress had recently passed — making it different from Obama's actions today.</p> \n<p>That's in line with how Sen. Chuck Schumer, a Democrat, characterized the law in 1987;<a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.nytimes.com/1987/10/22/us/us-may-let-some-illegals-stay-if-relatives-qualify-for-amnesty.html""> the New York Times</a> (as <a href=""http://twitter.com/gabrielmalor/status/535482215791329280"" target=""_blank"">highlighted by Malor</a>), paraphrasing Schumer, said that Congress kept the law ""deliberately vague."" But when the Senate Judiciary Committee sent the Reagan bill to the full Senate, it wasn't vague at all — despite what Schumer claimed later. It <a href=""http://www.leagle.com/decision/19881748700FSupp1048_11564"">made it clear</a> that it <i>didn't </i>intend to legalize the families of IRCA beneficiaries. Here's what the Judiciary Committee report said (as quoted, in full, in a <a href=""http://www.leagle.com/decision/19881748700FSupp1048_11564"" target=""_blank"">court case from 1988</a>, in which an IRCA applicant's spouse was denied relief):</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>It is the intent of the Committee that the families of legalized aliens will obtain no special petitioning right by virtue of the legalization. They will be required to ""wait in line"" in the same manner as immediate family members of other new resident aliens.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>The executive actions that Reagan and Bush took didn't let anyone jump the line — they just allowed them to stay in the US until they could actually get in line for legal status. But it's worth noting that the people Reagan and Bush protected had specifically been left out.</p> \n<p>In July 1989, the Senate passed an Immigration Act which would have given legal status to the children and spouses of IRCA beneficiaries (while doing a bunch of other things as well). But the bill languished in the House for several months.</p> \n<p>When President Bush decided to expand the Family Fairness program to its 1.5-million immigrant size in February 1990, he was acting to protect people who would have gotten legal status in a bill that had passed the Senate but not the House.</p> \n<p>And both chambers, at the time, were controlled by the president's opposing party: the Democrats.</p> \n<p>Technically, that's the situation Obama is in right now — he's giving protections from deportation to a fraction of the people who could have gotten legalized under the bipartisan immigration bill that passed the Senate last year. That bill never got taken up in the House, which, like the House in 1990, is controlled by the opposite party to the White House.</p> \n<p>The difference is that Bush took action while there was still time left for the House to take up the bill — and the House wasn't wildly opposed to doing so. This time around, there's little hope that House Republicans will pass an immigration bill, much less one that can be reconciled with the Senate, and Republicans in both chambers are reacting to Obama's proposed action with fury.</p> \n<h3>How did Congress respond to Bush's executive action?</h3> \n<p>As it turned out, Bush's move to expand the Family Fairness program helped spur the House to take action on its stalled immigration bill. The month after Bush's announcement, a group of members of Congress <a style=""font-size: 1.15em; line-height: 1.65; background-color: #ffffff;"" href=""http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/foreign-policy/219463-when-reagan-and-ghw-bush-took-bold-executive-action-on"">introduced a bill</a> that would accomplish legislatively what Bush had done on his own: prevent the deportation of family members of IRCA-legalized immigrants. Introducing the bill, Democrat Edward Roybal <a style=""font-size: 1.15em; line-height: 1.65; background-color: #ffffff;"" href=""http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?r101:E27MR0-74:"">didn't even mention</a> Bush's recent expansion of the program  — Roybal simply mentioned that current ""INS policy"" could be reversed, and needed legislation to make it permanent.</p> \n<p>By October 1990, the House and Senate had put together a final, combined <a href=""http://ir.lawnet.fordham.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1270&amp;context=ilj"">Immigration Act</a>. The bill was pretty comprehensive in scope; among other things, it granted legal status to those family members — and actually went a little further than Bush did, granting legal status to children who were as old as 20.</p> \n<p>This is clearly what Obama hopes will happen after his executive action: a broad, comprehensive immigration bill. Exactly one Republican in Congress — Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona — has <a href=""http://talkingpointsmemo.com/dc/jeff-flake-immigration-shutown-reform"" target=""_blank"">said</a> he agrees.</p> \n<p>But most Republicans have been saying that executive action by Obama instead makes them far less inclined to pass comprehensive reform. Instead, many in the party have floated  <a style=""font-size: 1.15em; line-height: 1.65;"" href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/obama-immigration-executive-action-amnesty-congress/republican-react-obama-immigration-executive-amnesty-impeach"">suing Obama</a>, <a style=""font-size: 1.15em; line-height: 1.65; background-color: #ffffff;"" href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/11/10/7174503/ted-cruz-mitch-mcconnell-immigration-fight"">shutting down the government,</a><a style=""font-size: 1.15em; line-height: 1.65; background-color: #ffffff;"" href=""http://www.politico.com/blogs/politico-live/2014/08/king-obama-immigration-move-should-spark-impeachment-193337.html"">impeaching the president, </a>and punishing Democrats by taking massive executive actions next time they control the White House.</p> \n<p>That's the big difference between Bush's and Obama's moves: not what they did, but how Congress felt about what they did, and what the opposition party did in response.</p> \n<p> </p> \n<hr> \n<p><b>UPDATE:</b> This article has been updated to include a 1987 quote from Sen.

The GOP's political strategy against Obama keeps leading to policies conservatives hate,http://www.vox.com/2014/11/20/7254849/congressional-underreach,Immigration is just the latest example.,"<p>On Election Night, I wrote an <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/11/4/7158293/mitch-mcconnell-strategist"">homage to Mitch McConnell</a>'s political acumen. In the winter of 2008-2009, when Barack Obama was at the height of his popularity and Democrats had large majorities in both houses of Congress, he had an important insight. Republicans still had the power to withhold cooperation, deny Obama a sheen of bipartisanship on his initiatives, and ultimately to slow the gears of government. This would erode the president's popularity, and though it did not succeed in unseating him in 2012 it has made the GOP the dominant party at all other levels of American government.</p> \n<p>But as we look over President Obama's plans for <a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/obama-immigration-executive-action-amnesty-congress"">sweeping unilateral reform of deportation policy</a>, it's worth a reminder that this strategy comes at a cost. Republicans' strategy has been savvy politics, but it's forced them — repeatedly — to accept worse policy outcomes than they otherwise could have obtained. Alleged presidential overreach is largely a mirror-image of systematic congressional underreach, a dynamic in which GOP members believe constructive engagement would be politically counterproductive and thus deliberately choose to leave obtainable policy concessions on the cutting room floor.</p> \n<h3>Health care and climate change</h3> \n<p>The clearest example of obstructionism leading to policy costs is probably the <a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/obamacare/what-is-obamacare"">Affordable Care Act</a>. Democrats had the votes to get this done, but the party was plainly desperate for bipartisan cover. In exchange for votes, Republican members of congress could have gotten <a href=""http://www.cbsnews.com/news/obama-clarifies-position-on-tort-reform-on-60-minutes/"">tort reform</a> or other policy priorities. But they preferred to keep their fingerprints off the bill, even if that meant a policy outcome they liked less.</p> \n<p>On climate change, Republican behavior was even more counterproductive.</p> \n<p>Back during George W. Bush's administration, the Supreme Court had ordered the Environmental Protection Agency to begin regulating greenhouse gas emissions. The Bush administration got around this by <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/25/washington/25epa.html"">refusing to open the email</a> in which the EPA stated that carbon dioxide is a pollutant (really). As soon as Obama became president, it was obvious that this particular strategy was dead. Either Congress would pass a new legislative framework for dealing with carbon-dioxide emissions, or else the email would be opened and the existing regulatory framework would proceed. Climate legislation would have reduced carbon-dioxide emissions by pricing them, which would have created a pool of revenue. Some of that revenue could be used to reduce taxes or advance other GOP priorities.</p> \n<p>But Republicans preferred to keep their fingerprints off any kind of action, even if that meant a policy outcome they liked less.</p> \n<h3>Entitlements and the budget</h3> \n<p>A similar preference for worse policy outcomes has manifested itself through inaction as well. At various junctures around the ""fiscal cliff"" and the first debt ceiling standoff, the Obama administration offered different iterations of <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/12/09/wonkbook-the-grand-bargain-is-over/"">""grand bargain""</a> that would have cut Social Security and Medicare while raising tax revenue above its Bush-era levels. Obama offered this deal even though the Bush tax cuts were written to <i>automatically</i> expire in the case of inaction. Obama, in other words, was offering a real policy concession (entitlement cuts) in exchange for political cover for tax hikes that were going to happen anyway.</p> \n<p>But Republicans preferred to keep their fingerprints off any kind of action, even if that meant a policy outcome they liked less.</p> \n<p>These triple-breakdowns of bipartisanship have made Obama a much less popular and successful-looking president than he otherwise could have been. He would have liked to have been the steward of a landmark bipartisan health care overall, a comprehensive budget deal, and an ambitious first cut at the titanic global challenge of climate change. Instead he's the champion of an incredibly contentious health care overall, presides over a still-unsolved long-term budget proposal, and his climate legacy is tenuous and subject to total reversal if Republicans win in 2016.</p> \n<p>But this Republican strategy has left the long-term trajectory of federal taxes and federal spending in the United States considerably <i>higher</i> than it would have been had Republicans wanted to make deals. For a party driven by a core commitment to low taxes and welfare state rollback, it's a bit odd.</p> \n<h3>Same song, different tune on immigration</h3> \n<p>Which brings us, of course, to immigration. Much of the punditry around Obama's allegedly norm-violating actions seems to simply take congressional inaction on this issue as a given.</p> \n<p>But Congress is, itself, violating a basic norm of American politics — the norm that says given a choice between a better policy outcome and a worse one, a legislator should choose the better outcome. We are accustomed to the violation of this norm because Republicans, at the urging of their leaders, have been following it rigidly since 2009. But something interesting happened in 2013, and many Senate Republicans went back to the old norm. They partnered with <a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/immigration-immigrants-reform-us/what-is-the-senate-immigration-reform-bill"">Senate Democrats to pass a bill</a> that achieved Democrats' key goal of creating a ""path to citizenship"" for unauthorized immigrants living in the United States. It also, as bipartisan bills tend to, advanced a number of Republican priorities. That included a huge surge in border security funding, tighter e-verify rules, and a number of growth-friendly modifications to the future flow of legal immigration.</p> \n<p>House Republicans mostly did not like the bill. But they also wouldn't give the bill an up-or-down vote in the House. And they <i>also</i> wouldn't write a version of immigration reform that they <i>did</i> like and pass that. They preferred to do nothing, even though inaction would lead to a policy outcome they like less.</p> \n<p>It's not a new strategy. And it's not a crazy strategy either. But it is a deliberate choice. If Republicans wanted more conservative-friendly policy outcomes, they could be getting them. But they prefer more Republican-friendly political outcomes. It's not unreasonable for conservatives to think that this tradeoff is the right one, all things considered. But what is unreasonable is for conservatives to refuse to recognize that it's a real choice, a choice that is in their hands, and a choice that they continually make in the direction of worse policy rather than better policy.</p>",Politics

Obama's speech on his executive actions on immigration,http://www.vox.com/2014/11/20/7257469/obama-immigration-order-speech,What the president said about the biggest immigration moves in years.,"<p>President Obama addressed the nation tonight about his new executive actions on immigration. For an explainer about what the new actions mean, <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/11/20/7250255/immigration-reform-obama-executive-action"">click here</a>.</p> \n<p>Here's the text of the speech:</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>As Prepared for Delivery --<br> <br>My fellow Americans, tonight, I'd like to talk with you about immigration.<br> <br>For more than 200 years, our tradition of welcoming immigrants from around the world has given us a tremendous advantage over other nations.  It's kept us youthful, dynamic, and entrepreneurial.  It has shaped our character as a people with limitless possibilities - people not trapped by our past, but able to remake ourselves as we choose.<br> <br>But today, our immigration system is broken, and everybody knows it. <br> <br>Families who enter our country the right way and play by the rules watch others flout the rules.  Business owners who offer their workers good wages and benefits see the competition exploit undocumented immigrants by paying them far less.  All of us take offense to anyone who reaps the rewards of living in America without taking on the responsibilities of living in America.  And undocumented immigrants who desperately want to embrace those responsibilities see little option but to remain in the shadows, or risk their families being torn apart. <br> <br>It's been this way for decades.  And for decades, we haven't done much about it.<br> <br>When I took office, I committed to fixing this broken immigration system.  And I began by doing what I could to secure our borders.  Today, we have more agents and technology deployed to secure our southern border than at any time in our history.  And over the past six years, illegal border crossings have been cut by more than half.  Although this summer, there was a brief spike in unaccompanied children being apprehended at our border, the number of such children is now actually lower than it's been in nearly two years.  Overall, the number of people trying to cross our border illegally is at its lowest level since the 1970s.  Those are the facts.<br> <br>Meanwhile, I worked with Congress on a comprehensive fix, and last year, 68 Democrats, Republicans, and Independents came together to pass a bipartisan bill in the Senate.  It wasn't perfect.  It was a compromise, but it reflected common sense.  It would have doubled the number of border patrol agents, while giving undocumented immigrants a pathway to citizenship if they paid a fine, started paying their taxes, and went to the back of the line.  And independent experts said that it would help grow our economy and shrink our deficits. <br> <br>Had the House of Representatives allowed that kind of a bill a simple yes-or-no vote, it would have passed with support from both parties, and today it would be the law.  But for a year and a half now, Republican leaders in the House have refused to allow that simple vote.<br> <br>Now, I continue to believe that the best way to solve this problem is by working together to pass that kind of common sense law.  But until that happens, there are actions I have the legal authority to take as President - the same kinds of actions taken by Democratic and Republican Presidents before me - that will help make our immigration system more fair and more just.<br> <br>Tonight, I am announcing those actions.<br> <br>First, we'll build on our progress at the border with additional resources for our law enforcement personnel so that they can stem the flow of illegal crossings, and speed the return of those who do cross over.<br> <br>Second, I will make it easier and faster for high-skilled immigrants, graduates, and entrepreneurs to stay and contribute to our economy, as so many business leaders have proposed. <br> <br>Third, we'll take steps to deal responsibly with the millions of undocumented immigrants who already live in our country.<br> <br>I want to say more about this third issue, because it generates the most passion and controversy.  Even as we are a nation of immigrants, we are also a nation of laws.  Undocumented workers broke our immigration laws, and I believe that they must be held accountable - especially those who may be dangerous.  That's why, over the past six years, deportations of criminals are up 80 percent.  And that's why we're going to keep focusing enforcement resources on actual threats to our security.  Felons, not families.  Criminals, not children.  Gang members, not a mother who's working hard to provide for her kids.  We'll prioritize, just like law enforcement does every day. <br> <br>But even as we focus on deporting criminals, the fact is, millions of immigrants - in every state, of every race and nationality - will still live here illegally.  And let's be honest - tracking down, rounding up, and deporting millions of people isn't realistic.  Anyone who suggests otherwise isn't being straight with you.  It's also not who we are as Americans.  After all, most of these immigrants have been here a long time.  They work hard, often in tough, low-paying jobs.  They support their families.  They worship at our churches.  Many of their kids are American-born or spent most of their lives here, and their hopes, dreams, and patriotism are just like ours. <br> <br>As my predecessor, President Bush, once put it:  ""They are a part of American life.""<br> <br>Now here's the thing: we expect people who live in this country to play by the rules.  We expect that those who cut the line will not be unfairly rewarded.  So we're going to offer the following deal:  If you've been in America for more than five years; if you have children who are American citizens or legal residents; if you register, pass a criminal background check, and you're willing to pay your fair share of taxes - you'll be able to apply to stay in this country temporarily, without fear of deportation.  You can come out of the shadows and get right with the law.<br> <br>That's what this deal is.  Now let's be clear about what it isn't.  This deal does not apply to anyone who has come to this country recently.  It does not apply to anyone who might come to America illegally in the future.  It does not grant citizenship, or the right to stay here permanently, or offer the same benefits that citizens receive - only Congress can do that.  All we're saying is we're not going to deport you. <br> <br>I know some of the critics of this action call it amnesty.  Well, it's not.  Amnesty is the immigration system we have today - millions of people who live here without paying their taxes or playing by the rules, while politicians use the issue to scare people and whip up votes at election time. <br> <br>That's the real amnesty - leaving this broken system the way it is.  Mass amnesty would be unfair.  Mass deportation would be both impossible and contrary to our character.  What I'm describing is accountability - a commonsense, middle ground approach:  If you meet the criteria, you can come out of the shadows and get right with the law.  If you're a criminal, you'll be deported.  If you plan to enter the U.S. illegally, your chances of getting caught and sent back just went up.<br> <br>The actions I'm taking are not only lawful, they're the kinds of actions taken by every single Republican President and every single Democratic President for the past half century.  And to those Members of Congress who question my authority to make our immigration system work better, or question the wisdom of me acting where Congress has failed, I have one answer:  Pass a bill.  I want to work with both parties to pass a more permanent legislative solution.  And the day I sign that bill into law, the actions I take will no longer be necessary.  Meanwhile, don't let a disagreement over a single issue be a dealbreaker on every issue.  That's not how our democracy works, and Congress certainly shouldn't shut down our government again just because we disagree on this.  Americans are tired of gridlock.  What our country needs from us right now is a common purpose - a higher purpose.<br> <br>Most Americans support the types of reforms I've talked about tonight.  But I understand the disagreements held by many of you at home.  Millions of us, myself included, go back generations in this country, with ancestors who put in the painstaking work to become citizens.  So we don't like the notion that anyone might get a free pass to American citizenship.  I know that some worry immigration will change the very fabric of who we are, or take our jobs, or stick it to middle-class families at a time when they already feel like they've gotten the raw end of the deal for over a decade.  I hear these concerns.  But that's not what these steps would do.  Our history and the facts show that immigrants are a net plus for our economy and our society.  And I believe it's important that all of us have this debate without impugning each other's character.<br> <br>Because for all the back-and-forth of Washington, we have to remember that this debate is about something bigger.  It's about who we are as a country, and who we want to be for future generations.<br> <br>Are we a nation that tolerates the hypocrisy of a system where workers who pick our fruit and make our beds never have a chance to get right with the law?  Or are we a nation that gives them a chance to make amends, take responsibility, and give their kids a better future?<br> <br>Are we a nation that accepts the cruelty of ripping children from their parents' arms?  Or are we a nation that values families, and works to keep them together?<br> <br>Are we a nation that educates the world's best and brightest in our universities, only to send them home to create businesses in countries that compete against us?  Or are we a nation that encourages them to stay and create jobs, businesses, and industries right here in America?<br> <br>That's what this debate is all about.  We need more than politics as usual when it comes to immigration; we need reasoned, thoughtful, compassionate debate that focuses on our hopes, not our fears.<br> <br>I know the politics of this issue are tough.  But let me tell you why I have come to feel so strongly about it.  Over the past few years, I have seen the determination of immigrant fathers who worked two or three jobs, without taking a dime from the government, and at risk at any moment of losing it all, just to build a better life for their kids.  I've seen the heartbreak and anxiety of children whose mothers might be taken away from them just because they didn't have the right papers.  I've seen the courage of students who, except for the circumstances of their birth, are as American as Malia or Sasha; students who bravely come out as undocumented in hopes they could make a difference in a country they love.  These people - our neighbors, our classmates, our friends - they did not come here in search of a free ride or an easy life.  They came to work, and study, and serve in our military, and above all, contribute to America's success.<br> <br>Tomorrow, I'll travel to Las Vegas and meet with some of these students, including a young woman named Astrid Silva.  Astrid was brought to America when she was four years old.  Her only possessions were a cross, her doll, and the frilly dress she had on.  When she started school, she didn't speak any English.  She caught up to the other kids by reading newspapers and watching PBS, and became a good student.  Her father worked in landscaping.  Her mother cleaned other people's homes.  They wouldn't let Astrid apply to a technology magnet school for fear the paperwork would out her as an undocumented immigrant - so she applied behind their back and got in.  Still, she mostly lived in the shadows - until her grandmother, who visited every year from Mexico, passed away, and she couldn't travel to the funeral without risk of being found out and deported.  It was around that time she decided to begin advocating for herself and others like her, and today, Astrid Silva is a college student working on her third degree.<br> <br>Are we a nation that kicks out a striving, hopeful immigrant like Astrid - or are we a nation that finds a way to welcome her in?<br> <br>Scripture tells us that we shall not oppress a stranger, for we know the heart of a stranger - we were strangers once, too.<br> <br>My fellow Americans, we are and always will be a nation of immigrants.  We were strangers once, too.  And whether our forebears were strangers who crossed the Atlantic, or the Pacific, or the Rio Grande, we are here only because this country welcomed them in, and taught them that to be an American is about something more than what we look like, or what our last names are, or how we worship.  What makes us Americans is our shared commitment to an ideal - that all of us are created equal, and all of us have the chance to make of our lives what we will.<br> <br>That's the country our parents and grandparents and generations before them built for us.

"Obama is finally making the case for immigration, not just ""immigration reform""",http://www.vox.com/2014/11/21/7257643/case-for-immigration,"With legislative compromise dead, a riskier but more honest debate begins.","<p><span>By the standards of the recent debate, </span><span>Obama's </span><a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/11/20/7257469/obama-immigration-order-speech"">speech laying out his approach</a><span> was a radical shift: it was largely about </span><span>immigration, </span><span>rather than meta-immigration. It was about policy rather than process. And it was about immigrants rather than border security.</span></p> \n<p>Obama is shifting policy in a direction that is more favorable to immigrants for a simple reason that few politicians dare utter: because he believes immigration is good for America. He began with the thought that immigration ""has given us a tremendous advantage over other nations"" and ended with the notion that a welcoming attitude toward immigrants is ""a tradition we must uphold.""</p> \n<p>This might seem like an obvious rhetorical strategy for a pro-immigration president. But it's actually newer than you might think.</p> \n<h3>Border security and the path to citizenship</h3> \n<p>Dating back to the Bush-era immigration reform push, the political project of immigration reform has been a somewhat awkward combination of lenience and stringency. Comprehensive reform was meant to both help unauthorized migrants already living in the United States <i>and</i> crack down on future unauthorized border crossings. And, indeed, the comprehensive reform bill the Senate passed in 2013 featured <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/senators-approve-border-security-deal-ahead-of-passing-immigration-bill/2013/06/26/afb4e056-de92-11e2-b2d4-ea6d8f477a01_story.html"" target=""_blank"">genuinely massive investments</a> in border security.</p> \n<p>The result was a piece of legislation that, according to the administration-friendly <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.americanprogress.org/press/release/2013/05/02/61935/release-cap-releases-current-and-estimated-future-immigration-numbers-based-on-s-744/"">analysts at the Center for American Progress</a>, would actually have <i>reduced</i> the total flow of immigrants into the United States of America.</p> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""2477268"" alt=""FutureFlowNumbers-1.0.png"" src=""http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2477268/FutureFlowNumbers-1.0.png""></p> \n<p>There was always a certain kind of narrow political logic to this double-emphasis. The two loudest voices on immigration issues were unauthorized migrants, and xenophobic nativists. So a traditional legislative logroll attempted to meet both worries simultaneously. Forgiveness paired with a promise to be harsher in the future. This was the formula behind the successful 1986 amnesty law, and behind the failed legislative efforts of 2007 and 2013. Obama's executive action is different.</p> \n<p>The steps he is taking to help immigrants don't go as far as congressional action would have gone, but border hawks are really getting nothing at all. This is structurally typical of how <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/11/20/7254849/congressional-underreach"" target=""_blank"">GOP political tactics interfere with conservative policy outcomes</a>, but very atypical for the American immigration debate. Obama is doing something to help immigrants not as part of a 11-dimensional effort to secure the border, but because openness to immigration is a source of American national strength.</p> \n<h3>A new pro-immigration politics</h3> \n<p>On the merits, the case that policy should be favorable to immigrants because immigration is good for America is strong. Economic research shows that <a href=""http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2013/04/22/immigration_raises_american_income.html"" target=""_blank"">immigration raises incomes</a> for native-born Americans. Immigrants create new businesses at much higher rates than native-born Americans — a particular boon amidst a <a href=""http://www.brookings.edu/research/papers/2014/11/driving-decline-firm-formation-rate-hathaway-litan"" target=""_blank"">slowdown</a> in the rate of new companies being formed in America. Immigration reduces the <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/10/28/7078167/secular-stagnation"" target=""_blank"">risk of secular stagnation</a>. It <a href=""http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/07/02/immigration-and-social-security/"" target=""_blank"">increases the sustainability of Social Security</a>.</p> \n<p>Many people profess to find these arguments contrarian or counterintuitive. But when we remove nationalist blinders, I think they become obvious.</p> \n<p>States like Texas that are enjoying high levels of in-migration from the rest of the USA don't try to keep domestic migrants out. Nor do they regard migrants as crippling their local economies. Nor does the national policy consensus hold that people having babies is some kind of macroeconomic disaster. A growing population is rightly understood to be both a cause and consequence of prosperity. A modern economy is made of people, and the ability to attract and retain new people is a source of economic strength.</p> \n<p>This is why in some ways the most exciting parts of Obama's immigration proposals are the ones that have thus far been least-debated — the ones pertaining to <i>legal</i> migration. The details of these initiatives are not yet fully clear. But it seems Obama will make it easier for foreign-born recent graduates of US universities to get <a href=""http://www.uscis.gov/eir/visa-guide/f-1-opt-optional-practical-training/f-1-optional-practical-training-opt"" target=""_blank"">permission to stay and work here</a>. He's also looking to ""streamline"" the process by which companies can get <a href=""http://www.uscis.gov/eir/visa-guide/l-1-intracompany-transferee/l-1-visa"" target=""_blank"">L-1 visas</a> to bring foreign managers here. He wants to make it easier for recipients of H-1B technology guest worker visas to also work in the United States, and he has an as-yet-unexplained plan to ""expand immigration options for foreign entrepreneurs.""</p> \n<p>In other words, he wants to be nicer to otherwise law-abiding unauthorized migrants with roots in the United States <i>and</i> he wants to open the door to more immigrants.</p> \n<h3>Can it work?</h3> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""2477334"" alt=""wy1gcnhlkeepmhdtxsg7aa.0.png"" src=""http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2477334/wy1gcnhlkeepmhdtxsg7aa.0.png""></p> \n<p>It should be said that there's no great mystery as to why pro-immigrant politicians have generally not taken the straightforwardly pro-immigration approach. The view that the United States would benefit from more immigration, though correct, is <a href=""http://www.gallup.com/poll/171962/decrease-immigration-increase.aspx"" target=""_blank"">consistently unpopular</a>. <span>On the other hand, when you ask Americans how many immigrants they think are already in the country they wildly overestimate, telling pollsters </span><a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2014/oct/29/todays-key-fact-you-are-probably-wrong-about-almost-everything"" target=""_blank"">32 out of 100 people in the country are immigrants</a>. The correct number is 13. As if often the case, the public turns out not to have a detailed understanding of a policy issue.</p> \n<p>And the steady upward trend in the size of the minority calling for more immigrants is interesting, especially because no nationally prominent leaders have given voice to that view.</p> \n<p>Thursday night, speaking from essentially a position of political desperation, President Obama became the first major politician to do that. With legislative options dead, and inaction politically untenable, he made the case that hadn't been front and center in the past decade of ""immigration reform"" debates. That having people move here for school and work and to raise families makes us stronger and richer as a country. That we should welcome immigrants not as part of an elaborate border-security scheme, but as a good in and of themselves.</p>",Politics
Obamaâ€™s advantage is that he has an immigration policy. Republicans donâ€™t.,http://www.vox.com/2014/11/20/7258009/republican-immigration-plan,Republicans need to change that.,"<p>There's one way President Obama's <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/11/20/7250255/immigration-reform-obama-executive-action"" target=""_blank"">executive action on immigration</a> has been a boon to Republicans. Instead of coming up with their own immigration policy, the've been able to just unite against Obama's. But fury isn't a policy. And, as is clear, fury isn't going to stop Obama's policy.</p> \n<p>But there is a simple way out of this immigration mess for Republicans: pass a bill that President Obama can sign.</p> \n<p>Not a bill, mind you, that Obama necessarily <em>wants</em> to sign. It doesn't even have to be a bill Obama does sign. It can be a bill Obama will loathe. Republicans can propose the most militarized border this side of the DMZ. They can erase the Senate bill's path to citizenship. They can electrify the fence. They can wall unauthorized immigrants off from social services. Hell, they can even pass a bill authorizing funds to deport all 11 million unauthorized immigrants living in the US.</p> \n<p>But one way or another, Republicans need to decide what to do with the 11 million unauthorized immigrants living in the country now. They need to take away Obama's single strongest argument — that this is a crisis, and that congressional Republicans don't have an answer and won't let anyone else come up with one.</p> \n<p>Republicans aren't just the opposition party anymore. They are, arguably, the governing party — they will soon control the House, the Senate, the Supreme Court, most state legislatures, and more governorships. And the governing party needs to solve — or at least propose solutions — to the nation's problems. And that means the Republican policy on immigration needs to be something more than opposing Obama's immigration policies. It needs to be something more than vague noises about border security.</p> \n<p>This isn't a problem made up by Obama. It's math. There are 11 million unauthorized immigrants living in the country right now. Congress allocates enough money to deport roughly 400,000 of them annually. Our policy towards the 10.6 million unauthorized immigrants we're not deporting is that we don't have a policy. Democrats support a path to citizenship. Republicans don't support anything.</p> \n<p>""To those Members of Congress who question my authority to make our immigration system work better, or question the wisdom of me acting where Congress has failed, I have one answer: Pass a bill,"" Obama <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/11/20/7257469/obama-immigration-order-speech"">said</a> on Thursday.</p> \n<p>Republicans have a word for Obama's strategy here: blackmail. The irony is rich. Democrats have been feeling blackmailed by Republicans for years now. To resolve the debt-ceiling crisis of 2011 — a crisis they saw as pure blackmail — Democrats accepted budgets cuts they loathed. Perhaps that's the price of wielding power in American politics in 2014. You have to bargain under conditions you consider indecent.</p> \n<p>The good news for Republicans is that they don't have to suffer the total defeat Democrats endured in 2011. They could support a bill many in their party really like. They could pass the Senate immigration bill without a path to citizenship. Maybe Obama wouldn't sign it. But if he didn't, it would be much harder for him to argue that he has no choice save for sweeping executive action. Republicans would have turned his argument against him.</p> \n<p>And what are their alternatives? Impotent rage? A government shutdown? A slow-moving lawsuit? A disastrous impeachment effort? A solemn vow that whatever damage Obama does to the constitutional order, Republicans will double it when they retake the White House? All of these are likelier to wound the GOP than Obama. None of these are likely to benefit the party in 2016. And none of them solve the underlying problem.</p> \n<p>Nor does continued confusion around immigration help Republicans. Just ask Mitt Romney, who tried to split the difference between restrictionists and reformers by endorsing ""self-deportation"". That worked well enough that Reince Priebus, chair of the Republican National Committee, <a href=""http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/reince-priebus-says-self-deportation-is-not-our-party-s-position-but-it-is"">came out</a> after the election to make clear that ""it's not our party's position."" But that's only because his party doesn't have a position.</p> \n<p>That, really, is Obama's advantage right now. Even if you think he's going too far, he at least wants to solve the problem. Republicans don't seem to want to do anything except stop Obama from solving the problem. That's not a winning position. More to the point, it's not a responsible one.</p>",Politics
What could a Republican president do with Obama's executive power theories?,http://www.vox.com/2014/11/21/7259079/republican-obama-immigration-precedents,Stop collecting taxes? Stop enforcing environmental laws?,"<p>It's not just deportation policy. As I described <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/9/9/5964421/obama-lawsuit-republicans-abuse-of-power"">in a recent feature</a>, Obama has effectively modified or refused to enforce key provisions of laws ranging from the Affordable Care Act to No Child Left Behind. He really has expanded the scope of executive power in some novel ways.</p> \n<p>So at a moment when many liberals are cheering Obama for taking action on deportation policy, it's worth considering how future Republican presidents could use these precedents to their own ends. Several commentators have been floating various possibilities about how the GOP could take advantage of those powers in ways Democrats would surely hate. ""What if a Republican president announced that he would stop enforcing the payment of estate taxes? Or suspend enforcement of regulations on industrial pollution?"" <a href=""http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2014/08/obamas-immigration-plan-should-scare-liberals.html"" target=""_blank"">wrote</a> Jonathan Chait.</p> \n<p>But as you dig deeper into these scenarios, it comes clear that some of them just wouldn't work — and some of them Republicans supported long before Obama's latest executive actions.</p> \n<h3>1) Taxes</h3> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""2478002"" alt=""Rick Perry"" src=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2478002/458445470.0.jpg""></p> \n<div style=""text-align:center""> \n<p class=""caption"">Will President Rick Perry implement a flat tax through executive authority? (Erich Schlegel / Getty)</p> \n</div> \n<p>In a recent blog post, South Texas College of Law Professor Josh Blackman <a href=""http://joshblackman.com/blog/2014/11/20/exclusive-preview-of-presidents-address-on-executive-power/"">laid out a scenario</a> for how a future President Rick Perry could ram through tax cuts. ""Going forward, all Americans will be subject to a 17% flat tax,"" his fictional President Perry says by executive fiat. ""Perry"" continues by announcing he's ""instructed the Department of Justice to defer all prosecutions"" for anyone who doesn't pay their full tax bill according to the ""old brackets."" He makes sure to add that ""Congress has not given me enough resources to prosecute all tax offenders"" — so he simply has to prioritize.</p> \n<p>Like deportation and most other policy initiatives on this list, the refusal of a president to collect taxes doesn't harm anyone. That means it would be very hard to establish a ""standing"" claim that would get federal courts to take a case on the topic — so it's possible that a president willing to push this could get away with it without the courts stepping in.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""right""> it does appear to be true that President Perry could <em style=""line-height: 28.4624996185303px;"">pardon</em> every tax offender</q></p> \n<p>Yet Walter Dellinger, who served as solicitor general during the Clinton administration, argues that the example isn't really analogous. ""A president can cut back on enforcement of tax laws,"" he <a href=""http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/jurisprudence/2014/11/anyone_who_thinks_the_legal_arguments_behind_obama_s_immigration_order_are.single.html"">writes at Slate</a>, but ""no president can relieve any one American of a statutory obligation to pay taxes. The next president can come collecting—and interest and penalties will be accruing until he or she does.""</p> \n<p>Now, it does appear to be true that this ""President Perry"" could <em>pardon</em> every tax offender. An 1866 Supreme Court ruling held, <a href=""http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/explainer/2008/07/preemptive_presidential_pardons.html"">according to</a> Jacob Leibenluft at Slate, that ""once an act has been committed, the president can issue a pardon at any time—regardless of whether charges have even been filed."" The pardon power, though, is unrelated to Obama's actions here. It was absurdly powerful (but little-used) before he took office, and will remain so after.</p> \n<p>So rather than a mass pardon of tax offenders, which would surely evoke public outrage even though it's perfectly constitutional, the more likely route for a future Republican president is a lower-profile reduction of resources devoted to certain enforcement actions — which already happened during the Bush years. As Ezra Klein <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/11/20/7253779/obama-immigration-plan-facts"">wrote</a>, ""President George W. Bush cut the number of IRS agents auditing estate tax abuses. One estate tax lawyer <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/23/business/23tax.html"">described</a> the action to the New York Times as a 'back-door way for the Bush administration to achieve what it cannot get from Congress, which is repeal of the estate tax.'""</p> \n<h3>2) Environmental laws</h3> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""2478072"" alt=""President George W.

In an interview with me, Blackman also suggested that a Republican president could use unilateral action to limit enforcement of, say, fracking laws in Texas.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""right"">After an unfavorable court ruling, White House officials refused to open an email from the EPA</q></p> \n<p>But action of this sort would face the same problem as tax law non-enforcement. ""A general nonenforcement policy in those contexts would leave the violators culpable, and subject to subsequent punishment"" for their offenses, <a href=""http://balkin.blogspot.com/2014/11/dispelling-myths-of-new-dhs-immigration.html"">writes</a> Marty Lederman, a professor at Georgetown Law and a former Obama Justice Department official. ""Their potential fines would accrue every day, and they would remain in danger of being convicted as criminal malefactors.""</p> \n<p>Additionally, the chances the courts will get involved are somewhat higher with environmental violations, due to the way standing works.  ""Individuals have private causes of action"" that could provide standing for lawsuits, Blackman told me. Plus, states have standing under the <em>Massachusetts v. EPA</em> holding — a 2007 case where a 5-4 Supreme Court ordered Bush's EPA to regulate carbon dioxide as a pollutant after several states sued over his administration's inaction.</p> \n<p>But as the Bush experience shows, the courts can have difficulty forcing the administration's hand here. When the <em>Massachusetts v. EPA</em> ruling came down, the Bush administration refused to carry it out anyway — White House officials <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/25/washington/25epa.html?_r=2&amp;"">wouldn't even open an email </a>from the EPA that responded to it.</p> \n<p>In a recent paper, Zachary Price, a visiting professor at UC Hastings Law, <a href=""http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2359685"">describes</a> another instance where the Bush administration wouldn't budge after the courts struck down an environmental policy as too lax. Price describes how Bush ""promulgated permissive regulations that would have exempted"" many modifications to power plants from the Clean Air Act's ""New Source Review"" requirements — leading to an unfavorable court ruling:</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>PRICE: ""The Administration then exercised prosecutorial discretion to decline enforcement with respect to plant changes that the invalidated rule would have permitted. Indeed, for a year and a half after the court’s ruling, the Environmental Protection Agency evidently maintained an explicit internal policy that the law should be enforced only in accordance with the invalidated rule (even with respect to past violations that the regulation would not have covered).""</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Of course, it's always possible that a future administration could push the envelope even further. But it looks like even though the courts are more likely to try to force the administration's hand when it comes to environmental laws, a motivated Republican administration was already able to resist those pressures.</p> \n<h3>3) Obamacare</h3> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""1402176"" alt=""Mitt Romney"" src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/1402176/130425784.0.jpg""></p> \n<div style=""text-align:center""> \n<p class=""caption"">Mitt Romney.

But while it's absolutely true that an unfriendly administration can use executive discretion or non-enforcement to seriously impact the health law — that was always the case.</p> \n<p>Indeed, Mitt Romney's campaign platform in 2012 said that on the first day of his administration he'd use executive orders to <a href=""http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1011/65798.html"" target=""_blank"">waive Obamacare's requirements</a> in all 50 states — even though the law didn't actually give him that power. (The waiver power in the law was to kick in in 2017, and could only be used if the states set up a new plan that ""covers at least the same number as would be covered in the ACA, includes at least the same benefits and cost sharing protections, and doesn't increase the federal deficit,"" former Democratic aide John McDonough<a href=""http://www.boston.com/lifestyle/health/health_stew/2014/01/mr_wydens_moment.html""> wrote</a>.)</p> \n<p>We'll never know whether Romney would actually have gone through with this. But if he did opt to, that would've taken non-enforcement far, far further than any of the <a href=""http://joshblackman.com/blog/2014/08/04/spreadsheet-with-32-and-counting-administrative-changes-to-aca/?utm_source=twitterfeed&amp;utm_medium=twitter&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+JoshBlackmansBlog+%28Josh+Blackman%27s+Blog%29"">delays and modifications</a> Obama's administration has made to certain provisions of the health law.</p> \n<p>And, importantly, if President Romney did this it wouldn't have been <em>because</em> of Obama's executive actions on other topics. He made the promise because many Republican constituencies, and much of the GOP base, were highly motivated to weaken Obamacare. The fact of the matter is that Republicans and their supporters detest the law, and would have already used whatever legal tools they could find to undermine it.</p> \n<h3>Politics rules</h3> \n<p>This all goes to show that despite the fears of legal slippery slopes, for most administrations, the key factors they'll consider when they decide how much to ""non-enforce"" will be political. During the Bush administration, important constituencies wanted limited or unenthusiastic enforcement of tax, environmental, and labor laws — so the administration decided these were worth taking some lumps in the press and in public opinion. A similar calculation was at play here for Obama.</p> \n<p>There will certainly be more creative ways future administrations will try to limit enforcement of the law, when it suits them, in ways that are impossible to foresee now. After all, before the Obama administration, who could have possibly predicted that he'd <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/7/30/5953325/house-of-representatives-sues-obama"">be sued</a> because he chose to delay a provision in his own massive new health law by a year?</p> \n<p>But when it comes to the oft-discussed ""norms"" of politics, it will be extremely hard for future Republican presidents to <em>rhetorically</em> cite Obama's immigration actions as a precedent, when so many in the party <a href=""http://www.vox.com/xpress/2014/11/20/7257589/obama-immigration-speech-reactions"">have denounced</a> it as a massive and tyrannical overreach. The president needs to present his actions to the country as constitutional and responsible plans to better the country, not as unconstitutional and irresponsible efforts at payback. A lot of partisan acrobatics tend to take place over executive power issues, but this would be an especially bizarre-looking contortion.</p> \n<p>Instead, both parties are likely to continue to push ahead with the trend of growing executive authority — carving out new ways for presidents to get what they want when Congress won't cooperate. That trend predated Obama, and it will succeed him, too.</p>",Politics
Hereâ€™s why you shouldnâ€™t call Obamaâ€™s executive action â€œlegalizationâ€,http://www.vox.com/2014/11/22/7263043/obama-legalize-immigrants,It's not just inaccurate. It's actually harmful.,"<p>Many people have described the centerpiece of President Obama's <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/11/20/7250255/immigration-reform-obama-executive-action"">executive actions on immigration</a> as a ""legalization"" program, or said that it gives 4.3 million unauthorized immigrants in the US ""legal status."" This is wrong.</p> \n<p>The deferred-action program for parents of US citizens and permanent residents, and the expansion of the <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/11/19/7229439/daca-immigration-executive-action"">existing DACA program</a> for unauthorized immigrants who arrived as children, offer protection from deportation. But they do not change those immigrants' legal status (or rather, lack of legal status).</p> \n<p>""Lawful status"" is actually defined in immigration law — and it's defined to exclude DACA recipients, or future deferred-action beneficiaries as well. That matters, because there are other laws that govern, for example, whether someone without ""lawful status"" can get, say, in-state college tuition in a particular state. (DACA recipients <i>do </i>have ""lawful presence,"" which isn't the same thing, and which is generally the standard for drivers' licenses.)</p> \n<p>Furthermore, because deferred action doesn't give legal status, it can be reversed by the president at any time — which is why there's concern about what will happen to Obama's deferred action if a Republican wins in 2016.</p> \n<p>This isn't just hair-splitting. There are two big, real problems with calling it a legalization program:</p> \n<h3>1) Calling it legalization enables notario fraud</h3> \n<p>Scammy <i>notarios </i>(people who claim to be immigration law professionals, but aren't actually lawyers) are a <a href=""http://www.americanbar.org/groups/public_services/immigration/projects_initiatives/fightnotariofraud/about_notario_fraud.html"">tremendous problem</a> in America. One <a href=""http://chicago.cbslocal.com/2013/03/08/city-44-percent-of-immigration-service-providers-committing-fraud/"">investigation in Chicago</a> in 2013 found that 44 percent of a sample of immigration service providers were fraudulent.</p> \n<p><i>Notarios</i> flourish because there are a lot of immigrants out there (both authorized and not) desperate for legal help, and a lot of confusion about how immigration law actually works. And they're happy to take advantage of any rumor of a legalization program to get uninformed immigrants in the door.</p> \n<p>This was a major problem when organizers were trying to <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/8/18/5999601/deferred-action-obama-immigration-daca"" target=""_blank"">get young unauthorized immigrants to sign up for the DACA program</a> in 2012. When I asked Mario Hernandez, an organizer in Houston, what his biggest challenge was to educating the public about DACA, he told me it was <i>notarios</i> telling people to apply for the DREAM Act — permanent legal status — or, worse, helping them with their DACA paperwork but <i>telling </i>them it was for the DREAM Act. That puts the immigrants at risk of accidentally misrepresenting their status on a legal document — which is a federal crime and could get them deported.</p> \n<p>""Deferred action"" isn't as appealing a hook for <i>notarios</i> — and furthermore, an immigrant who knows what she applied for isn't at risk of accidentally committing fraud on a legal document later. But the more people talk about a new ""legalization"" program, the easier it is for <i>notarios</i> to tell immigrants they can get legal for only a few hundred (or thousand) dollars.</p> \n<h3>2) If it were legalization, it actually <i>would </i>be an executive power grab</h3> \n<p>Immigration law gives the executive branch a lot of authority to discretion over who to deport and who not to deport, given that the resources simply don't exist to deport everyone. But the executive can't create new forms of legal status — or get rid of existing ones. Only Congress can do that.</p> \n<p>A future administration can undo the deferred action program, but couldn't reverse a true legalization program. That's because the first is something the executive branch can do: it can create it, or take it away. But the executive can't do that for legalization.</p> \n<p>So if Obama had actually given immigrants legal status — something that couldn't be undone — it totally would have been the illegal, unconstitutional executive power grab that many Republicans are saying it is.</p>",Politics

In addition, he served a combined total of around 15 years on the city council — he had, most recently, been serving DC's 8th ward since 2005.

As mayor, he pushed for economic development and also worked to appoint more blacks to city government positions.</p> \n<p>But alongside his accomplishments, Barry also committed some serious missteps.

After completing drug rehabilitation, he was elected again to city council in 1992 and then again reelected as mayor in 1994. Still, he never fully escaped scandal.

(Clayton Chase / Getty)</p> \n<p>It's clear that the Alliance both wants to elect Democrats, and supports pushing progressive priorities of some kind. Beyond that, their interests can be murky. In <i>The Argument</i>, Matt Bai wrote that the Alliance's original partners ""didn't share any single, identifiable philosophy. They were united by their revulsion toward the Republican majority, and they shared a common nostalgia for what the Democratic Party had once achieved, but they had arrived at no consensus about the kind of government they envisioned next.""</p> \n<p>In the ensuing years, the Alliance has tried — and sometimes struggled — to strike a balance between funding groups that tend to support President Obama and the Democratic Party, versus more ""outsider"" groups who want to push the party more to the left via criticism of the administration and incumbent politicians. These tensions came to the fore in 2012, when the Alliance seemed to be taking an increasingly partisan path rather than an outsider one, as the Huffington Post's <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/02/28/democracy-alliance-dumps-_n_1306867.html"">Ryan Grim</a> and Politico's <a href=""http://dyn.politico.com/printstory.cfm?uuid=7B0C855B-404D-4ABB-BC3D-1FB38DC576A0"" target=""_blank"">Ken Vogel</a> have reported.</p> \n<p>In early 2014, the group's new president Gara LaMarche wrote (in <a href=""http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/lamarche-presentation.pdf"">an internal presentation</a> later obtained by the Free Beacon) that there was a sense the Alliance had ""become a bit stalled"" and may have lost some ""strategic focus."" So LaMarche proposed refocusing the group's strategy on four major areas:</p> \n<ol> \n<li>Democracy: protecting voting rights, reducing the influence of money in politics, a focus on the 2020 redistricting, and protecting the courts.</li> \n<li>Economic inequality: increasing wages for low-income workers, restoring the social safety net, and new thinking about a fair economy. (On that final item, LaMarche's presentation says, ""Our policy agenda on this most critical of issues is a little thin."")</li> \n<li>States: state institutions, long-term work in the South and West, winning progressive victories in blue states, and ""countering ALEC with a network of progressive lawmakers.""</li> \n<li>Rising American electorate: new ""engagement funds"" focusing on Latinos, African-Americans, young people, and women. (LaMarche wants to expand these to include Asian-Americans and working class whites.)</li> \n</ol> \n<p>This agenda seems to heavily focus on electoral victories and building a Democratic (and progressive) electoral majority, rather than on outside advocacy about liberal issues.

(Jim Watson/AFP)</p> \n<h3>Why DREAMers' parents aren't protected by Obama's new actions</h3> \n<p>The broad contours of what Obama would be doing on immigration became clear about a week before <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/11/20/7257469/obama-immigration-order-speech/in/7019390"">the president's formal announcement</a>: he'd be expanding the DACA program to eliminate some of the age restrictions, and would create a new program for parents of US citizens and green-card holders. But even at that point, the administration still hadn't made up its mind about whether or not to include the parents of DACA recipients in the new relief program as well.</p> \n<p>A day or two before the announcement, the administration decided to exclude them. The reasoning, which they laid out carefully in an<a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/olc/opinions/attachments/2014/11/20/2014-11-19-auth-prioritize-removal.pdf""> official legal memo, </a>was that they felt they could give relief to DREAMers themselves for ""humanitarian"" reasons, and they felt they could give relief to parents of US citizens and legal residents because they'd eventually be eligible for legal status anyway.</p> \n<p>But providing the DACA program to DREAMers, and then expanding relief to their parents, would be piling one executive action on top of another — letting a group of unauthorized immigrants qualify for relief simply because of their relationship to another group that had qualified for relief. And they felt that was a bridge too far.</p> \n<p>Many advocates have rejected this reasoning — after all, it's grounded more in precedent than it is in any specific part of immigration law. But it's also clear that the administration wanted to be able to claim to critics, and even in court (if congressional Republicans try to sue to stop the new program), that they saw <i style=""font-size: 1.15em; line-height: 1.65;"">some </i>limit to what the president could do on immigration. By having a group to point to that was deliberately left out, the administration is able to make the case that it was guided by the law — not solely by a desire to please constituents.</p> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2488752/459362598.0.jpg"" alt=""Young activists watch President Obama"" data-chorus-asset-id=""2488752""></p> \n<p class=""caption"" style=""text-align: start;"">Young advocates watch Obama's immigration speech with mixed emotions. (Bill Clark/CQ-Roll Call)</p> \n<p>The administration was also boxed in by the way it's chosen to talk about the original DACA program — it's cast DREAMers as victims, as children brought here ""through no fault of their own,"" who need to be allowed to stay simply for humanitarian reasons. That's a frame that young unauthorized immigrants themselves had deliberately moved away from even before DACA was established — because they recognized that it made them look good at the cost of making their parents look bad. They didn't feel it was their parents' ""fault"" they'd brought their children to the US — they saw it as an act of courage. That's where the phrase ""original DREAMers"" comes from.</p> \n<p>Ironically, the way the administration's plan was characterized in early leaks — parents of children who were under 18 — very few parents of DACA recipients would have been included. Immigrants aren't eligible for DACA before the age of 16; the Migration Policy Institute <a href=""http://www.migrationpolicy.org/research/executive-action-unauthorized-immigrants-estimates-populations-could-receive-relief"">estimated</a> that only about 70,000 parents had one unauthorized-immigrant child between the ages of 16 and 18, but no US citizen or legal resident children.</p> \n<p>As it turns out, the Obama administration's final plan would have included many more. There's no age cap on how old a US citizen or legal-resident child has to be for the parent to qualify for the program. That means hundreds of thousands more parents of DACA recipients could have qualified, if they'd been eligible.</p> \n<h3>Will families who've been left out keep fighting?</h3> \n<p>Even though parents of DACA recipients aren't automatically eligible for relief, many of them will in fact qualify for the new program — because while their older children came here as immigrants and now have DACA, their younger ones were born in the US and are citizens. But for DACA recipients themselves, that split feels arbitrary. One leading activist group told me that of the DREAMers they had staying in DC to lobby last week, about half of their parents are included in the new program; the other half aren't.</p> \n<p>They say they're going to continue fighting for relief to get expanded even further. But with only two years of Obama left, and the possibility of a future Republican president who could reverse even the existing deportation-protection programs, it's going to be an uphill battle. Meanwhile, many of the leading activists who are DACA recipients put their lives on hold during the campaign that led to last week's announcement: they've left or postponed grad school, or split their time between their hometowns and DC. Many of them have been doing full-time advocacy for several years. If some of them decided they were tired of fighting, and wanted to get on with their lives, it would be understandable.</p> \n<hr> \n<b>UPDATE:</b> This article was updated to be as explicit as possible that parents of DREAMers who also have children who are US citizens or legal permanent residents will be eligible for protection from deportation under President Obama's executive actions.",Politics
Obama vows veto of bipartisan corporate tax deal,http://www.vox.com/2014/11/25/7277935/tax-extenders-deal,"Treasury Secretary Jack Lew calls a reported deal ""fiscally irresponsible.""","<ol> \n<li>President Obama is <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/26/business/congress-nears-deal-on-major-business-tax-breaks.html"" target=""_blank"">prepared to veto</a> a bipartisan package of business tax breaks that House and Senate negotiators are close to finalizing.</li> \n<li>The deal would make several corporate tax breaks permanent without offsetting the cost in any way, while failing to extend provisions of the Child Tax Credit and Earned Income Tax Credit that are favorable to low-income households.</li> \n<li>In a statement, Treasury Secretary Jack Lew described the proposal as ""fiscally irresponsible"" and said ""any deal on tax extenders must ensure that the economic benefits are broadly shared.""</li> \n</ol> \n<h3><span>The tax extender impasse</span></h3> \n<p>The origin of the fight is a package of 55 or 56 (we'll return to that in a moment) corporate income tax breaks that at one time or another were inserted into the tax code as temporary provisions. Typically these breaks were made temporary so as to reduce their notional cost in CBO scores, rather than because their proponents actually wanted them to be temporary. Consequently, extension of the tax breaks upon expiration became routine — hence the name ""tax extenders.""</p> \n<p>Keeping the breaks temporary rather than making them permanent was a convenient way to mask the cost. It also required a continual merry-go-round of lobbying over their extension, which served members of Congress' purposes well. The tax breaks have traditionally enjoyed bipartisan support, since a few of the larger ones serve as a subsidy for renewable energy production and because the Research &amp; Development tax credit is pretty broadly believed to be good public policy.</p> \n<p>In addition to the 55 traditional tax extenders, there is the ""bonus depreciation"" tax cut. This lets companies take a larger tax writeoff for investment expenses than would otherwise be possible. It was introduced as a recession-fighting temporary measure that really was supposed to be temporary, but the businesses who profit off it would like it to stay permanent.</p> \n<p>Back about a year ago, something unusual happened and congress <i>didn't</i> extend the tax extenders. But all year the expectation on K Street and in corporate America has been that the extenders will be <i>retroactively</i> extended at the end of 2014.</p> \n<h3>Working class tax cuts</h3> \n<p>Joining the party in 2009 were two provisions of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (aka, ""the stimulus"") that made the Child Tax Credit (CTC) and the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) more generous to low-income working families on a temporary basis. As part of the 2012 fiscal cliff deal, Democrats extended these tax cuts out to the end of 2016.</p> \n<p>Democrats would like these measures to be made permanent. Indeed, most Democrats and some Republicans agree that the <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/7/25/5934857/eitc-ryan-obama-expansion-poverty"" target=""_blank"">EITC should actually be made even more generous</a>. But there is no agreement as to how to offset any proposed enhancements in the EITC.</p> \n<h3>What everyone's bargaining for</h3> \n<p>There are two aspects to the ongoing negotiations, which are somewhat in tension with one another. On the one hand, more liberal members would like to minimize the fiscal burden of the tax extenders by extending them for a limited period of time and by excluding bonus depreciation. On the other hand, more liberal members would like to see the EITC and CTC breaks extended, which would increase the fiscal cost.</p> \n<p>Conversely, Republicans are aiming to maximize the volume of business tax breaks while minimizing the volume of assistance to the working poor. A deal to make the extenders permanent while doing nothing on EITC/CTC would accomplish exactly none of liberals' goals, thus the negative take from the White House. But Democratic Senators involved in the deal argue that the administration and liberal critics in their own caucus aren't thinking realistically about the consequences of failure to reach a deal. They fear a massive backlash from the business community (including elements that are sympathetic to Democrats) without any substantial interest from the mass public that could be leveraged in their favor.</p>",Politics
"Report: Sheldon Adelson thinks Ted Cruz is ""too right wing"" to win the presidency",http://www.vox.com/2014/11/26/7285405/cruz-adelson-conservative,"According to a New York Observer report, the GOP megadonor isn't too keen on the Texas Senator's chances in 2016.","<p>Casino magnate Sheldon Adelson is one of the most important donors in the Republican party.

So it is a big deal that Adelson reportedly dismissed Sen. Ted Cruz, thought to be a top contender for the 2016 GOP presidential nomination, as ""too right wing"" and ""a longshot.""</p> \n<p>That's based on a report by the <a href=""http://observer.com/2014/11/sen-ted-cruz-16-presidential-hopeful-woos-new-york-jewish-donors/#ixzz3K6x8WWxJ"" target=""_blank"">New York Observer</a>'s Ken Kurson, who quotes what he calls ""one source close to Adelson."" Adelson allegedly said this after speaking to Cruz spoke at a recent Zionist Organization for America dinner. The day after the dinner, Adelson and Cruz met again for two hours at a hotel. Afterwards, Adelson concluded that Cruz is too conservative to be a likely GOP primary winner, according to the New York Observer's anonymous source.</p> \n<p>Israel is Adelson's top issue (aside from <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/gop-megadonor-sheldon-adelson-faces-conservative-rebellion-over-online-gambling/2014/11/20/b0b03318-6f44-11e4-ad12-3734c461eab6_story.html"" target=""_blank"">banning the online gambling sites</a> that threaten his casino empire), so this meeting was a big chance for Cruz to impress him.</p> \n<p>The implication of this quote appears to be that Adelson doesn't himself object to Cruz's politics, but merely thinks they make him unelectable even in today's Republican Party. Indeed, the conservative Texas Senator has managed to <a href=""http://time.com/2842539/ted-cruz-republicans-2016/"" target=""_blank"">alienate a massive chunk of the Republican establishment</a>, party elites whose support is critical in the all-important ""<a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/4/8/5593294/why-rand-paul-isnt-the-gop-presidential-frontrunner"" target=""_blank"">invisible primary</a>.""</p> \n<p>Adelson's view of the Republican presidential field matter.

Adelson's support could make or break a bid for the GOP nomination. If Cruz has lost him, that's a major blow.</p> \n<p><b>Update</b>: Adelson got in touch with the Observer after the report went out. According to Kurson, ""Mr. Adelson called the Observer after publication of this story to dispute that characterization of his reaction to Mr. Cruz.

Which time was he right?,http://www.vox.com/2014/12/2/7321607/obama-immigration-flip-flop,Republicans say Obama can't dictate what actions are legal. But they're trying to cite Obama to prove it,"<p>As Republicans try to fight back against <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/11/20/7255349/obama-immigration-reform"">President Obama's recent executive actions on immigration</a> by arguing they were illegal or unconstitutional, they've found an interesting constitutional authority who supports their case: President Obama, circa 2011.</p> \n<h3>Obama flip-flopped on his immigration powers</h3> \n<p>In the early years of the Obama administration, in 2010 and 2011, the president <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/9/7/6116367/obama-immigration-strategy-work-republicans-delay-elections"">argued repeatedly</a> that he wasn't able to do anything more than he was already doing to protect immigrants from deportation. In 2012, however, he rolled out the<a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/11/19/7229439/daca-immigration-executive-action/in/7019390""> Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program</a>, which allowed over a million unauthorized immigrants to apply for temporary deportation protection (and is the program that Obama's new executive actions are build on). That's exactly the kind of broad relief that immigrant activists had been calling for in 2011, and that Obama had said he wasn't able to do.</p> \n<p>After introducing DACA, the administration said once more that it couldn't do anything more to protect immigrants — but flip-flopped again in 2014, when the administration announced a broad review of deportation policy to see how it could be made more humane.</p> \n<p>Now, after announcing his latest executive actions, President Obama maintains that he never contradicted himself. Check out the 1:15 mark of this interview with ABC's George Stephanopoulos:</p> \n<p><iframe src=""http://abcnews.go.com/video/embed?id=27115743"" width=""640"" height=""360"" scrolling=""no"" style=""border:none;""></iframe></p> \n<p>If this sounds like a lame defense, it's because it is. Obama has said, on multiple occasions, that he couldn't ""wave a magic wand"" to protect immigrants from deportation. As the <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/18/us/by-using-executive-order-on-immigration-obama-would-reverse-long-held-stance.html"">New York Times</a> has pointed out, the suggestions Obama was rejecting around 2011 were exactly the proposals he's adopting now. Speaker John Boehner's office has compiled a <a style=""font-size: 1.15em; line-height: 1.65; background-color: #ffffff;"" href=""http://www.speaker.gov/general/22-times-president-obama-said-he-couldn-t-ignore-or-create-his-own-immigration-law"">fact sheet</a> of various times President Obama said that, when it comes to immigration, he was unable to do the thing that he just did in November. And during a House Judiciary Committee hearing, chairman Bob Goodlatte played a video that compiled several of those quotes into a clip reel.</p> \n<p>They're not just using old statements, either. Republicans are also pointing to a speech President Obama gave in Nevada, the day after announcing his executive actions, in which he refers to those actions as ""chang(ing) the law.""</p> \n<h3>That doesn't mean he was right the first time</h3> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2511490/487187871.0.jpg"" alt=""immigration protesters"" data-chorus-asset-id=""2511490""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">(Chip Somodevilla/Getty)</p> \n<p>Where the GOP runs into trouble is that they're not just using Obama's past statements to show that the president flip-flopped. They're trying to use them as proof that the new executive actions are officially unconstitutional, or at least illegal.</p> \n<p>This is a weirdly circular argument. The GOP is saying that the president isn't the authority on whether an action is legal, that 2014-edition Obama can't make his executive actions legal just by saying they are. But they're trying to prove that by using the president's words in his November Nevada speech as the authority on whether what he did was a change to the law, and his words in 2011 as the authority on whether it was legal to do that.</p> \n<p>But what he was saying in 2011 was wrong.</p> \n<p>Under the Immigration and Nationality Act, president has a lot of authority to decide who to deport and who not to deport — and what to do with the latter. That doesn't require a change to the law — no matter what Obama said in Nevada.</p> \n<p>And despite Obama's earlier protestations, his administration never actually built a legal case in 2011 to say that it <i>didn't</i> have the authority to protect people from deportation. The first time the Obama administration  issued a legal memo defending its immigration policy was last month, and it was to show why the new executive actions were legal. That memo made it pretty clear that the Obama administration doesn't think it was really changing the law when it took these actions.</p> \n<p>In retrospect, it seems pretty clear that what Obama was saying in 2011 was about politics, not law. He was using ""I can't, legally, do anything"" as cover, because he didn't think that executive action to protect unauthorized immigrants would be a good idea. He wanted to try Plan A — passing a law — instead. When that failed in 2013, he changed his mind, and decided that executive action was the best option available.</p> \n<p>It would be nice if the White House acknowledged this, and admitted the flip-flop, rather than trying to pretend the president's been consistent. But their spin doesn't affect the underlying question of legality.</p> \n<p>As for the Nevada speech comments, you can see that as a sinister revelation of the his true feelings, or you can see it as a slip of the tongue: like <a href=""http://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2012/10/obamas_freudian_slip_he_wants_to_export_jobs.html"">the time he said </a>""I want to see us export more jobs."" (Press secretary Josh Earnest said the president was speaking ""colloquially,"" which doesn't make any sense — and sounds like an attempt to avoid saying the president slipped up.) Even if Obama does actually think that his administration changed immigration law, the legal memos from the administration establish that he'd be wrong.</p> \n<p>The GOP successfully caught Obama on the flip-flop — but he flip-flopped from being wrong to being right. And if they're going to make the case that the president can't dictate what the law is, they're going to have a hard time using the president as their authority on the subject.</p>",Politics

So it's of some small comfort that when the conversation turned to politics, Rock endorsed a genuinely wrong theory of the Obama presidency.</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p><b>What has Obama done wrong?</b></p> \n<p>When Obama first got elected, he should have let it all just drop.</p> \n<p><b>Let what drop?</b></p> \n<p>Just let the country flatline. Let the auto industry die. Don’t bail anybody out. In sports, that’s what any new GM does. They make sure that the catastrophe is on the old management and then they clean up. They don’t try to save old management’s mistakes.</p> \n<p><b>That’s clever. You let it all go to hell.</b></p> \n<p>Let it all go to hell knowing good and well this is on them. That way you can implement. You hire your own coach. You get your own players. He could have got way more done. You know, we’ve all been on planes that had tremendous turbulence, but we forget all about it. Now, if you live through a plane crash, you’ll never forget that. Maybe Obama should have let the plane crash. You get credit for bringing somebody back from the dead. You don’t really get credit for helping a sick person by administering antibiotics.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>The big problem with this idea — which I've heard other liberals propose in the past — is it's morally odious: it would have meant putting millions of Americans through harrowing pain in order to help Obama out politically. If a GM lets a team flatline the team loses a few games. If the president lets the country's financial sector flatline millions of people's lives are destroyed.</p> \n<p><span>But the other problem with this idea is it would have be a political disaster for any president, including Obama, who tried it. </span></p> \n<p>The key fact about Obama's early presidency is, whether he wanted it to or not, it did just all drop.</p> \n<p>Obama was elected in November of 2008. The unemployment rate was 6.8 percent. He took office in January of 2009. The unemployment rate was 7.8 percent. By October of that year, the unemployment rate was 10 percent.</p> \n<p>This was the insoluble political problem of Obama's first term: he took office, <i>and then it all got worse</i>. Administration economists could protest all they wanted that they stopped a deep recession from becoming another Great Depression — and they probably did. But you don't make friends with counterfactuals. ""It's bad, but it could've been terrible"" is a crappy bumper sticker.</p> \n<h3>The ""let it burn"" strategy</h3> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2514052/15215884889_43388ed795_o.0.jpg"" alt=""obama worried"" data-chorus-asset-id=""2514052""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Pete Rouse/White House</p> \n<p>What Rock is suggesting is that Obama's political situation would have improved if he had stood back and let it get <i>much worse even than it did</i>. So Obama takes office and lets the banks collapse. He takes office and lets the car companies collapse. He allows a great and cleansing economic fire to sweep across the nation. And then, when unemployment hits 23 percent and the breadlines snake through the streets and the Republican Party is burnt to a crisp, he begins to rebuild.</p> \n<p>There are a few problems with this. First, a worse financial crisis would also have meant a harder-to-fix financial crisis. There would have been that many more people to put back to work, that much less credit to fund the businesses that might hire them, that many fewer car companies to employ them, that much more government debt to turn members of Congress against stimulus. Even if Obama could have gotten more done, the opportunity would've been overwhelmed by how much more there would have been to do.</p> \n<p>Second, no president remains popular amidst skyrocketing unemployment. When the economy dipped in 1937, Democrats lost 78 House and seven Senate seats in the next election. If FDR had been on the ballot he almost certainly would have been defeated. When the Federal Reserve sent unemployment into the double-digits in 1982, Ronald Reagan's party lost 27 House seats and the late David Broder declared that his presidency was in ""its phase-out."" There are basically no examples of a <span>president getting more popular even as unemployment rises sharply.</span></p> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2514074/gallup_obama_bush_economy.0.jpg"" alt=""gallup_obama_bush_economy.0.jpg"" data-chorus-asset-id=""2514074""></p> \n<p class=""caption""><a href=""http://www.gallup.com/poll/155177/americans-blame-bush-obama-bad-economy.aspx"">Gallup</a></p> \n<p>Plus, Americans already did the thing Rock wanted them to do: they blamed Bush even as the economy worsened under Obama. In June 2012, three years into Obama's presidency, <a href=""http://www.gallup.com/poll/155177/americans-blame-bush-obama-bad-economy.aspx"">68 percent</a> blamed Bush for the state of the economy, while only 52 percent blamed Obama. In February 2014, the situation was roughly unchanged: a <a href=""http://www.msnbc.com/politicsnation/poll-economy-bush-obama"">plurality</a> of Americans still placed most of the blame on Bush for the state of the economy.</p> \n<p>Americans were right to believe that Obama inherited the bulk of the economic crisis. But the strategy Rock counsels here would have made them wrong. It would have turned the depth of the recession from something Obama inherited to something he permitted. And my hunch is the backlash would have been fierce, and justified.</p> \n<p>But this does give way to one of the more interesting counterfactuals of the Obama era: What if Obama had taken office a bit later? The 20th Amendment to the Constitution, ratified in 1933, moved the beginning of the president's term from March 4th to January 20th. By March of 2009, unemployment had hit 8.7 percent, and the depth and power of the recession was coming clear. What would the stimulus debate have looked like in that world? How much readier to cooperate would Congress have been in that world?</p> \n<p>The FDR example is instructive here. As Theda Skocpol and Lawrence Jacobs point out in ""<a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0871548550?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=washpost-politics-20&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creativeASIN=0871548550"">Reaching For a New Deal</a>"", Roosevelt won the presidency in 1932. The Great Depression was three years old at that point, and unemployment was 23.6 percent. Obama won the presidency in 2008, mere months into his economic crisis. FDR's timing was better for his presidency — though worse for the country — than Obama's; the<span> only surefire way for a president to escape all blame for an economic disaster is to have someone else be president when it happens.</span></p>",Politics

DC's legalization initiative costs nothing; it actually <i>saves</i> the district money to not enforce laws against marijuana possession. The ballot measure actually couldn't cost money in the first place, since DC ballot initiatives, by law, can't have a direct impact on the local budget.</p> \n<p>But the House provision would prohibit DC Council from spending its time and resources to approve the legalization initiative and send it to Congress. Under federal law, that's a necessary step for legalization to take effect.</p> \n<p>And if DC Council tries to pass a law that would tax and regulate the sales of marijuana, as Mayor-elect Muriel Bowser supports, that would also face certain doom under the House provision. A tax-and-regulate bill would cost money, and Congress could easily block such a bill through its budgetary supervision of DC's local laws.</p> \n<h3>The provision would need approval from the Senate and White House</h3> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2515484/116227560.0.jpg"" alt=""White House"" data-chorus-asset-id=""2515484""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">The White House.

The House just passed its first attempt to stop Obama on immigration,http://www.vox.com/2014/12/4/7335189/republican-immigration-plan,It won't go anywhere.,"<ol> \n<li><span>The House of Representatives has passed a bill that would stop President Obama from letting millions of unauthorized immigrants apply for protection from deportation.</span></li> \n<li><span>The bill passed 216-197, with seven Republicans voting against it (and three Democrats voting in favor).</span></li> \n<li><span>The bill is almost certainly not going to become law. Democrats won't bring it up in the Senate before the end of this Congress, at the end of the month.</span></li> \n<li><span>Republicans may bring the bill up again next year, when they control both chambers of Congress. But the administration has already promised to veto it, and Republicans won't have large enough majorities to override the veto.</span></li> \n<li><span>The bill might also end the US' current policy toward Cuban immigration, which allows for essentially unlimited migration to the US.</span></li> \n</ol> \n<h3>What would the bill actually do?</h3> \n<p>The bill the House just passed would ban the Department of Homeland Security from giving relief from deportation, or work permits, to any ""category"" of immigrants who are here unlawfully, or who come unlawfully. The government could still issue protections from deportation — but they would have to be on a case-by-case basis.</p> \n<p><q class=""center"" aria-hidden=""true"">according to the administration, the bill wouldn't ban anything the president is actually doing</q></p> \n<p>Republicans believe that this would prevent President Obama from implementing the executive actions he announced last month, which would allow about three and a half million unauthorized immigrants to apply for protection from deportation and work permits. But here's the problem for Republicans: the Obama administration maintains that its new program <i>is </i>""case-by-case,"" not categorical. So according to the administration, even if the bill somehow passed into law — which it's extremely unlikely to do — it wouldn't actually ban anything the president is actually doing.</p> \n<h3>Are Republicans trying to take away protections from unauthorized immigrants who've already gotten them?</h3> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/653520/150318941__1_.0.jpg"" alt=""daca clinic"" data-chorus-asset-id=""653520""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">People attend an orientation class in filing up their application for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program</p> \n<p>There are over 600,000 unauthorized immigrants who've already gotten temporary protection from deportation and work permits thanks to the Obama administration. They applied under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which was introduced in 2012.</p> \n<p>The bill the House just passed isn't retroactive — it would only apply to immigrants who sought protection from deportation after November 20. So it wouldn't take protection away from the immigrants who've already been protected by DACA (or immigrants whose DACA applications have been submitted, but not approved yet).</p> \n<p>But DACA only lasts for two years, and the bill would prohibit immigrants from getting their DACA protections renewed. So as DACA grants run out over the next two years, those immigrants would, one by one, become vulnerable to deportation again.</p> \n<h3>Would the bill just apply to President Obama's policies?</h3> \n<p>The bill is pretty broad, and it could definitely apply to some longer-standing policies as well. Most notably, it's possible that banning ""categorical"" relief would end the ""wet foot, dry foot"" policy that allows Cuban defectors to stay in the US. House Judiciary Committee chairman Bob Goodlatte said that the bill wouldn't affect Cubans, because there's an existing law that allows all Cubans to get relief in the US — but the text of the bill itself doesn't actually carve out an exception for existing law.</p> \n<p>Republicans have historically been staunch defenders of ""wet foot, dry foot,"" so it's notable that they weren't more explicit in carving out an exception.</p> \n<h3>Did any Republicans think this was a bad idea?</h3> \n<p>Seven Republicans voted against the bill. Five of them are pro-immigration or moderate Republicans, who've voted against previous attempts to expand deportation. The other two (Rep. Louie Gohmert and Rep. Marlin Stutzman) are hard-liners, who voted against the bill because it didn't go far enough. Three other House conservatives (including leading immigration hawk Steve King) voted ""present,"" for the same reason.</p> \n<h3>What more can Republicans do to try to stop the president's immigration actions?</h3> \n<p>Republicans are still figuring out whether they want to try to defund the Department of Homeland Security unless the president ends the new relief program. Speaker of the House John Boehner has floated the idea of passing a bill now that would only fund DHS for a few months (while the rest of the government was funded through fall 2015), so that Congress could decide what to do in the spring. But some conservatives want to pass a bill that would restrict DHS from getting any money <i>now, </i>unless the president agreed to end the program.</p>",Politics

Earlier this year, for the first time that Flemish nationalist party entered a governing coalition at the federal level. Historically that hasn't been possible because the French-speaking parties wouldn't collaborate with the Flemish nationalists. What's new is that Charles Michel (the guy pelted with fries in the video) decided to make an exception to that rule.</p> \n<p>Michel runs the Mouvement Reformateur (French for reform movement) which is a Francophone free market party. He agreed to lead a coalition government that includes the New Flemish Alliance provided that the government focus exclusively on economic issues, rather than constitutional and linguistic ones.</p> \n<p>Since the Flemish side of Belgium is richer than the French side, implementing a free market economic agenda tends to be objectively pro-Flemish. Consequently, the coalition math of Francophone free marketers plus Dutch-speakers works. But it rocks the boat of Belgian politics, and is very upsetting to the majority of French-speakers. Which is how, in a nutshell, you end up with the Prime Minister of Belgium having a speech interrupted by a protestor throwing food and shouting anti-austerity slogans in French.</p>",Politics

""In Iraq and Syria,"" the President said, ""American leadership — including our military power — is stopping [ISIS]'s advance.""</p> \n<p>The phrasing here is careful. Obama isn't claiming that the US has ISIS on the brink of defeat: indeed, the United States has made very little progress towards pushing ISIS out of its core strongholds in Iraq and Syria. Though Obama claims the American goal is ""degrading and ultimately defeating [ISIS],"" that's not happening anytime soon.</p> \n<p>But Obama's more modest claim — that ISIS's advance in the two countries has been seriously slowed and America deserves (some) credit — is correct.

In Iraq, the US is working with the central Iraqi government and the quasi-autonomous Kurdistan Regional Government. In Syria, America's friends are a group of rag-tag militias who are currently being hammered by ISIS, Jabhat al-Nusra (al-Qaeda's Syrian branch), and the Syrian government.</p> \n<p>So there are really two American military strategies. First, support the Iraqi effort to dislodge ISIS from its strongholds in western and northern Iraq. That's happening now, and with a lot of Iraqi help, it's actually been somewhat successful. Second, use airstrikes in Syria to support the Iraq effort and contain ISIS until the US can build up strong local allies (which is not yet happening, would be far more difficult, and indeed, may never happen).</p> \n<h3><span>America has had some real successes against ISIS</span></h3> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/666582/453782456.0.jpg"" alt=""peshmerga isis"" data-chorus-asset-id=""666582""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Kurdish troops next to a destroyed ISIS truck. (Ahmad al-Rubaye/AFP/Getty Images)</p> \n<p>In military terms, America's strategy has been remarkably successful, at least in Iraq. Since airstrikes began in August, US and allied bombs have made it difficult for ISIS to mass its troops in the open. That makes it hard for the group to orchestrate large-scale offensives. Airstrikes have also <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/11/7/7173665/isis-oil-money"">blown up ISIS oil facilities</a>, making it harder for the group to raise cash.</p> \n<p>The US-trained Iraqi forces have successfully adapted to ISIS's blitzkrieg tactics and have pushed the group out of several important areas. By late October, ISIS's <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/10/28/7079695/isis-iraq-syria-defeat"">offensive momentum had stalled out</a>.</p> \n<p>Recently, ISIS has begun suffering more defeats. The most significant such setback in Iraq was in Sinjar, a critical supply line between ISIS territory in Syria and ISIS-held Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city. In December, Kurdish troops finally pushed <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://dish.andrewsullivan.com/2014/12/29/has-the-tide-turned-against-isis/"">ISIS fighters</a> out of the town, which they had held for months. While ISIS is still <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://iswiraq.blogspot.com/2015/01/iraq-situation-report-january-17-18-2015.html?utm_source=Iraq+Situation+Report%3A+January+17-18%2C+2015&amp;utm_campaign=ISW+New+Iraq+update&amp;utm_medium=email"">contesting the region</a>, the fact that it's now battling for a strategically important area it used to control handily is a testament to its weakened state.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, in Syria, ISIS hasn't made major gains. While it's still firmly in control of territory including Raqaa, its eastern stronghold, the group has had trouble expanding its holdings, in part because Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad is finally taking them on.</p> \n<p>""All of their major offensives since the airstrikes began (Kobane, Dayr al-Zawr Air Base, Sha'ir Gas Field) have either been stalemates or ended in outright defeat once they squared off against Assad's troops,"" Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, a senior fellow at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies, told me. ISIS has made some smaller gains in Syria, Gartenstein-Ross allows, but they aren't strategic game-changers.</p> \n<p>So Obama is absolutely right. ISIS's advance is being stopped, and American airpower deserves some of the credit.</p> \n<h3>Still, ISIS isn't anywhere near the brink of defeat</h3> \n<p><iframe width=""1280"" height=""720"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/6SPzfGFOJ84"" frameborder=""0""></iframe></p> \n<p>Let's not give the administration too much credit. Stopping ISIS's advance is a very different thing from actually defeating the group.</p> \n<p>""Airpower alone is insufficient to defeat ISIS or even degrade it seriously,"" Jason Lyall, a Yale University expert on counterinsurgency, wrote via email. ""Instead, its role is to make ISIS work harder to control and extend its territory while buying time for the Iraqi Army.""</p> \n<p>It's not clear if the Iraqis can overcome the fundamental problems that gave rise to ISIS in the first place. The conflict between Iraq's majority Shias and minority Sunnis fuels ISIS; Iraqi Sunnis don't trust the Shia-dominated government to represent them fairly. So long as they're willing to at least tolerate ISIS rather than actively support a pro-government rebellion, it'll be very hard to dislodge ISIS from its Iraqi strongholds.</p> \n<p>In other words, one of the most important fronts in the war is in Baghdad politics, and with a whole lot of US pressure there have been some gains there. <span>Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi is better than his predecessor, Nouri al-Maliki, but still hasn't come close to </span><a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jan/18/lack-politial-process-iraq-renders-us-coalition-bombs-grave-mistake?CMP=twt_gu"" style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.65;"">reconciling the Sunni and Shia communities</a><span>. </span><span>There are a number of reforms Abadi could stand to implement, such as opening more government posts for Sunnis or tamping down pro-government Shia militias.</span></p> \n<p>And that's just Iraq, the ""easy"" half of the strategy.

And there's little indication that the US is able or willing to address the root cause of ISIS's rise in Syria, which is the cruelty of Bashar al-Assad's regime and its anti-Sunni sectarian politics.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, Syria is actually getting worse.

The document that resulted from this exercise, <a href=""http://strategytheory.org/military/us/joint_board/Estimate%20of%20the%20Situation%20-%20Red%20and%20Tentative%20Joint%20Basic%20Plan%20-%20Red.pdf"">War Plan Red</a>, was approved by the War Department in 1930 and not declassified until the 1970s. It assumed that Britain would start the war with a slightly larger navy and much larger army than the United States, so the key to American strategy was to start an essentially defensive effort until greater US industrial might could be brought to bear to construct a navy capable of blockading Britain. But the best way to defend the United States from a British invasion was to launch a preemptive invasion of Canada (code named Crimson), then still part of the British Empire. The first target was to be a quick amphibious assault on Halifax, Nova Scotia, which would deny Britain a convenient Canadian port and make it difficult for it to support Canada's military. Then two parallel invasion forces would head north from North Dakota and Vermont aimed at captured Winnipeg (a key rail junction) and Québec City (thus preventing the use of the St. Lawrence River as an alternate port) respectively. Actual British thinking about war with the United States at the time regarded Canada as indefensible and called for the use of Bermuda and Caribbean bases as jumping-off points for attacks on American commerce.</p> \n</div> \n<div class=""feature-photos-share-tools"">\n<a class=""feature-photos-share-tool twitter"" data-source=""feature-list-item"" data-social=""Twitter"" href=""javascript:void(0);""></a> <a class=""feature-photos-share-tool facebook"" data-source=""feature-list-item"" data-social=""Facebook"" href=""javascript:void(0);""></a>\n</div> \n</li> \n<li id=""list-item-2"" class=""list-2 clearfix feature-photos-list-item""> \n<div class=""feature-photos-photo feature-photos-column"">\n<a href=""http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2449512/Screen_Shot_2014-11-11_at_8.53.47_PM.0.png"" target=""_black""><img class=""lazy zoom"" data-src=""http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2449512/Screen_Shot_2014-11-11_at_8.53.47_PM.0.png""></a> <a href=""http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2449512/Screen_Shot_2014-11-11_at_8.53.47_PM.0.png"" target=""_blank"" class=""icon-link-ext-alt""></a> \n<p class=""feature-photos-caption""><a href=""https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Operation_Downfall_-_Map.jpg"">US military academy</a></p> \n</div> \n<div class=""feature-photos-story feature-photos-column""> \n<h4>Operation Downfall: The invasion of Japan</h4> \n<p>Before the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki convinced Japan to surrender, the US military was planning a massive invasion of the Japanese home islands.

Kyushu was the target because an amphibious landing on its southern coast could be supported by aircraft based on the previously conquered island of Okinawa.

In their place would come ethnically German settlers and their descendents. Between the dashed line and the Ural Mountains, in central Russia east of Moscow, there were to be German-run military regimes that would prevent the re-emergence of any form of the Russian state. The city of Moscow itself was to be <a href=""http://www.zeit.de/zeit-geschichte/2011/02/Kriegsziele-Generalplan-Ost/seite-2"">flooded through the demolition of a key dam</a>, destroying the city and replacing it with a lake.

In the event the United States declared war on Germany, the ambassador was instructed to approach the Mexican government with a proposed alliance. Germany would help fund a military campaign to allow Mexico to retake some of the territory lost in the Mexican-American war seven decades earlier. This map shows Zimmermann's proposal: Texas, Arizona, and New Mexico would be annexed into Mexico (the red line shows Mexican territory before 1845). But the Brits were tapping undersea cables between Europe and the United States, and had broken Germany's codes. They deciphered Zimmerman's message and passed a copy to the Americans. The release of Zimmermann's telegram inflamed American public opinion and helped to build momentum for a US declaration of war, which occurred on April 6, 1917. Mexico, meanwhile, realized that it would have no hope of defeating the United States and rejected Germany's proposal.</p> \n</div> \n<div class=""feature-photos-share-tools"">\n<a class=""feature-photos-share-tool twitter"" data-source=""feature-list-item"" data-social=""Twitter"" href=""javascript:void(0);""></a> <a class=""feature-photos-share-tool facebook"" data-source=""feature-list-item"" data-social=""Facebook"" href=""javascript:void(0);""></a>\n</div> \n</li> \n<hr> \n<h3>Fantasy Political Reforms</h3> \n<li id=""list-item-7"" class=""list-7 clearfix feature-photos-list-item""> \n<div class=""feature-photos-photo feature-photos-column"">\n<a href=""http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2449624/Texasin5_zpsc81f4e8d.0.JPG"" target=""_black""><img class=""lazy zoom"" data-src=""http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2449624/Texasin5_zpsc81f4e8d.0.JPG""></a> <a href=""http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2449624/Texasin5_zpsc81f4e8d.0.JPG"" target=""_blank"" class=""icon-link-ext-alt""></a> \n<p class=""feature-photos-caption""><a href=""http://s234.photobucket.com/user/KoLDisky/media/Texasin5_zpsc81f4e8d.jpg.html?sort=3&amp;o=11"">Timmy Hunter-Kilmer</a></p> \n</div> \n<div class=""feature-photos-story feature-photos-column""> \n<h4>Five Texases</h4> \n<p>Any Texan (ask my wife, or my former roommate, or Vox's own Kelsey McKinney) will tell you that Texas has the right to unilaterally split into five separate states.

Naturally, there are any number of different ways in which this could be achieved, but my favorite plans follow the basic scheme of this map by Timmy Hunter-Kilmer. The idea is that the state's major cities — Houston, Dallas, San Antonio, and Austin — should each anchor their own state, while a fifth state is composed of the largely empty, largely rural portions of the north and west. This division of Texas would greatly increase Republican representation in the US Senate, as four of the five sub-Texas' would be politically conservative. The blue colored Texas stretching from the Mexican border to San Antonio would, however, be quite left-wing and feature a majority Latino population.</p> \n</div> \n<div class=""feature-photos-share-tools"">\n<a class=""feature-photos-share-tool twitter"" data-source=""feature-list-item"" data-social=""Twitter"" href=""javascript:void(0);""></a> <a class=""feature-photos-share-tool facebook"" data-source=""feature-list-item"" data-social=""Facebook"" href=""javascript:void(0);""></a>\n</div> \n</li> \n<li id=""list-item-8"" class=""list-8 clearfix feature-photos-list-item""> \n<div class=""feature-photos-photo feature-photos-column"">\n<a href=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2500920/Six_Californias.0.png"" target=""_black""><img class=""lazy zoom"" data-src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2500920/Six_Californias.0.png""></a> <a href=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2500920/Six_Californias.0.png"" target=""_blank"" class=""icon-link-ext-alt""></a> \n<p class=""feature-photos-caption""><a href=""http://www.sixcalifornias.com/"">Six Californias</a></p> \n</div> \n<div class=""feature-photos-story feature-photos-column""> \n<h4>Six Californias</h4> \n<p>In December 2013, venture capitalist Tim Draper introduced the world to his proposal to divide California into six smaller states and his intention to put the idea on the ballot as an initiative.

In partisan terms, by packing so many liberals into incredibly lopsided urban states this concept would tilt the college in favor of the GOP. Nate Cohen, for example, has calculated that Mitt Romney would have won a <a href=""http://www.newrepublic.com/article/112467/electoral-college-reform-romney-wins-redrawn-us-map"">narrow electoral college victory</a> under this map in 2012, despite losing the popular vote by four percentage points. But there would be broader policy implications of creating several city-states that wouldn't be subordinated to state legislatures and would send their own urban-focused senators to Washington.

""The US dollar isn't secured by anything,"" Panarin told Izvestia. ""The country's foreign debt has grown like an avalanche; this is a pyramid which has to collapse."" His idea was that after a period of chaos and civil war, the country would split into four pieces, each of which would be aligned with a different foreign power. The suggestion that Kentucky, Tennessee, and South Carolina would naturally align with the northeastern states indicates a questionable level of familiarity with American society.

These <a href=""http://time.com/3100248/high-speed-rail-barack-obama/"">modest though useful efforts</a>, however, always intended to be the downpayment on something larger — a much more ambitious plan to build true high-speed rail connections from coast to coast. Something along those lines was <a href=""http://www.cnn.com/2011/POLITICS/02/08/biden.rail.network/"">announced in February of 2011</a> by Vice President Joe Biden, along with a request for $53 billion to start work. Given the prevailing politics of the time, the plan was dead on arrival in congress. What's more, though the plan proposes some real projects of merit, it also illustrates Amtrak's congenital weakness for spreading itself too thin. Service from Jacksonville to Columbia or Meridian to Birmingham or Little Rock to Texarkana helps build a broader political coalition, but there's little evidence of massive demand on these routes or the existence of overcrowded air corridors in need of relief.</p> \n</div> \n<div class=""feature-photos-share-tools"">\n<a class=""feature-photos-share-tool twitter"" data-source=""feature-list-item"" data-social=""Twitter"" href=""javascript:void(0);""></a> <a class=""feature-photos-share-tool facebook"" data-source=""feature-list-item"" data-social=""Facebook"" href=""javascript:void(0);""></a>\n</div> \n</li> \n<li id=""list-item-13"" class=""list-13 clearfix feature-photos-list-item""> \n<div class=""feature-photos-photo feature-photos-column"">\n<a href=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2500912/NAIPNNetwork.0.jpg"" target=""_black""><img class=""lazy zoom"" data-src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2500912/NAIPNNetwork.0.jpg""></a> <a href=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2500912/NAIPNNetwork.0.jpg"" target=""_blank"" class=""icon-link-ext-alt""></a> \n<p class=""feature-photos-caption"">North America's Supercorridor Coalition, Inc.</p> \n</div> \n<div class=""feature-photos-story feature-photos-column""> \n<h4>NAFTA Superhighway</h4> \n<p>There is no NAFTA Superhighway and there was never a plan to build one.

The highway was not built and the area was eventually revitalized. During the mid-20th century, destroying the fabric of neighborhoods with intra-urban freeways that encouraged people to abandon central cities in favor of suburban living was all the rage. Manhattan was spared, but the Outer Boroughs were not, and most American cities are deeply scarred by freeway projects from this era. Meanwhile, the anti-development attitudes that served Lower Manhattan well in fighting the freeway were later put to use blocking new privately financed housing developments, contributing to an ever-growing crisis of housing scarcity.</p> \n</div> \n<div class=""feature-photos-share-tools"">\n<a class=""feature-photos-share-tool twitter"" data-source=""feature-list-item"" data-social=""Twitter"" href=""javascript:void(0);""></a> <a class=""feature-photos-share-tool facebook"" data-source=""feature-list-item"" data-social=""Facebook"" href=""javascript:void(0);""></a>\n</div> \n</li> \n<li id=""list-item-15"" class=""list-15 clearfix feature-photos-list-item""> \n<div class=""feature-photos-photo feature-photos-column"">\n<a href=""https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2506972/Screen-Shot-2013-08-05-at-11.40.25-AM.0.jpg"" target=""_black""><img class=""lazy zoom"" data-src=""https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2506972/Screen-Shot-2013-08-05-at-11.40.25-AM.0.jpg""></a> <a href=""https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2506972/Screen-Shot-2013-08-05-at-11.40.25-AM.0.jpg"" target=""_blank"" class=""icon-link-ext-alt""></a> \n<p class=""feature-photos-caption""><a href=""http://books.google.com/books?id=FSkDAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;pg=PA47#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true"">Popular Science</a></p> \n</div> \n<div class=""feature-photos-story feature-photos-column""> \n<h4>Drain the East River</h4> \n<p>The invention of the automobile brought about the brand-new problem of traffic jams, and in 1924 Popular Science Monthly proposed one daring solution to New York City's woes — drain the east river. While a modern day dreamer might scheme of replacing the riverbed with affordable housing, the Jazz Age idea was to create what we'd nowadays recognize as an enormous freeway to sit between Manhattan and Brooklyn/Queens. City Hall and other monumental buildings could go in decked-over segments of the riverbed, but mostly it would be dedicated to automobile traffic. The plan, authored by John Harriss, a then-NYPD official charged with automobile traffic, called for the construction of two dams. One up by Hell's Gate would prevent water from the Hudson from flowing into the East River basin. The other, near where the Manhattan Bridge stands, would seal the riverbed at the other end.</p> \n</div> \n<div class=""feature-photos-share-tools"">\n<a class=""feature-photos-share-tool twitter"" data-source=""feature-list-item"" data-social=""Twitter"" href=""javascript:void(0);""></a> <a class=""feature-photos-share-tool facebook"" data-source=""feature-list-item"" data-social=""Facebook"" href=""javascript:void(0);""></a>\n</div> \n</li> \n<li id=""list-item-16"" class=""list-16 clearfix feature-photos-list-item""> \n<div class=""feature-photos-photo feature-photos-column"">\n<a href=""https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2507698/All_proposed_routes.0.PNG"" target=""_black""><img class=""lazy zoom"" data-src=""https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2507698/All_proposed_routes.0.PNG""></a> <a href=""https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2507698/All_proposed_routes.0.PNG"" target=""_blank"" class=""icon-link-ext-alt""></a> \n<p class=""feature-photos-caption""><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qattara_Depression_Project#mediaviewer/File:All_proposed_routes.PNG"">Always Unite</a></p> \n</div> \n<div class=""feature-photos-story feature-photos-column""> \n<h4>Qattara Project</h4> \n<p>The Qattara Depression, in Egypt, is a swathe of land about the size of Lake Ontario that sits near the Mediterrannean Sea, at an average depth of 200 meters below sea level. The Qattara Project was the brain child of a German hydrolic engineer named Friedrich Bassler who proposed digging a canal from the Mediterannean to flood the area. After about ten years, the water inside the depression would reach sea level. But the desert climate in the area would cause it to evaporate relatively rapidly, leading to a further influx of seawater. This ongoing flow was to be used to generate hydroelectricity. At the same time, the new, massive saline lake could transform a largely uninhabited desert area into a series of viable fishing communities. The part of the project where you dig a massive canal never penciled out as remotely cost-effective, but for some time the CIA maintained an interest in the project as part of its Cold War efforts to pull Egypt out of the Soviet orbit.</p> \n</div> \n<div class=""feature-photos-share-tools"">\n<a class=""feature-photos-share-tool twitter"" data-source=""feature-list-item"" data-social=""Twitter"" href=""javascript:void(0);""></a> <a class=""feature-photos-share-tool facebook"" data-source=""feature-list-item"" data-social=""Facebook"" href=""javascript:void(0);""></a>\n</div> \n</li> \n<li id=""list-item-17"" class=""list-17 clearfix feature-photos-list-item""> \n<div class=""feature-photos-photo feature-photos-column"">\n<a href=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2507756/ComparisonGCNA-NAWAPA1.0.gif"" target=""_black""><img class=""lazy zoom"" data-src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2507756/ComparisonGCNA-NAWAPA1.0.gif""></a> <a href=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2507756/ComparisonGCNA-NAWAPA1.0.gif"" target=""_blank"" class=""icon-link-ext-alt""></a> \n<p class=""feature-photos-caption""><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_Water_and_Power_Alliance#mediaviewer/File:ComparisonGCNA-NAWAPA1.gif"">Thomas Kierens</a></p> \n</div> \n<div class=""feature-photos-story feature-photos-column""> \n<h4>North American Water and Power Alliance</h4> \n<p>Alaska is too cold to be of much use to farmers, and much of America's warm, sunny landscape is on the dry side.

To be clear, though Sörgel thought of this as an alternative to military conflict among European states, the Atlantropa scheme was still massively racist and involved the idea that substantially draining the Mediterannean would facilitate European colonial domination of Africa. The basic plan called for the construction of a massive hydroelectric dam at the Straights of Gibraltar that would provide Europe with a huge supply of clean electricity. The dam — in conjunction with subsidiary dams near Sicily and Turkey — would also be used to lower the level of the sea. This would expose substantial new swathes of new land available for agriculture and human settlement. The plan also called for an extension of the Suez Canal to keep the lines of commerce open. Rather touchingly, Sörgel also had a soft spot for Venice's scenic qualities and wanted a special canal to be built to keep the city watery even as the bulk of the Adriatic dried up.</p> \n</div> \n<div class=""feature-photos-share-tools"">\n<a class=""feature-photos-share-tool twitter"" data-source=""feature-list-item"" data-social=""Twitter"" href=""javascript:void(0);""></a> <a class=""feature-photos-share-tool facebook"" data-source=""feature-list-item"" data-social=""Facebook"" href=""javascript:void(0);""></a>\n</div> \n</li> \n<hr> \n<h3>Proposed Countries</h3> \n<li id=""list-item-20"" class=""list-20 clearfix feature-photos-list-item""> \n<div class=""feature-photos-photo feature-photos-column"">\n<a href=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2507688/Screen_Shot_2014-12-01_at_1.47.04_PM.0.png"" target=""_black""><img class=""lazy zoom"" data-src=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2507688/Screen_Shot_2014-12-01_at_1.47.04_PM.0.png""></a> <a href=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2507688/Screen_Shot_2014-12-01_at_1.47.04_PM.0.png"" target=""_blank"" class=""icon-link-ext-alt""></a> \n<p class=""feature-photos-caption""><a href=""http://www.passia.org/palestine_facts/MAPS/1947-un-partition-plan-reso.html"">PASSIA</a></p> \n</div> \n<div class=""feature-photos-story feature-photos-column""> \n<h4>The partition of Palestine</h4> \n<p>A 1947 commission appointed by the United Nations drew this map to create a pathway for the end of British mandate rule over Palestine, and its replacement by two independent states, one Jewish and one Arab, as well as a special international zone around Jerusalem. Land was split about fifty-fifty even though Arabs outnumbered Jews by about 2:1 in the area. The map attempted to simultaneously respect existing settlement patterns, create room for a foreseen influx of new Jewish refugees from Europe, and also respect religious sensibilities regarding the Jerusalem area. The resulting plan would have created two very unusual states, with the Arab population divided into three barely-touching sectors plus an exclave around Jaffa. Israel, too, would have been divided in three, though with its population concentrated in the coastal plain. Jerusalem and Bethlehem, meanwhile, were to have constituted a ""corpus separatum"" under international administration. Jewish leaders accepted the plan, as did most UN member states. Arab states rejected it. Israel declared independence and in the ensuing war with its Arab neighbors captures considerably more land than it would have been allocated under the UN scheme.</p> \n</div> \n<div class=""feature-photos-share-tools"">\n<a class=""feature-photos-share-tool twitter"" data-source=""feature-list-item"" data-social=""Twitter"" href=""javascript:void(0);""></a> <a class=""feature-photos-share-tool facebook"" data-source=""feature-list-item"" data-social=""Facebook"" href=""javascript:void(0);""></a>\n</div> \n</li> \n<li id=""list-item-21"" class=""list-21 clearfix feature-photos-list-item""> \n<div class=""feature-photos-photo feature-photos-column"">\n<a href=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2529240/AsambleaXIII.svg.0.png"" target=""_black""><img class=""lazy zoom"" data-src=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2529240/AsambleaXIII.svg.0.png""></a> <a href=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2529240/AsambleaXIII.svg.0.png"" target=""_blank"" class=""icon-link-ext-alt""></a> \n<p class=""feature-photos-caption""><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Provinces_of_the_R%C3%ADo_de_la_Plata#mediaviewer/File:AsambleaXIII.svg"">Berkut</a></p> \n</div> \n<div class=""feature-photos-story feature-photos-column""> \n<h4>The United Provinces of South America</h4> \n<p>As Spanish rule over Latin America became unviable after Napoleon's conquest of the Spanish Empire's European homeland, it was by no means clear what shape the successor entities in the Western Hemisphere would take. Toward the southern end of Spanish America, one early proposed state was the United Provinces of South America, also known as the United Provinces of Rio de la Plata, maked here in blue. Politically speaking, this entity was centered on the port of Buenos Aires, just like modern-day Argentina. But it did not include much of the then-unsettled Pampas region, and extended north and west into a considerable portion of what's nowadays Bolivia. The proponents of the United Provinces also claimed modern-day Uruguay as well as territory that's currently in the hands of Brazil. The authorities in Buenos Aires were never able to effectively control the territory they claimed and the proto-state was wracked by constant civil war as well as conflict with Brazil.

PhD student Rachel Strohm argues it's an interesting window into the question of <a href=""http://rachelstrohm.com/2013/07/29/the-colonization-counterfactual/"">what Africa might look like</a> had it not been colonized by western powers. Real world African political boundaries tend to follow neither an ethnic logic nor to trace natural features of the geography. Instead you have a patchwork of European claims plus a series of diplomatic compromises between European powers who had no particular concern for the lives of the people whose fate they were deciding. Cyon's version of Africa has more states — reflecting the continent's considerable diversity — and many fewer straight lines as national boundaries. It's also ""upside down"" with south over north, in a play on the ways in which European military power ended up shaping our perceptions of the world.

But the tradition arises from a constitutional provision directing the executive branch to provide Congress with an annual update on how things are going. So, in that spirit, here's a series of 33 data visualizations that illustrate where America is in early 2015 and where it's going — with a special eye to the likely political flashpoints in the year to come.</p> \n<div class=""feature-photos"">\n<ol class=""feature-photos-list""> \n<li class=""list-0 clearfix feature-photos-list-item"" id=""list-item-0""> \n<div class=""feature-photos-photo feature-photos-column"">\n<a target=""_black"" href=""http://www.bls.gov/data/#maps""><img data-src=""https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2919556/Screen_Shot_2015-01-09_at_11.53.03_AM.0.png"" class=""lazy zoom""></a> <a class=""icon-link-ext-alt"" target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.bls.gov/data/#maps""></a> \n<p class=""feature-photos-caption""><a href=""http://www.bls.gov/data/#maps""> </a><a href=""http://www.bls.gov/data/#maps"">Bureau of Labor Statistics</a></p> \n</div> \n<div class=""feature-photos-story feature-photos-column""> \n<h4>The United States of unemployment</h4> \n<p>Our union is a large and diverse territory, and its economic fortunes differ substantially from place to place.

But a range of other states in the largely rural northern midsection of the country have unemployment rates that are well below average. These seem to be states that people are moderately reluctant to move to, even when economics suggests that moving could be a good way to find work.

The Census Bureau tracks this by measuring the United States' ""mean center of population"" — that is, ""the place where an imaginary, flat, weightless and rigid map of the United States would balance perfectly,"" if all Americans weighed exactly the same. From 1790 to 1940 or so, it marched steadily westward, at which point the invention of air conditioning started to lend a southward skew to the line. With population growth slowing down in California and speeding up in the Carolinas and Georgia, the future will likely involve an even sharper turn in the southern direction.</p> \n</div> \n<div class=""feature-photos-share-tools"">\n<a href=""javascript:void(0);"" data-social=""Twitter"" data-source=""feature-list-item"" class=""feature-photos-share-tool twitter""></a> <a href=""javascript:void(0);"" data-social=""Facebook"" data-source=""feature-list-item"" class=""feature-photos-share-tool facebook""></a>\n</div> \n</li> \n<li class=""list-3 clearfix feature-photos-list-item"" id=""list-item-3""> \n<div class=""feature-photos-photo feature-photos-column"">\n<a target=""_black"" href=""http://www.pewresearch.org/packages/political-polarization/""><img data-src=""http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/assets/4627051/Screen_Shot_2014-06-17_at_9.52.52_AM.png"" class=""lazy zoom""></a> <a class=""icon-link-ext-alt"" target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.pewresearch.org/packages/political-polarization/""></a> \n<p class=""feature-photos-caption""><a href=""http://www.pewresearch.org/packages/political-polarization/""> </a><a href=""http://www.pewresearch.org/packages/political-polarization/"">Pew Research Center</a></p> \n</div> \n<div class=""feature-photos-story feature-photos-column""> \n<h4>A polarized nation</h4> \n<p>There are many ways to define political polarization, but this chart from the Pew Research Center captures an important way in which the United States has become more divided on the issues. It's not the depths of our disagreements have become deeper — it's the fact that they've become better organized. Democrats now tend to be consistently liberal across a range of issues, while Republicans are consistently conservative. The mass public still isn't nearly as ideological as the average political pundit, but it is becoming more and more ideological and more systematic in how it thinks about issues.

Experts broadly agree that while building the pipeline would create some construction jobs and increase the profitability of some Canadian oil extraction operations, it wouldn't have a massive impact on the US economy or global climate change. Nonetheless, the fact that the pipeline crosses an international boundary means it requires approval by the US executive branch. That made it a convenient target for climate activists who wanted to draw a line in the sand against new fossil fuel projects.

A few of these states are places that had been growing at rapid rates and attracting workers from elsewhere; thus, though the slowdown will be noticeable, it shouldn't dent the national economy's momentum.

The other is that Casselman's chart counts the absolute number of jobs, while the earlier chart was indexed to the levels that existed at the start of the recession. Combine those two changes and you get a very different picture. They are both, however, saying the same thing: an enormous number of full-time jobs vanished during the recession, and an almost equally large number have been created since it ended.

But what it shows is that after shooting upward during the recession, the number of Americans who say they are involuntarily part-time due to an inability to find full time work (the blue line) has been trending steadily downward. By contrast, the number of people who say they are voluntarily working part-time has been trending upward. If you want to tie this to politics, you can say that Obama's redistributive policies are making people lazy and reducing the inclination to work. A more plausible explanation is probably that America's growing population of older people are increasingly opting for semi-retirement rather than fully leaving the workforce.</p> \n</div> \n<div class=""feature-photos-share-tools"">\n<a href=""javascript:void(0);"" data-social=""Twitter"" data-source=""feature-list-item"" class=""feature-photos-share-tool twitter""></a> <a href=""javascript:void(0);"" data-social=""Facebook"" data-source=""feature-list-item"" class=""feature-photos-share-tool facebook""></a>\n</div> \n</li> \n<div class=""chorus-snippet m-fishtank no-responsive-video""> \n<div data-ad-slot=""athena_features""></div> \n</div> \n<li class=""list-12 clearfix feature-photos-list-item"" id=""list-item-12""> \n<div class=""feature-photos-photo feature-photos-column"">\n<a target=""_black"" href=""http://www.bls.gov/web/metro/mmartcr1.gif""><img data-src=""https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2923740/Screen_Shot_2015-01-11_at_1.42.39_PM.0.png"" class=""lazy zoom""></a> <a class=""icon-link-ext-alt"" target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.bls.gov/web/metro/mmartcr1.gif""></a> \n<p class=""feature-photos-caption""><a href=""http://www.bls.gov/web/metro/mmartcr1.gif""> </a><a href=""http://www.bls.gov/web/metro/mmartcr1.gif"">Bureau of Labor Statistics</a></p> \n</div> \n<div class=""feature-photos-story feature-photos-column""> \n<h4>The best cities to find a job</h4> \n<p>This map from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics divides American metropolitan areas into those with unemployment rates below the national average and those with above-average levels of unemployment.

Republican politicians around the country turned out to be averse to establishing state exchanges, so federally run ones have ended up playing a much larger role in the system than was originally thought. That's why the <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/11/7/7148215/obamacare-supreme-court-subsidies-king"">King v.

Medicaid is normally financed jointly by state and federal governments, but the terms offered by the ACA are extremely generous — essentially 100 percent of the incremental costs of expansion are picked up by the feds, while money to help hospitals out with unreimbursed care for the indigent is taken away. (The match drops to 90 percent, gradually, by 2017). Doctors, hospitals, and other health care providers are eager to get this money, which is one reason that governors have often been eager to embrace it.

It seems clear enough, though, that the law really is achieving its basic goal of drastically shrinking the uninsurance rate.

This chart from Health Affairs shows that overall spending growth has slowed despite an increase in the overall use of health care services. In other words, more people are able to get health care, but that hasn't caused the price of health care services to explode. On the contrary, price growth has slowed down.

This chart from the Tax Foundation attempts to give some rigor to that idea by using Bureau of Economic Analysis data on metro area price levels to show how far $100 can stretch in each county in the United States. There are a few different factors that drive prices. One is that very remote rural areas (see Maine, or even more so, Alaska) tend to have higher prices than rural areas that are more connected to the rest of the country. That reflects the logistical hassles of importing various goods. The other factor is that urban areas are systematically more expensive than rural ones. But there's also huge variation between urban areas. The Boston-Washington corridor and the California coastline are much pricier than the cities of the South and Midwest. That's overwhelmingly a question of housing costs. The size and geography of the big coastal cities has become unfriendly to further sprawl, while zoning restrictions in inner cities and central suburbs prevent new construction from keeping prices in check.</p> \n</div> \n<div class=""feature-photos-share-tools"">\n<a href=""javascript:void(0);"" data-social=""Twitter"" data-source=""feature-list-item"" class=""feature-photos-share-tool twitter""></a> <a href=""javascript:void(0);"" data-social=""Facebook"" data-source=""feature-list-item"" class=""feature-photos-share-tool facebook""></a>\n</div> \n</li> \n<li class=""list-20 clearfix feature-photos-list-item"" id=""list-item-20""> \n<div class=""feature-photos-photo feature-photos-column"">\n<a target=""_black"" href=""http://factfinder2.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=ACS_12_1YR_DP03&amp;prodType=table""><img data-src=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2924090/MSAs_medianhouseholdincomemap.0.0.jpg"" class=""lazy zoom""></a> <a class=""icon-link-ext-alt"" target=""_blank"" href=""http://factfinder2.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=ACS_12_1YR_DP03&amp;prodType=table""></a> \n<p class=""feature-photos-caption""><a href=""http://factfinder2.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=ACS_12_1YR_DP03&amp;prodType=table""> </a><a href=""http://factfinder2.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=ACS_12_1YR_DP03&amp;prodType=table"">Census Bureau</a></p> \n</div> \n<div class=""feature-photos-story feature-photos-column""> \n<h4>High-wage cities</h4> \n<p>Incomes vary drastically from place to place across the United States. Large, relatively dense cities are generally home to high value-added industries that export goods across the country and around the world. Even for people who work in locally oriented markets, the ability to provide services — haircuts, restaurant meals, child care, medical care, education — to wealthy professionals raises incomes in these cities. Last but by no means least, workers are generally more productive in dense areas. Unfortunately, this map of economic opportunity looks pretty similar to the map of affordability above. Many Americans, in other words, could get a raise by moving to San Francisco or Boston, but they couldn't afford to live there. Austin and Minneapolis stand out as metro areas that have median incomes that are high relative to their housing costs.</p> \n</div> \n<div class=""feature-photos-share-tools"">\n<a href=""javascript:void(0);"" data-social=""Twitter"" data-source=""feature-list-item"" class=""feature-photos-share-tool twitter""></a> <a href=""javascript:void(0);"" data-social=""Facebook"" data-source=""feature-list-item"" class=""feature-photos-share-tool facebook""></a>\n</div> \n</li> \n<li class=""list-21 clearfix feature-photos-list-item"" id=""list-item-21""> \n<div class=""feature-photos-photo feature-photos-column"">\n<a target=""_black"" href=""http://www.equality-of-opportunity.org/""><img data-src=""https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2924112/Screen_Shot_2015-01-11_at_6.09.28_PM.0.png"" class=""lazy zoom""></a> <a class=""icon-link-ext-alt"" target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.equality-of-opportunity.org/""></a> \n<p class=""feature-photos-caption""><a href=""http://www.equality-of-opportunity.org/""> </a><a href=""http://www.equality-of-opportunity.org/"">Equality of Opportunity Project</a></p> \n</div> \n<div class=""feature-photos-story feature-photos-column""> \n<h4>Where the poor can rise</h4> \n<p>Raj Chetty and his collaborators at the Equality of Opportunity Project made waves when they constructed this map showing the average percentile rank of children who grow up in below-median income families across areas of the United States.

In the dark-shaded areas with low numbers, things are different — children who are born poor end up as poor adults who have poor children, with families stuck in multigenerational cycles of poverty. The geographical divide here is stark, and in some ways surprising. Broadly speaking, the South is a land of low mobility but Texas and Oklahoma are not.

When you add in the impact of international migration, things look quite a bit different for California, and somewhat different for Illinois, New York, and New Jersey, but there's an even stronger trend for people to move to Texas and Florida.

Using detailed financial data from the Luxembourg Income Study, Matt Bruenig shows where material living standards are higher than in the United States for people at different points on the income distribution. The median (i.e., 50th percentile) American is tied with the median Canadian to be the best-off median person in the world. But for the poorest ten percent of the population, life is better in 14 other countries. The United States is nearly the richest country on Earth on a per capita basis, but our material resources are distributed less equally than those in other English-speaking countries and much less equally than those of northern European countries. Consequently, while American living standards for people in the top half of the income distribution (i.e., the kind of people who run the political system and the media) are basically the best in the world, those for people in the bottom third are not so impressive.</p> \n</div> \n<div class=""feature-photos-share-tools"">\n<a href=""javascript:void(0);"" data-social=""Twitter"" data-source=""feature-list-item"" class=""feature-photos-share-tool twitter""></a> <a href=""javascript:void(0);"" data-social=""Facebook"" data-source=""feature-list-item"" class=""feature-photos-share-tool facebook""></a>\n</div> \n</li> \n<li class=""list-27 clearfix feature-photos-list-item"" id=""list-item-27""> \n<div class=""feature-photos-photo feature-photos-column"">\n<a target=""_black"" href=""https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2925526/MinimumWage-01.0.0.png""><img data-src=""https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2925526/MinimumWage-01.0.0.png"" class=""lazy zoom""></a> <a class=""icon-link-ext-alt"" target=""_blank"" href=""https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2925526/MinimumWage-01.0.0.png""></a> \n<p class=""feature-photos-caption"">Vox</p> \n</div> \n<div class=""feature-photos-story feature-photos-column""> \n<h4>The rising minimum wage</h4> \n<p>Even as Republicans swept to victory in the 2014 midterms, liberals consoled themselves with four winning ballot initiatives to raise state minimum wages.

As this chart shows, that's really not the case. Households earning less than $10,000 a year are genuinely rare. But above that level, the income distribution is more like a pyramid where the poorest cohorts have the most members and 75 percent of the population earns less than $85,000 a year. One thing to keep in mind, however, is that the real-world meaning of these different income levels varies quite a bit by circumstances. It's one thing to earn $35,000 right out of college, another thing entirely to earn $35,000 while supporting children, and yet another thing to be a retiree earning $35,000 in investment income off previous savings.</p> \n</div> \n<div class=""feature-photos-share-tools"">\n<a href=""javascript:void(0);"" data-social=""Twitter"" data-source=""feature-list-item"" class=""feature-photos-share-tool twitter""></a> <a href=""javascript:void(0);"" data-social=""Facebook"" data-source=""feature-list-item"" class=""feature-photos-share-tool facebook""></a>\n</div> \n</li> \n<hr> \n<h3>Education</h3> \n<li class=""list-30 clearfix feature-photos-list-item"" id=""list-item-30""> \n<div class=""feature-photos-photo feature-photos-column"">\n<a target=""_black"" href=""http://www.corestandards.org/standards-in-your-state/""><img data-src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2925702/Screen_Shot_2015-01-12_at_12.13.04_PM.0.png"" class=""lazy zoom""></a> <a class=""icon-link-ext-alt"" target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.corestandards.org/standards-in-your-state/""></a> \n<p class=""feature-photos-caption""><a href=""http://www.corestandards.org/standards-in-your-state/""> </a><a href=""http://www.corestandards.org/standards-in-your-state/"">CoreStandards.org</a></p> \n</div> \n<div class=""feature-photos-story feature-photos-column""> \n<h4>The Common Core debate</h4> \n<p>Once upon a time, the <a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/commoncore/what-is-the-common-core#E5389127"">Common Core</a> was a nice, friendly, bipartisan issue supported by Democrats (Barack Obama!) and Republicans (Jeb Bush!) alike, with buy-in from teacher's unions and major business groups. But American politics more and more operates as an engine of polarization rather than consensus-building, and the Common Core's identification with the Obama administration has led to its increasing abandonment by actors on the right. This map of which states have and haven't gotten on the bandwagon illustrates that tension. Most states, including some deeply conservative ones, have adopted the Common Core. But uptake isn't universal, and, with the exception of Minnesota, it's basically the conservative states that aren't in compliance.</p> \n</div> \n<div class=""feature-photos-share-tools"">\n<a href=""javascript:void(0);"" data-social=""Twitter"" data-source=""feature-list-item"" class=""feature-photos-share-tool twitter""></a> <a href=""javascript:void(0);"" data-social=""Facebook"" data-source=""feature-list-item"" class=""feature-photos-share-tool facebook""></a>\n</div> \n</li> \n<li class=""list-31 clearfix feature-photos-list-item"" id=""list-item-31""> \n<div class=""feature-photos-photo feature-photos-column"">\n<a target=""_black"" href=""http://www.ncsl.org/research/education/race-to-the-top.aspx""><img data-src=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2929034/racetothetop.0.gif"" class=""lazy zoom""></a> <a class=""icon-link-ext-alt"" target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.ncsl.org/research/education/race-to-the-top.aspx""></a> \n<p class=""feature-photos-caption""><a href=""http://www.ncsl.org/research/education/race-to-the-top.aspx""> </a><a href=""http://www.ncsl.org/research/education/race-to-the-top.aspx"">National Council of State Legislatures</a></p> \n</div> \n<div class=""feature-photos-story feature-photos-column""> \n<h4>Racing to the top</h4> \n<p>The Obama administration's Race To The Top initiative never became a focus of national politics because it was folded into the 2009 stimulus rather than debated on its own terms.

The federal government has a pretty narrow role in primary and secondary education, but Obama made money available to states — at a time when state governments were badly strapped — that aligned their laws and practices with the administration's preferences. The option to simply say no and change nothing existed, but the vast majority of states decided that they wanted to try to get their hands on some funds and shifted their policies accordingly.</p> \n</div> \n<div class=""feature-photos-share-tools"">\n<a href=""javascript:void(0);"" data-social=""Twitter"" data-source=""feature-list-item"" class=""feature-photos-share-tool twitter""></a> <a href=""javascript:void(0);"" data-social=""Facebook"" data-source=""feature-list-item"" class=""feature-photos-share-tool facebook""></a>\n</div> \n</li> \n<div class=""chorus-snippet m-fishtank no-responsive-video""> \n<div data-ad-slot=""athena_features""></div> \n</div> \n<li class=""list-32 clearfix feature-photos-list-item"" id=""list-item-32""> \n<div class=""feature-photos-photo feature-photos-column"">\n<a target=""_black"" href=""http://www.census.gov/acs/www/Downloads/data_documentation/2009_acs_maps/pctBachelorDegreeACS.pdf""><img data-src=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2929110/Screen_Shot_2015-01-13_at_11.15.02_AM.0.png"" class=""lazy zoom""></a> <a class=""icon-link-ext-alt"" target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.census.gov/acs/www/Downloads/data_documentation/2009_acs_maps/pctBachelorDegreeACS.pdf""></a> \n<p class=""feature-photos-caption""><a href=""http://www.census.gov/acs/www/Downloads/data_documentation/2009_acs_maps/pctBachelorDegreeACS.pdf""> </a><a href=""http://www.census.gov/acs/www/Downloads/data_documentation/2009_acs_maps/pctBachelorDegreeACS.pdf"">US Census Bureau</a></p> \n</div> \n<div class=""feature-photos-story feature-photos-column""> \n<h4>Where the college graduates are</h4> \n<p>This map, using American Community Survey data to track high county-level concentrations of college graduates, explains a lot about the United States.

That means a small increase in the black share of the population, paired with fairly rapid increases in the Latino and Asian population shares. This is often cast as indicating that the United States will soon be a ""majority-minority"" country, like California and Hawaii are today. On the other hand, the ways in which race is socially constructed have evolved in the past and will likely evolve again. Conceptions of whiteness have broadened and expanded over time to become more inclusive of people of Irish, Italian, and Jewish ancestry. It is plausible — especially given relatively high intermarriage rates — that many people who are presently considered Asian or Latino will be considered white by 2050.</p> \n</div> \n<div class=""feature-photos-share-tools"">\n<a href=""javascript:void(0);"" data-social=""Twitter"" data-source=""feature-list-item"" class=""feature-photos-share-tool twitter""></a> <a href=""javascript:void(0);"" data-social=""Facebook"" data-source=""feature-list-item"" class=""feature-photos-share-tool facebook""></a>\n</div> \n</li> \n<li class=""list-35 clearfix feature-photos-list-item"" id=""list-item-35""> \n<div class=""feature-photos-photo feature-photos-column"">\n<a target=""_black"" href=""https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2912906/border_patrol_gif.0.gif""><img data-src=""https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2912906/border_patrol_gif.0.gif"" class=""lazy zoom""></a> <a class=""icon-link-ext-alt"" target=""_blank"" href=""https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2912906/border_patrol_gif.0.gif""></a> \n<p class=""feature-photos-caption"">Joss Fong / Vox</p> \n</div> \n<div class=""feature-photos-story feature-photos-column""> \n<h4>The rise of border enforcement</h4> \n<p>Given the attention paid to unauthorized migration across the US-Mexico border, people often assume there was some ""old days"" in which the border was ""under control.""

Traditionally, the southern border was relatively unpoliced (much like the border with Canada is today) and people crossed back and forth without much difficulty. Increased border enforcement has made border crossing more of a permanent commitment, which has raised the stakes on the American side and fueled more investment in enforcement.

11 questions you werenâ€™t too embarrassed to ask Vox in our AMA,http://www.vox.com/2015/2/14/8031135/reddit-ama-answers,You asked. We answered.,"<p>Vox Editor-in-Chief <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://twitter.com/ezraklein"">Ezra Klein</a> and Executive Editor <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://twitter.com/mattyglesias"">Matt Yglesias</a> did a <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2vones/we_are_ezra_klein_and_matt_yglesias_ama_aua/"">Reddit AMA</a> on Thursday, discussing everything from clickbait to Obama with the citizens of the internet. Here's a roundup of some of the most interesting questions and answers.</p> \n<h3>1) Burritos</h3> \n<p><b>Question from Reddit user brheas: </b>Matt, what is your favorite kind of burrito?</p> \n<p><b>Matt: </b>I like the barbacoa from Chipotle.</p> \n<h3><span>2) Obama interview ground rules </span></h3> \n<p><span><b>two_off: </b></span>Were you briefed before your interview with the president about topics you are or aren't allowed to talk about?</p> \n<p><b>Ezra: </b>Nope. There were no ground rules in terms of what we could or couldn't ask about, and the WH had no knowledge of our questions.</p> \n<h3>3) Vox versus other sites</h3> \n<p><b>wonkinakilt</b>: Vox, FiveThirtyEight, and The Upshot all launched around the same time, and with at least superficial similarities. On that note: Do you think of them as your primary peers/competitors, more than traditional newspapers? What do you think you, FiveThirtyEight, and The Upshot each do particularly well, and what do you wish they (and you) did differently?</p> \n<p><b>Matt:</b> I think it's a little misleading to think of websites as primarily competing with other similar websites. At this point in history, any great online content that proves to audiences and advertisers the value of the web as a platform really just serves to grow the entire pie.</p> \n<h3>4) Clickbait</h3> \n<p><b>coolsnow7</b>: This might sound more like a complaint, so it should be read in the context of my fandom noted above: when you guys left WaPo and Slate respectively, I expected Vox to be the best thing ever: an endless stream of Moneybox posts and healthcare wonkiness and interviews with Paul Ryan that went deep into the details of his core beliefs and how they translated into his budget, etc. Instead, we've been getting clickbait Jon Stewart aggregation mixed with some clickbait ""political correctness"" chastisement. (I'm using the term the way Chait did.) My question is... what happened? Is this sellout going to last forever? Is it just to get the site up and running, or are the Vox Media overlords going to demand this sort of thing forever?</p> \n<p><b>Ezra:</b> I ran Wonkblog, and I can say, with perfect certainty, there is more and deeper policy coverage on Vox than we were able to do on Wonkblog. That's not because we did a bad job at Wonkblog or even because we're doing a better job at Vox. It's just that we have an immigration reporter, an education reporter, a second economy reporter, a drugs reporter, etc. There's just much more policy work. And there's way more of the policy work than there is of Stewart aggregation (or even of Stewart + John Oliver aggregation, and I don't say that lightly.)</p> \n<p><q class=""center"" aria-hidden=""true"">""any great online content that proves to audiences and advertisers the value of the web as a platform really just serves to grow the entire pie""</q></p> \n<p>But I hear complaints like yours occasionally, and I think there are a few reasons why.</p> \n<p>1) A lot of people experience Vox through what pops on social media, and John Oliver videos and controversial arguments about race and gender tend to pop on social media (though so do all kinds of things). So if your Vox experience is social media driven, it's biased towards what does well on social media, and it's easy to mistake that as somehow representative of the output. On Wonkblog, that stuff more or less didn't exist, so it never filled the channel.</p> \n<p>2) We haven't done much yet to differentiate sections of the site and make them easy to follow individually. You should be able to follow the culture side without having to pick through policy coverage. You should be able to follow our policy coverage without having to click past science coverage. Etc and so on. This is a major priority for us in the coming months. All that said, speaking as the guy who edits a lot of this stuff, there's honestly more econ and policy coverage than I am able to read in a day on Vox. One way to follow it more tightly, if you want to, is to bookmark our <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.vox.com/policy_and_politics"">Policy and Politics section</a>.</p> \n<h3>5) Wonky stories</h3> \n<p><b style=""font-weight: bold;"">TequilaMockingbird23</b>: What happened to getting in the weeds? Sure, the explainers are great, but what about technical pieces digging into the minutiae of the SGR or Disproportionate Share Hospital stuff? That kind of wonkiness didn't survive the move from WaPo</p> \n<p><b>Matt:</b> Perhaps I could interest you in the weedsy details of <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/1/6/7496271/fair-value-accounting"" target=""_blank"">Fair Value Accounting</a>.</p> \n<p><b>TequilaMockingbird23: </b>THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT SON!</p> \n<p><b>Ezra: </b><a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/7/28/5944967/the-big-health-wonk-news-in-todays-medicare-report"" target=""_blank"">Oh didn't it?</a></p> \n<h3>6) Obama's scent and comment kerfluffle</h3> \n<p><b>pnewell</b>: What does President Obama smell like? What's your take on the small kerfluffle about Obama's comments on media overhyping terrorism in regards to climate change?</p> \n<p><b>Matt:</b> He smells pretty normal. I wrote this <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/2/11/8019155/random-paris-deli"">whole thing</a> about my reaction to the gaffe kerfluffle. I found it pretty depressing.</p> \n<h3>7) Monetizing Vox</h3> \n<p><b>arlipman</b>: How will Vox monetize to stay viable? I cant believe that banner ads will cover the burn that is required to generate all of the content.</p> \n<p><b>Ezra:</b> Definitely agree that the future is not 100% banner ads. But that's different than saying that there isn't a good business around advertising/events. There are a lot of different ways to think about this, but the one I subscribe to is you ultimately need to be offering some kind of non-commoditized product to advertisers, as Google and Facebook are always going to win in the straight commoditized advertising game. That may be something about your audience, something about the kind of advertising you can create or can run, or some combination thereof.</p> \n<p><q class=""center"" aria-hidden=""true"">""WE TALK A LOT INTERNALLY ABOUT HAVING A PROCESS THAT IS OPENMINDED EVEN IF THE STORY COMES TO A CLEAR CONCLUSION""</q></p> \n<p>There are also other revenue streams, including events and subscriptions. All in, though, I'm really optimistic about the business model, and what I've seen over the last year has made me much more so, not less so. I think there's an enormous amount of pessimism around the journalism business but I think that has more to do with a changeover both in business models and cost structures.</p> \n<h3>8) Evergreen content</h3> \n<p><b>renano: </b>Matt, you recently talked about your efforts in refreshing and re-publicizing ""evergreen"" content. How's that project progressing? What were you most surprised by?</p> \n<p><b>Matt:</b> It's progressing quite nicely! We slowed down the pace of evergreen republishing since I wrote that <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/1/15/7546877/evergreen-experiment"">story</a>, but we're doing it on a continuous basis now and it keeps paying dividends.</p> \n<p>The most surprising thing about it, I guess, is how unsurprising it is. Everyone has always published evergreen pieces. Republishing select old ones really turns out not to change very much. It just lets you share those stories with more people.</p> \n<h3>9) Vox's political perspective</h3> \n<p><b style=""font-weight: bold;""> rgottley</b>: Hi Ezra and Matt, Thanks for doing this. I'm a big fan of y'all's work and really appreciated what y'all have done with Vox. I enjoyed Matt's work at Slate, and y'all made a great hire in Todd Van Der Werff, so it's been easy to follow those guys over to a new site. So first, thanks for what y'all do, and I look forward to what y'all will be doing with this site in the future.</p> \n<p>Since I follow Vox pretty closely I could have number of questions, but I'll stick to my biggest concern about the publication. Since you started last year, Vox has had an almost entirely unabashed liberal perspective. Matt's economic writing usually supports Democratic policies and opposes Republicans; the ""Obamacare implementation went great and people love it"" is a classic of the genre. Vox is also a pretty reliable home of liberal thought on identity politics, and Ezra's ""'Yes Means Yes' is a terrible law, and I completely support it"" sticks out here.</p> \n<p>I do generally agree with Vox's political perspective, and I'm as in favor of the old saw that ""reality has a well-known liberal bias"" as anyone. I also wouldn't necessarily hold a publication to a requirement for false objectivity - a publication has to make value judgments somewhere. But I think there is some truth to the claims of conservative critics that Vox isn't so much dedicated to analyzing the roots of public policy as advancing a partisan perspective. I feel this editorial direction could lead to a lot of confirmation of already-held beliefs, and as much as I appreciate my beliefs being confirmed, it could really limit Vox's wider appeal.</p> \n<p>So, how do you respond to criticisms of Vox's political perspective?</p> \n<p><b>Ezra:</b> So this is a serious issue, and one I think about a lot. We have some diversity of perspective at Vox - Tim Lee, for instance, is a libertarian who previously worked at Cato - but I take the point that in a lot of political controversies, our writers, at this moment and given this constellation of political forces, tend to end up somewhere on the center-left.</p> \n<p>Some of that is happenstance. There are a few job offers I've made to right-leaning writers that, for all the normal reasons, didn't pan out. I'll make more in the future. I don't have an ideological test for candidates.</p> \n<p><q class=""center"" aria-hidden=""true"">""I TRY TO HIRE JOURNALISTS WHO I THINK ARE KNOWLEDGEABLE ON THEIR TOPICS, RESPONSIBLE IN THEIR APPROACH AND VERY COMMITTED TO HELPING THEIR AUDIENCE."" </q></p> \n<p>Some of the issue here, I think, speaks to this moment in politics. The minority party - which is what the GOP has broadly been for the last six years - is often less responsible on policy than the governing party. The long-term assumptions in Paul Ryan's budget really did get ludicrous, for instance (look at discretionary spending), in a way that a budget that had to go through a Mitt Romney OMB probably wouldn't have. One problem for the GOP in recent years is that Obama has been willing to accept some of their positions (like deep spending cuts, or chained CPI, or even an individual mandate), but they have, for rational political reasons, not wanted to compromise with him, and it's just left them less ideological room in which to craft sound policies. I think that may change when they retake power.</p> \n<p>So I wonder if we were in a Mitt Romney administration whether Vox's politics would look different to folks. In a world where it's the Democratic Party that has to make messaging more than policy I think you'd see more stuff like <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/7/1/5860742/5-mistakes-liberals-make-about-corporate-personhood-and-hobby-lobby"" target=""_blank"">this</a> or <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/2/2/7963243/net-neutrality-bipartisan-compromise"" target=""_blank"">this</a>.</p> \n<p>But then there's a deeper issue here which is that the word ""explain"" does not carry some special power, just as the word ""report"" never did. I try to hire journalists who I think are knowledgeable on their topics, responsible in their approach, and very committed to helping their audience. But at the end of the day, they're just people. We talk a lot internally about having a process that is openminded even if the end story comes to a clear conclusion, and about being extremely generous to arguments you disagree with. We don't always succeed on these fronts, but we're trying, and trying hard every day.</p> \n<p>What I do think is important though is that we're transparent in both how we got to a conclusion and what that conclusion is. I'm much less comfortable reading something from a reporter who has a point of view but has hidden that point of view in the quotes of their sources and the structure of their story than a reporter who has a point of view and comes out and explains why they think it's the right one and lets you disagree.</p> \n<p><b>rgottley:</b><b> </b>Thanks for the considered, reasoned response. It's clear from this that political perspective is a high priority issue for you, and I'm glad you're taking it seriously. The distinction of Republicans making ""messaging more than policy"" is a good one, and one I hadn't really considered.</p> \n<h3>10) Articles on the US bombing ISIS ... and on shorts</h3> \n<p><b style=""font-weight: bold;"">hodgesmr</b>:<b style=""font-weight: bold;""> </b>How do you decide that you're going to publish both <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/8/7/5980595/iraq-crisis-bombing"">Why the US is bombing ISIS in Iraq</a> and <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/9/2/6094137/should-you-wear-shorts-in-public-today-a-flowchart-guide-for-the-men"">Should you wear shorts in public today?</a> and say you're 'explaining the news'? Only one of those seems to fit your mission.</p> \n<p><b>Matt:</b> Well, look, it's true that men face the question of shorts versus grownup pants on a daily basis while the ISIS situation has little practical impact on a normal person's life.

The real reasons Iran is so committed to its nuclearÂ program,http://www.vox.com/2015/2/25/8101383/iran-nuclear-reasons,"Why is Tehran so bent on a program that has brought devastating sanctions, isolation, and threats of war?","<p>As the deadlines near for Iran and world powers to reach an agreement on the country's nuclear program — the first, on March 31, for a basic political framework — negotiations are focusing on what kind of program Iran can have. How much uranium and plutonium can it have? How many centrifuges can it use to develop more fuel? How long will restrictions be in place?</p> \n<p>There's one fact, though, that is taken as assumed: Iran very badly wants a nuclear program. So badly that it has been willing to press ahead with the program, secretly as well as overtly, despite Western and UN sanctions that have crippled its economy, and despite repeated US warnings of possible military action.</p> \n<p>Iran claims its program is entirely peaceful, but there are major reasons to doubt this, and it is generally taken as a given by analysts that the country has at least taken just-in-case steps partway toward building a bomb. Some facilities seem to serve <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2013/11/12/a-nuclear-expert-explains-in-very-basic-language-the-science-at-the-heart-of-iranian-nuclear-talks/"">little plausible function</a> beyond nuclear weapons capability, though a point that Western intelligence agencies have made in the past is that building the capacity for making a bomb is not the same as deciding to make a bomb.</p> \n<p>Whatever Iran's intentions, though, the country's <span>dedication to nuclear enrichment even at such enormous costs can seem bizarrely counterproductive. So why is Iran so set on its nuclear program? There is no one dominant answer, but rather a few plausible explanations, some of which go against the most common Western perceptions and misperceptions of how Iran works. There is probably some truth to all of them.</span></p> \n<h3>1) Iran wants to defend against external threats it earnestly fears</h3> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3445468/GettyImages_103247707.0.jpg"" alt=""GettyImages_103247707.0.jpg"" data-chorus-asset-id=""3445468""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">An Iranian soldier on the front line of the war with Iraq in 1986 (Kaveh Kazemi/Getty)</p> \n<p>Consider Tehran's view for a moment: Israeli and American leaders have been talking for years about bombing Iran or invading it outright. The Bush administration named Iran part of its ""axis of evil,"" alongside Iraq, which it invaded months later. For much of the last decade, the US has had thousands of troops in Iraq and Afghanistan, both Iran's neighbors.</p> \n<p>Iranian leaders appear to sincerely believe that the United States is bent on their government's destruction. For example, the United States helped Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein in his brutal, years-long war against Iran, in which he killed thousands of Iranians, including with chemical weapons. It is difficult to overstate how traumatic the years-long war was for Iranians, how badly they want to prevent another such war. And nothing deters chemical weapon attacks like a nuclear weapon.</p> \n<p>You will hear Iranians frequently mention <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2013/10/16/the-forgotten-story-of-iran-air-flight-655/"">Iran Air flight 655</a>, a civilian airliner that the US military accidentally shot down in 1988, killing 290 civilians. In Iran, this is still frequently viewed as deliberate. Imagine you're an Iranian leader seeing all this. You might want a nuclear deterrent.</p> \n<p>Also consider the timing of the program. When the ayatollahs came to power in the 1979 Islamic revolution, they at first cancelled the country's nuclear program, but then re-started it after Saddam invaded in 1980.</p> \n<p>""Tehran wanted to guard against a future surprise analogous to Iraq's repeated use of chemical weapons,"" <a href=""http://iranprimer.usip.org/resource/politics-irans-nuclear-program"" target=""_blank"">writes Shahram Chubin</a> of the Carnegie Endowment. More recently, Iran has been embroiled in low-level proxy conflicts with Israel and Saudi Arabia, and with what it sees as a defensive conflict against the hostile West.</p> \n<p>It's important to remember that Iran sees itself as isolated in the world, despite intimations of occasional Russian or Chinese support. Save for proxies such as Hezbollah and the Syrian government, it sees the Middle East as largely aligned against it. It is also important to remember that its leaders, in power only since 1979, feel weak and isolated. Current Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei in particular has never been very confident in power.</p> \n<p>That sense of insecurity feeds into a rational desire for deterrence against external threats, but it also creates a less rational belief in anti-Iran conspiracies or an impending American invasion. When the US threatens to bomb Iran to <i>stop</i> a nuclear program, Iranian leaders can misread this as a desire to destroy the Iranian state itself, which would make them more likely to want a nuclear deterrent, which only makes the US threaten more strenuously.</p> \n<h3>2) Nuclear enrichment has symbolic importance for Iran</h3> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3445484/GettyImages_80725517.0.jpg"" alt=""GettyImages_80725517.0.jpg"" data-chorus-asset-id=""3445484""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">A military parade in Tehran in 2008 (Majid/Getty)</p> \n<p>Iran's national pride runs deep, and with good reason: It has been an active center of cultural, scientific, religious and political thought for many centuries. It's also still upset, again with reason, about decades of Western interference during the 19th and 20th centuries.</p> \n<p>The nuclear program is a way in which Iran affirms, to itself and to the world, that it is an advanced and sovereign nation. It's a way of saying: we are not inferior to the world powers, even though you treat us that way, but are in fact equals.</p> \n<p>It's also a way of defying what Iran sees as continued Western efforts to control, exploit or weaken Iran. The more that the world tells Iran it cannot have a nuclear program, the more important building such a program becomes for the cause of Iranian nationalism.</p> \n<p>This is part of why Iranian leaders so often state that they want world powers to affirm Iran's right to enrich uranium and to respect Iran's ""dignity"" — a word that top officials use frequently. This isn't posturing — they really mean it.</p> \n<p>In November 2013, as nuclear talks got underway, Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2013/11/19/five-lessons-from-the-iranian-foreign-ministers-video-asking-for-peace/"" target=""_blank"">released a video</a> articulating Iran's position. He spent very little time talking about actual nuclear policies — the meat and potatoes of the negotiations — and lots of time saying things like, ""We expect and demand respect for our dignity."" He frequently mentioned phrases such as ""equal footing"" and ""mutual respect."" The video was taken as bizarre and inexplicable by Americans, because they could not see that this demand for respect was not a side issue — it was central for Iran.</p> \n<h3><span>3) The nuclear program has become a big issue in Iranian domestic politics</span></h3> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3445500/GettyImages_458443250.0.jpg"" alt=""GettyImages_458443250.0.jpg"" data-chorus-asset-id=""3445500""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei speaks in Tehran in 2004 (BEHROUZ MEHRI/AFP/Getty)</p> \n<p>There was a brief moment, after the US invasions of Afghanistan in 2001 and Iraq in 2003 (both Iran's neighbors) where Tehran seemed eager to strike a deal with the West over its nuclear program. There are many reasons that fell apart — Dick Cheney <a href=""http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2012/01/how-the-us-and-iran-keep-failing-to-find-a-peace-they-both-want/251853/"" target=""_blank"">personally worked to torpedo</a> any communications, for example — but a crucial one was Iranian politics.</p> \n<p>Iran's anti-US hard-liners took the parliament in 2004, and the presidency in 2005 with the election of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. The hard-liners turned the nuclear program into something of a partisan wedge issue, using it to weaken reformers and moderates who wanted to compromise the program to soften relations with the West.</p> \n<p>""Both Ahmadinejad and Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei used the nuclear issue to stigmatize reformists, depicting them as defeatists willing to negotiate away Iran's interests,"" Chubin writes. ""Their use of the nuclear issue as an instrument of partisan politics ended the phase when the nuclear program was supposed to be a national issue. And debate was actively discouraged.""</p> \n<p>This was great politics for Ahmadinejad and other hard-liners. But it made it much more difficult for him or other Iranian leaders to compromise on the program. They were too invested in the program, politically, to back down — even if backing down would have been in Iran's national interests.</p> \n<p>""By 2010,"" Chubin writes, ""the divide over Iran's nuclear program had more to do with domestic politics-and very little to do with what many of the key players actually wanted to see happen.""</p> \n<p>Ahmadinejad is out of power, but the hard-liners are still powerful. They have particular influence over Khamenei, who as supreme leader is the ultimate decision-maker. Because of the way Khamenei came to power — his religious credentials are weak, and his political credibility never as strong as predecessor and national founder Ruhollah Khomeini — he's long caved to hard-liners, who he fears could turn against him.</p> \n<h3><span>4) Iran sees itself as in a struggle for influence in the region — a nuke would help a lot</span></h3> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3445506/GettyImages_463415800.0.jpg"" alt=""GettyImages_463415800.0.jpg"" data-chorus-asset-id=""3445506""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">A Lebanese boy carries a Lebanese flag past portraits of Iranian Supreme Leader Khamenei, former Supreme Leader and national founder Ruhollah Khomeini, and Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah (MAHMOUD ZAYYAT/AFP/Getty)</p> \n<p>Since Iran become the Islamic Republic in the 1979 revolution, it has seen the Middle East as a battleground for its influence. This is meant as both defensive and offensive; ever since Saddam invaded, Iranian leaders have feared that hostile, Western-backed Arab leaders could do them terrible harm. And Tehran sees pro-American Sunni powers such as Saudi Arabia as inherently hostile.</p> \n<p>But Iran is also expansive and aggressive in the region, supporting proxy terror groups such as Hamas and Hezbollah both as a deterrent against American or Israeli threats and as a way to project its power. In the context of this regional struggle for power, a nuclear weapon starts to make a lot more sense. Not as something that Tehran would want to actually use, but as a way to get away with other sorts of trouble-making.</p> \n<p><a style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.65;"" href=""http://trojan.troy.edu/globalcampus/pacific/faculty.html#sherrill"" target=""_blank"">Clifton W. Sherrill</a> of Troy University <a href=""http://cns.miis.edu/npr/pdfs/npr_19-1_sherrill_iran_bomb.pdf"" target=""_blank"">explained</a> in a 2012 issue of <a href=""http://cns.miis.edu/npr/19-1.htm"" target=""_blank"">Nonproliferation Review</a> how Iran could use a nuclear weapon as not just a deterrent but a way to give itself cover for bullying its neighbors and generally projecting more power in the region, where competition for influence is already high, and the stakes are enormous.</p> \n<p>""The regime believes nuclear weapons would deter foreign military strikes targeting the Iranian homeland, making the Iranian use of conventional military force abroad less risky,"" Sherrill writes. ""At a minimum, possession of nuclear arms would allow Iran greater policy flexibility in the Middle East.""</p> \n<p>That likely means using proxy groups, such as Hezbollah in Lebanon, even more aggressively to threaten and bully other countries in the region. That also means pushing harder to support pro-Iran militant groups in countries such as Syria and Yemen where Iran sees itself as competing for influence. The idea is that Iran can be more brazen and aggressive with these non-nuclear threats because its nuclear weapon would scare other countries out of retaliating.</p> \n<p>That bullying could also have implications for energy politics; Iran might feel it could force ""demands in the Persian Gulf regarding disputed islands or natural gas fields"" or ""desires regarding production quotas"" within OPEC, Sherrill warns. And he points to nuclear-armed Pakistan as an example of how this all can happen:</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>Pakistan's behavior after its public entry into the nuclear club in 1998 is instructive: it immediately increased support for Islamist militants, creating 1999's Kargil crisis and the standoff with India in 2000 and 2001. In a classic example of the stability-instability paradox, Pakistani confidence that nuclear arms would prevent escalation made limited conventional and terrorist attacks against India possible.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<h3>Iran does <i>not</i> want a bomb to launch an offensive strike against another country</h3> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3445558/GettyImages_103498474.0.jpg"" alt=""GettyImages_103498474.0.jpg"" data-chorus-asset-id=""3445558""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">An Iranian flag flies near a surface-to-surface missile in an undisclosed location (VAHID REZA ALAEI/AFP/Getty)</p> \n<p>Despite widespread misconceptions to the contrary in the US — often pushed by politicians who wish to play up the Iranian threat for political gain — there is no reason to believe that Iran wants to launch an offensive nuclear strike against the US, Israel, or any other country.</p> \n<p>The well-established logic of nukes would make any war against other nuclear powers a loser for Iran. This is because powers such as the US and Israel have what is called second-strike capability, meaning that even if Iran got off a nuclear strike, the country would still be destroyed by the retaliation. There is no cost-benefit calculation by which an offensive strike would make sense for Iran.</p> \n<p>As Sherrill explained, ""It is highly unlikely that the Islamist regime plans to actually detonate a nuclear weapon in an offensive attack. Both of the obvious targets, the United States and Israel, have a second-strike nuclear arsenal capable of threatening the Islamist regime's survival.""</p> \n<p>Some argue that Iran's leaders are inherently irrational because of their religion and would be willing to launch a suicidal war against the US or Israel. As Newt Gingrich once put it, for example, ""It's impossible to deter them. What are you going to threaten?""</p> \n<p><span>The seemingly sole piece of evidence that Iran's leaders have spent the last 36 years secretly plotting a suicidal war is the idea that their interpretation of Shia Islam foretells of a messiah who will return on the apocalypse. While Ahmadinejad did reference this idea many times, he was alone in this, as </span><a target=""_blank"" href=""http://foreignpolicy.com/2011/08/24/the-martyr-state-myth/"" style=""font-size: 1.15em; line-height: 1.65; background-color: #ffffff;"">Matt Duss of the Foundation for Middle East Peace explains</a><span>, and was widely rebuked by Shia scholars and his own country's political and clerical establishments.</span></p> \n<p>Actual readings of Iran's official Shia theology by actual religious scholars, Duss finds, reach the opposite conclusion that Newt Gingrich did: Iranian leaders see it as their religious duty to preserve their system, not destroy it in a fiery war with Israel. As scholar Mehdi Khalaji told Duss, ""As the theory of the guardianship of the jurist requires, the most significant task of the Supreme Leader is to safeguard the regime, even by overruling Islamic law.""</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, there is ample evidence that Iranian leaders are just as rationally invested in self-preservation as anyone else. You can't hold up a political system as complex and besieged as Iran's without being shrewdly self-interested. If Iran's Islamic regime were really looking for a suicidal war in which to martyr itself, the eight-year war with Iraq offered many such opportunities, none of which they took.</p> \n<p>There are a number of reasons that Iran wants a nuclear program and has taken steps toward a nuclear bomb. Some of those reasons are rational and others are not. But a desire to launch an offensive strike against another country is not one of them.</p>",Politics

(RICK WILKING/AFP/Getty)</p> \n<p><span>This letter is very significant for three big reasons:</span></p> \n<p><b>1) It's a deliberate effort to blow up the US-Iran nuclear talks.</b> One of the biggest problems in the negotiations is trust: how to get the US and Iran to overcome decades of antagonism and to trust one another to follow through on their respective ends of the bargain. Republicans in Congress, who largely oppose the talks, have been trying to blow up negotiations by imposing new sanctions on Iran (something US negotiators promised not to do during talks), thus destroying trust between the two countries and forcing Iran to walk away.</p> \n<p>This is the purpose of Cotton's letter: to convince Iran's leaders that Obama's promises could be undermined by Republicans, that the US cannot be trusted to uphold its end, and thus that Iran should quit the talks.</p> \n<p><b>2) This is an unprecedented breach in protocol — and maybe even the law. </b>Constitutional law sets sharp, and important, limits on Congress's involvement in foreign policy; unlike with legislation, the law defines<b> </b>the president as the ""sole organ"" in making foreign policy. Cotton's letter, by interfering with Obama's foreign policy, <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/3/9/8177815/republicans-foreign-policy-sabotage"" target=""_blank"">goes well beyond those limits and could very easily be seen as unconstitutional</a> (much like Republicans' recent invitation to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to speak to Congress against Obama's Iran talks).</p> \n<p>The letter<b> </b>also seems to potentially violate a law called the Logan Act, which forbids Americans from interfering in US foreign policy. The law was originally passed when a state legislator sent a letter to France, in 1798, undermining US policy toward France. Prosecution under the Logan Act isn't something that really happens, and Cotton will not be dragged before the Supreme Court. But this letter goes way beyond the legally articulated limits on Congress' role in foreign policy. It is not just undermining Obama's Iran talks, but the very foundations of how foreign policy is made in the United States.</p> \n<blockquote class=""twitter-tweet"" lang=""en""> \n<p>Between Bibi invite and Cotton letter, GOP are blazing new trails in politicization of foreign policy--and debasement of their institutions.</p> \n— David Rothkopf (@djrothkopf) <a href=""https://twitter.com/djrothkopf/status/575012361687400448"">March 9, 2015</a>\n</blockquote> \n<p><b>3) This could dramatically alter the politics of the Iran deal in Washington.</b> It's too soon to say precisely how the politics will play out here, but the implications could be far-reaching. By taking this extreme step, Cotton is almost certainly going to polarize the politics of the Iran deal and heighten the partisan nature of it. That could mean polarizing Republicans against the deal — he got dove-ish GOP Sen. Rand Paul to sign on, after all — but it could also mean polarizing Democrats in support of the deal.</p> \n<p>Either of those outcomes would be significant and could change the outcome of Obama's years-long effort to negotiate a nuclear deal with Iran. If Obama wants to get his Iran deal ratified as a formal treaty, he will need some Republican support in the Senate. Cotton's letter could help make sure that doesn't happen. At the same time, if Obama decides to just make the US end of the deal an executive agreement (this is common for international agreements), then all Obama will need is for Congress to avoid passing new sanctions; in other words, to do nothing. <span>Cotton's letter could help Obama in this case, by polarizing Democrats (some of whom had previously pushed for sanctions) such that they won't want to join Republicans in passing new sanctions.</span></p> \n<h3>What do Tom Cotton and the other Republican signatories want?</h3> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""2435424"" alt=""ali khamenei"" src=""https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2435424/Grand_Ayatollah_Ali_Khamenei_.0.jpg""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Ali Khamenei. (<a href=""http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/%D8%B9%D9%84%DB%8C_%D8%AE%D8%A7%D9%85%D9%86%D9%87%E2%80%8C%D8%A7%DB%8C#mediaviewer/File:Grand_Ayatollah_Ali_Khamenei,.jpg"" target=""_blank"">Sajed.ir</a>)</p> \n<p>Cotton and a number of other Congressional Republicans are earnestly opposed to any deal whatsoever between the US and Iran and worry that Obama's negotiations will put America at risk. Their view is that Iran's leaders are so fundamentally aggressive and untrustworthy that they are almost certainly negotiating in bad faith and will exploit any deal to further their nuclear program.</p> \n<p>Though many analysts find this argument <a sl-processed=""1"" href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2013/11/25/9-questions-about-irans-nuclear-program-you-were-too-embarrassed-to-ask/"">unpersuasive</a>, it is a valid position, and it's fair play to oppose the Iran deal on those grounds. But that opposition has grown to such an extent that Cotton has crossed a line from opposing an Iran deal to actively undermining not just the deal but US foreign policy itself.</p> \n<p>It is also important to note that, while Cotton and other Republicans say that they do not oppose <i>any</i> nuclear deal with Iran but rather just the terms of this deal, that is difficult to believe for two reasons. First, negotiations are still ongoing and a deal still taking shape, so it's odd for Republicans to insist that the terms are so atrocious that they have no choice but to blow up negotiations, when the terms are still forthcoming.</p> \n<p>Second, Cotton has actually been <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/03/09/tom-cotton-iran_n_6831328.html?1425916885"" target=""_blank"">quite clear in the past</a> that he <i>does</i> want talks to fail no matter the terms and believes that the only appropriate solution to Iran's nuclear program is outright regime change, which would almost certainly require war to achieve.</p> \n<p>The underlying idea that Cotton had expressed is one that is common in more hawkish, neoconservative worldviews: that the core problem driving Iran's nuclear program is the fundamental nature of the regime, that this fundamental nature makes it impossible for the US to ever trust Iran and thus the US should never engage in negotiations, and finally that the only solution to this deeper problem is to remove that regime by force. This view is <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/3/3/8135255/enemies-iran-russia"" target=""_blank"">politically unpopular</a>, though, as many Americans remember similar arguments leading up the disastrous 2003 Iraq invasion.</p> \n<h3>Is the letter working? Has it blown up Iran negotiations and/or rallied Congress against Obama?</h3> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""3323736"" alt=""biden pointer"" src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3323736/137678501.0.0.jpg""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Joe Biden pointing at some folks at the 2012 State of the Union, with House Speaker John Boehner. (Pool / Getty Images)</p> \n<p>It doesn't appear to have done either, but it will be difficult to tell for some time.</p> \n<p>Shortly after the letter was published, Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/3/9/8180933/zarif-cotton-letter"" target=""_blank"">published a response</a>, the text of which was noticeably passive aggressive and mocking. Zarif stated that he saw Cotton's letter as a ""propaganda ploy"" meant to undermine Obama and suggested that Iran would disregard its threats. In other words, Zarif was saying that Iran saw through the letter and would not let it impact the ongoing negotiations.</p> \n<p>But Zarif, a US-educated political moderate, does not represent the entirety of Iran's government. Iran's very unusual political system has an elected president (Hassan Rouhani, also a moderate who supports negotiations), but it also has an unelected supreme leader who is above the president. That supreme leader is Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, a hard-liner who has given the nuclear talks support but is also susceptible to pressure from more severe Iranian hard-liners who oppose talks. So it's possible that hard-liners, or even Khamenei himself, will not disregard the letter as Zarif did and that this could make Iran more hesitant to strike a deal.</p> \n<p>Adding an extra degree of uncertainty to all this, on Tuesday morning AP reported that Zarif had <a href=""http://bigstory.ap.org/article/d133c9b057514ba7a316f0063c83f36e/iran-says-gop-letter-suggests-us-not-trustworthy"" target=""_blank"">issued a new statement</a>, this one saying that Cotton's letter showed that the US was ""not trustworthy."" Had Zarif changed his mind? Was he trying to placate hard-liners? Had they pressured him to change tacks? It's not clear, and that speaks to the uncertainty of all this.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, in Washington, Cotton's letter has been extremely polarizing. So far, <a href=""http://www.politico.com/story/2015/03/iran-letter-could-backfire-gop-dissenters-say-115922.html"" target=""_blank"">seven Republican senators</a> have come out <i>against</i> the letter, saying it went too far or, in the case of Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker, warning that it could politically backfire and make passing new sanctions more difficult.</p> \n<p>Vice President Joe Biden <a href=""http://www.politico.com/story/2015/03/tom-cotton-joe-biden-iran-letter-defense-115925.html"" target=""_blank"">said in a statement</a>, ""In 36 years in the United States Senate, I cannot recall another instance in which senators wrote directly to advise another country — much less a longtime foreign adversary — that the president does not have the constitutional authority to reach a meaningful understanding with them.""</p> \n<h3>Has a<span>nything funny happened as part of this?</span>\n</h3> \n<p>Oh yes. Much has been made of the tone of Cotton's letter, which comes across like a super-condescending Schoolhouse Rock rehash. For example, more than a few puzzled observers have pointed out that Cotton's letter explained term limits to an Iranian president who is himself term-limited.</p> \n<p>Critics of the letter have also gleefully shared <a href=""http://www.lawfareblog.com/2015/03/the-error-in-the-senators-letter-to-the-leaders-of-iran/"" target=""_blank"">this blog post</a>, by Harvard constitutional law scholar and former Bush-administration lawyer Jack Goldsmith, pointing out that Cotton's letter explaining the Constitution actually got part of the Constitution wrong. The error was pretty minor: Cotton said that the Senate ratifies treaties, when technically the Senate votes to ""gives its advice and consent, empowering the president to proceed with ratification."" Goldsmith conceded it was a ""technical point,"" but it's never ideal to have a Bush administration legal heavyweight write, ""in a letter purporting to teach a constitutional lesson, the error is embarrassing.""</p> \n<p>And the tone of Zarif's official response, an act of diplomatic trolling, is, depending on your point of view, either hugely insulting or hilarious (or maybe both). He wrote, for example, ""it seems that the authors not only do not understand international law, but are not fully cognizant of the nuances of their own Constitution when it comes to presidential powers in the conduct of foreign policy.""</p>",Politics

"The ""decline"" of marriage isn't a problem",http://www.vox.com/2015/3/25/8285169/marriage-decline-causes,What liberals and conservatives both get wrong about marriage and economics.,"<p>For decades now, a dispute has raged between liberals and conservatives about whether the decline in marriage is a cause or a consequence of economic problems for the American working class. <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/10/opinion/david-brooks-the-cost-of-relativism.html"">Conservatives like David Brooks believe</a> a crisis of morals is driving poverty up. <a href=""http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/03/11/when-values-disappear/"">Liberals like Paul Krugman counter</a> that this is backward, and it's working-class economic decline that's driving the crisis of values.</p> \n<p>They're both wrong — and not just about their explanations for the problem. They're wrong about the idea that there is a problem to explain.</p> \n<p>This is clarified by looking at two pieces of data. One is international comparisons of marriage trends; the other is actual outcomes for American children. Globally, we don't see low marriage rates leading to widespread poverty, nor do we see poorer countries exhibiting lower marriage rates. Instead, the countries with higher rates of out-of-wedlock births are generally the ones with the most fortunate working classes, while countries that are considerably poorer than the United States have stronger marriage norms.</p> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3536970/Screen_Shot_2015-03-23_at_7.40.03_PM.0.0.png"" alt=""Screen_Shot_2015-03-23_at_7.40.03_PM.0.0.png"" data-chorus-asset-id=""3536970""></p> \n<p>But the decline in marriage is no black fly in the chardonnay, either. It's true there is a lot of very persuasive observational data to indicate that children raised by stable, loving couples end up better off than children whose family lives are disrupted by divorce or breakups. But what we don't see is the aggregate increase in children borne by unmarried women leading to bad aggregate outcomes. Instead, the <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/5/25/5748178/todays-teenagers-are-the-best-behaved-generation-on-record"">current generation of teenagers is the best-behaved on record</a>. Young people are doing less drugs, having fewer teen pregnancies, and even doing better at meeting federal exercise guidelines. The <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/4/28/5661628/the-graduation-rate-hits-80-percent-nationally-but-big-gaps-remain"">high school graduation rate is at an all-time high</a>, and so is the <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/12/4/7329207/millennials-incomes-falling"">share of the population with a college degree</a>.</p> \n<h3>How marriage fights poverty</h3> \n<p>One thing conservatives are absolutely right about is that marriage is an extremely powerful tool in the war on poverty. What conservatives are less good at is explaining <em>how and why</em> this works. Marriage's potency as an anti-poverty tool is largely a mechanical result of how poverty is defined in the United States, paired with the existence of basic household economies of scale.</p> \n<p>A woman working 40 hours a week, 50 weeks a year, at the federal minimum wage of $7.25 will find herself earning $14,500 a year — well above the federal poverty level. If she has a kid, her two-person household will slip below the poverty line — even if she's working the same hours. But if she marries another single mom with an identical job, their new four-person household makes $29,000 a year — and is no longer poor, according to the government. Indeed, they could even have a fifth child and <em>still</em> not be poor.</p> \n<p>If every poor adult in America married another poor adult, in other words, we would see a significant drop in the poverty rate. Nobody's actual income would have increased, of course, but through the magic of statistics we would achieve a significant win in the war on poverty.</p> \n<p>And of course, if every poor person in America were to fall in love with a quality partner and form a fulfilling lifelong partnership, that would be great news! Indeed, one is strongly inclined to say it would be great news for much deeper reasons than anything related to economics.</p> \n<p>By the same token, however, passing a law saying every poor unmarried adult is going to get flogged on Valentine's Day would almost certainly reduce poverty. What it wouldn't do is actually make people better off. What would happen is some single people would be flogged (bad) and some newly married people would be unhappy in their relationships (also bad).</p> \n<h3>A roommate could be as good as a husband</h3> \n<p>Some of this goes to show there's a level of arbitrariness to our definitions of household income and poverty. But it really is the case that bigger households have economic advantages. It does not cost twice as much to heat a home for two. Nor do you need two times the cable subscriptions. Bulk purchases of food (or, for that matter, toilet paper) are more efficient than shopping for one. And of course, a multi-person household can share things like kitchen space and bathrooms.</p> \n<p>This is why when I first moved to Washington, DC, and didn't make much money I lived with roommates.</p> \n<p>But eventually I started making more money and moved out of the group house I was renting to a shiny new one-bedroom condo. Because my monthly mortgage payments were substantially higher than my share of the old group house rent, I ended up with slightly <em>less</em> disposable income than I had before the raise. But that's not a wildly unusual situation for an urban professional who's getting a bit long in the tooth. You decide you want to live alone, and you're willing to endure a moderate financial sacrifice for the sake of personal space.</p> \n<p>The relationship between marriage and economic prosperity should be seen in somewhat similar terms. In places where women have very few economic opportunities, they can't afford to be too choosy about marriage partners. Where women are more empowered, they become choosier. At times, this greater choosiness leaves them with less money<em> </em>than they would otherwise have. But that's the point. It's precisely because women are more empowered that they can afford<em> </em>to trade off economic security for other benefits.</p> \n<h3>Marriage is getting better</h3> \n<p>Unlike the conservative or liberal pessimist narratives, the optimist narrative fits a broad range of data. Marriage has declined more in the Nordic countries than in the United States, but more in the United States than Portugal, because the USA is between the Nordics and Portugal in terms of economic security for working-class women. And marriage rates are lower almost everywhere in 2015 than they were in 1915 because working-class women have more economic opportunity today in virtually every country than they did 100 years ago.</p> \n<p>Marriage has long been, at least in part, a deeply gendered economic arrangement, so it's natural that growing economic opportunities for women would transform the meaning of marriage. In particular, it has made women choosier about their partners. That led to a surge in divorces in the 1970s, followed by a <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/04/upshot/how-we-know-the-divorce-rate-is-falling.html?abt=0002&amp;abg=1"">slow and steady decline in the divorce rate ever since 1981</a> or so.</p> \n<p>Among college graduates, marriage has been re-founded on a new basis. As Betsey Stevenson and Justin Wolfers put it, we have gone from <a href=""http://users.nber.org/~jwolfers/papers/MarriageandtheMarket.pdf"">shared production to shared consumption</a> and formed more egalitarian partnerships based on common preferences rather than a swap of housework for rent money. This new model of partnerships has thus far not taken root as strongly in working-class relationships. That's unfortunate. But it's a mistake to believe women are making themselves worse off than their next actually available alternative. As women have become more empowered, they have gotten pickier. That means more single women, and a higher quality of relationship for the non-single.</p> \n<p>None of this is to deny either the conservative premise that many people would be better off in stable, loving relationships or the liberal premise that more and better employment opportunities for working-class men could make such relationships more likely.</p> \n<p>But to explain a social crisis, you first have to establish that a crisis is occurring. There is no major dimension on which American children are doing worse in 2015 than they were in 1975. That should be a huge giveaway that the decline of marriage is a consequence of something good — prosperity, especially for women — rather than a cause or a consequence of something bad.</p>",Politics

How Barack Obama made the old Daily Show obsolete,http://www.vox.com/2015/3/31/8319649/trevor-noah-daily-show,The next Daily Show will be very different from the old Daily Show.,"<p><i>The Daily Show</i> and <i>The Colbert Report</i> were both responses to the Bush years. They were about the alienation liberals felt from their country at a moment when Fox News seemed the authentic expression of the American psyche and George W. Bush kept winning elections.</p> \n<p>And then liberals began winning elections. The constant crises of Obama's early presidency gave the shows plenty to work with at first, but as the sirens quieted and Washington slowly froze into gridlock, the shows began to lose steam. The disappointments of the Obama administration didn't offer the comic fodder of the outrages of the Bush administration. Colbert and Stewart became the beloved voices of the dominant political coalition; punching Fox News was punching down. Colbert announced his move to CBS. Stewart announced his retirement.</p> \n<p>Their replacements — Trevor Noah at <i>The Daily Show</i> and Larry Wilmore in Colbert's slot — are responses to the Obama era. Both are talented black comedians with a particular skill for limning America's complicated, and often infuriating, racial politics. Their work on <i>The Daily Show</i> focused on the racial controversies of the Obama era. And their takeover is a recognition of one of the lessons of Obama's presidency: American politics isn't moving past race. It's moving into it. And so, too, is the news business.</p> \n<center> \n<div style=""background-color:#000000;width:520px;""> \n<div style=""padding:4px;"">\n<iframe frameborder=""0"" height=""288"" width=""512"" src=""http://media.mtvnservices.com/embed/mgid:arc:video:thedailyshow.com:a832fe72-268d-49a0-a292-0c8c75e30ae4""></iframe> \n<p style=""text-align:left;background-color:#FFFFFF;padding:4px;margin-top:4px;margin-bottom:0px;font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:12px;""><b><a href=""http://thedailyshow.cc.com/"">The Daily Show</a></b><br><a href=""http://thedailyshow.cc.com/full-episodes/"">Daily Show Full Episodes</a>,  <a href=""http://thedailyshow.cc.com/videos"">More Daily Show Videos</a>,  <a href=""http://www.cc.com/full-episodes"">Comedy Central Full Episodes</a></p> \n</div> \n</div> \n</center> \n<h3>Obama's racialized presidency</h3> \n<p>The Obama era began amid the hope that American politics was finally moving beyond its old racial divisions. Five years later, something closer to the opposite has happened: partisan politics has cut new racial divisions into American life.</p> \n<p>Consider <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2014/05/01/donald-sterling-shows-the-separate-realities-of-democrats-and-republicans-about-race/"">this graph</a> from Brown University political scientist Michael Tesler:</p> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3559342/teslersterling1__2_.0.png"" alt=""race polarization"" data-chorus-asset-id=""3559342""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">(<a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2014/05/01/donald-sterling-shows-the-separate-realities-of-democrats-and-republicans-about-race/"">Michael Tesler</a>)</p> \n<p>That is ... insane. There's a 42-point partisan gap on whether some racist oaf should be forced to sell the Clippers. There's a 38-point partisan gap on whether a searing film about slavery should win an Oscar. There's a 48-point gap on a Florida murder trial.</p> \n<p>It wasn't always this way. In 1984, when Bernhard Goetz shot four young African-American men that he thought were going to mug him, there was no difference in the way Democrats and Republicans responded. Even the O. J. Simpson trial didn't lead to a large partisan cleavage:</p> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3559346/teslersterling2__2_.0.png"" alt=""teslersterling2__2_.0.png"" data-chorus-asset-id=""3559346""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">(<a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2014/05/01/donald-sterling-shows-the-separate-realities-of-democrats-and-republicans-about-race/"">Michael Tesler</a>)</p> \n<p>But that was before Barack Obama was elected president.</p> \n<p>Tesler's book <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Obamas-Race-Election-Post-Racial-American/dp/0226793834""><i>Obama's Race: The 2008 Election and the Dream of a Post-Racial America</i></a> describes an inconvenient truth of the 2008 election: it was the most racialized election in modern American history. There's been no recent campaign in which racial attitudes did as much to drive political behavior. And that's continued after the election.</p> \n<p>Tesler worked with political scientist (and <em>Obama's Race</em> co-author) David Sears to test how racial attitudes — measured using a standard survey — drove the approval ratings of different presidents. The curve for Obama looks unlike anything else on the chart:</p> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3560016/Screen_Shot_2015-03-31_at_2.08.57_PM.0.png"" alt=""Screen_Shot_2015-03-31_at_2.08.57_PM.0.png"" data-chorus-asset-id=""3560016""></p> \n<p class=""caption""><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Obamas-Race-Election-Post-Racial-American/dp/0226793834"">Obama's Race.</a></p> \n<p>And all those numbers predate Ferguson, and Eric Garner, and #BlackLivesMatter. Attitudes toward race have long been a driving force in attitudes toward American politics. But in the Obama years, attitudes toward politics have begun driving attitudes toward race. The result is that racial controversies are a bigger part of American politics right now than they were before Obama's election.</p> \n<h3>Why the media suddenly cares about Ferguson</h3> \n<center> \n<div style=""background-color:#000000;width:520px;""> \n<div style=""padding:4px;"">\n<iframe frameborder=""0"" height=""288"" width=""512"" src=""http://media.mtvnservices.com/embed/mgid:arc:video:comedycentral.com:39920165-f5e3-43f9-8b92-bdeaf0487d05""></iframe> \n<p style=""text-align:left;background-color:#FFFFFF;padding:4px;margin-top:4px;margin-bottom:0px;font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:12px;""><b><a href=""http://www.cc.com/shows/the-nightly-show"">The Nightly Show</a></b><br>Get More: <a href=""http://www.cc.com/shows/the-nightly-show/full-episodes"">The Nightly Show Full Episodes</a>,<a href=""https://www.facebook.com/thenightlyshow"">The Nightly Show on Facebook</a>,<a href=""http://www.cc.com/shows/the-nightly-show/video-clips"">The Nightly Show Video Archive</a></p> \n</div> \n</div> \n</center> \n<p> </p> \n<p>A central challenge of covering Washington right now is that barely anything gets done. The Senate can't even pass a bill to crack down on human trafficking. There's less happening, and readers (rightfully) care less about the little that <i>is</i> happening.</p> \n<p>The opposite is true when it comes to what the internet has taken to calling ""social justice"" — roughly, the fights over racial, gender, and sexual discrimination, both overt and covert.</p> \n<p>America is in the midst of wrenching demographic changes. Depending on <a href=""http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/06/04/are-minority-births-the-majority-yet/"">which data set</a> you believe, the percentage of US infants who were a racial or ethnic minority might already have tipped past 50 percent. In 2012, Obama won reelection with less than 40 percent of the white vote. The racial makeup of the country is changing, fast — and the force of that change can be felt in politics, and particularly in the political issues that young voters care about.</p> \n<p>For the media, though, there's a force multiplier: the internet broadly — and social media specifically — increasingly dominates how people get their news (and that goes double for satirical news clips meant to go viral). And identity issues dominate online. If you ever wonder why there seems to be so much more coverage of identity politics these days, the answer, basically, is Facebook and Twitter, where stories that tap into people's identities dominate. BuzzFeed, perhaps the most successful publisher of the social-media age, demonstrates this particularly clearly: it's an <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/5/20/5730762/buzzfeeds-founder-used-to-write-marxist-theory-and-it-explains"">identity-activation machine</a>.</p> \n<p>Some lament this trend, or at least its effects. My view is a bit more optimistic: for a long time, white men held the keys to the media, had relatively little data on which stories their audience actually cared about, and had little ability to find new audiences for stories that reached into new territory. So the media was heavily biased toward stories white men thought important, and toward audiences that were well-served by publications running stories white men thought important.</p> \n<p>The internet has set off an explosion of media outlets, so more kinds of stories are being tried. There's a vast increase in reader data, so it's clearer which stories get read. And audiences now have the power to send stories viral, so there's more reward to writing about issues that affect people who may not already be part of your core audience. There are dark sides to the chase for viral traffic, of course, but on the whole, I think this is a pretty positive development in American journalism: it's helping us realize we were systematically giving too little attention to stories that weren't of interest to the kinds of people who dominated newsrooms.</p> \n<p>But love it or hate it, it means stories that touch on people's core identities — and race, gender, and sexual orientation are about as core as identities get — are going to get a lot more coverage in the coming years.</p> \n<p>A decade ago, a police shooting in Ferguson, or a religious freedom law in Indiana, might have been regional stories at best. Today, they become national stories with ease. Satirical news shows, by their nature, follow the news. As the news changes, they need to change, too.</p> \n<p>This was the reality <i>The Daily Show</i> sensed when it brought Noah and Wilmore into the stable. And it's the future being bet on by making them hosts of their own shows. The Stewart-and-Colbert era was tuned for post-9/11 liberalism — and the post-9/11 media. The Noah-and-Wilmore era is tuned for post-Obama liberalism — and the post-social media.</p> \n<p><b>Correction:</b> Due to butterfingers, this article originally stated that Obama won reelection in 2012 with less than 30 percent of the white vote. It should have said 40 percent of the white vote, and now does.</p> \n<p><b>WATCH: 'Barack Obama on why he's such a polarizing president'</b></p> \n<!-- CHORUS_VIDEO_EMBED ChorusVideo:64884 -->",Politics

Buhari, as a northerner, was seen by many voters as more likely to end the conflict. His supporters also say his military past would make him a more competent commander in chief.</p> \n<p>Nigerians are sick of the corruption that has spiraled under Jonathan — in one example of how bad things have gotten, the central bank chief admitted last year that $20 billion had disappeared from its reserves — and Buhari's strong anti-corruption message appears to have hit home.</p> \n<p><span>Another factor that may have helped Buhari is that this vote appears to have been cleaner than past Nigerian elections.

But the situation remains a tense one. If Jonathan disputes the result, or if his supporters allege they have been robbed of victory, there are very real fears that violence could break out. If it does not, though, that would be a good sign for democracy in Africa's most populous country.</p>",Politics
I'm British. America's weird obsession with Neville Chamberlain bafflesÂ me.,http://www.vox.com/2015/4/7/8354209/chamberlain-munich-obsession-british,Why does this British prime minister come up all the time in US politics?,"<p>In 1938, British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain returned home from the Munich Conference, victoriously waving an agreement with Adolf Hitler. The deal allowed Hitler to take over part of Czechoslovakia if he promised not to seize any more European territories. Chamberlain declared he had achieved ""peace in our time.""</p> \n<p>A few weeks later, Hitler broke his promise, and World War II followed shortly after. Chamberlain and Munich have forever since been associated with the naiveté and folly of appeasement.</p> \n<p>That memory, oddly enough, seems far stronger in America than it does in the UK. As a British reporter who previously covered politics in London, I almost never heard the words ""Chamberlain"" or ""Munich."" But in the month since I relocated to the United States, I've heard them cited nearly constantly by American politicians.</p> \n<p>Nearly everything, it seems, is another ""Chamberlain in Munich"" moment. Republican Senator Mark Kirk, for example, said of President Obama's framework Iran nuclear agreement, ""Neville Chamberlain got a lot of more out of Hitler."" In a <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YK0d8ENS__c"">telling moment</a> in 2008, a conservative radio host compared Obama to Chamberlain, but when pressed was unable to say who Chamberlain was or what he did.</p> \n<p>As a Brit, this American obsession with Neville Chamberlain is pretty baffling. We just don't think about him that much in the UK, but in the US he's referenced so frequently in politics it can sometimes feel as if the Americans have enlisted him as their own, to better renounce him.</p> \n<p>What is going on? Why are Americans so fixated on a man that led my country for all of three years?</p> \n<h3>Churchill vs. Chamberlain in America's Cold War politics</h3> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""3578862"" alt=""118380780.0.jpg"" src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3578862/118380780.0.jpg""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Postwar leaders looked to another British prime minister, Winston Churchill, as a better model than Chamberlain. (Central Press/Hulton Archive/Getty Images)</p> \n<p>In American politics, the habit of accusing one of another of being just like Neville Chamberlain began shortly after the end of World War II, but in a different context: the Cold War. It was this bipolar struggle against the Soviet Union, which began immediately after the end of the WWII, that set the American obsession with avoiding appeasement at all costs.</p> \n<p>""The major presidential candidates almost ritualistically smeared their opponents as 'weak,' as insufficiently vigilant, as likely to give away the store to the wily and cunning Soviets,"" Fredrik Logevall and Kenneth Osgood wrote in 2010 for the <a href=""http://www.worldaffairsjournal.org/article/ghost-munich-americas-appeasement-complex"">World Affairs Journal</a>. ""Republicans did it; Democrats did it.""</p> \n<p>Positioning oneself as tough and unbending toward American adversaries went down well with the Cold War public. Joseph M. Siracusa, in another account of <a href=""http://www.americanforeignrelations.com/E-N/The-Munich-Analogy-America-s-munich-generation.html#ixzz3WTUOPtkl"">the Munich obsession's roots</a>, cites a 1946 poll in which 60 percent of Americans considered US policy toward the Soviet Union ""too soft.""</p> \n<p>All of this created an environment in which an uncompromising approach was seen as a vote-winner. Anything else opened you to accusations of ""appeasement.""</p> \n<p>And it set the tone for the foreign policy debates in the US for decades. Presidents seeking to justify military action have done so by presenting themselves as anti-Chamberlains, recognizing the terrible danger facing the world in good time. It became common to cite another WWII-era British prime minister, Winston Churchill, as the model.</p> \n<p><a target=""_blank"" href=""http://millercenter.org/president/speeches/speech-5529"">""Appeasement does not work,""</a> George H. W. Bush said on the eve of the First Gulf War in 1990. ""As was the case in the 1930s, we see in Saddam Hussein an aggressive dictator threatening his neighbors.""</p> \n<p>President Clinton's justification in 1999 of the bombing of Yugoslavia was another example. ''What if someone had listened to Winston Churchill and stood up to Adolf Hitler earlier?'' he said.</p> \n<p>Presidents who've sought to negotiate with American adversaries have faced constant accusations of Chamberlain-style appeasement. Critics of Obama's Iran outreach, for example, say he fails to recognize that the Islamic Republic is a foe that cannot be trusted; any deal will make it stronger, and history will judge him as a fool.</p> \n<h3>America's rapid rise to superpower</h3> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""3578824"" alt=""161192090.0.jpg"" src=""https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3578824/161192090.0.jpg""></p> \n<p><span></span></p> \n<p class=""caption""> </p> \n<p class=""caption"">America came out of World War II with the world's most powerful military. (Andy Cross/The Denver Post via Getty Images)</p> \n<p>America came out of World War II as the world's richest and most powerful democracy. It's armed with the world's most powerful military, one that's been highly active in foreign conflicts in the eight decades since the Munich conference.</p> \n<p><span>So it's not really that surprising that the foreign policy debate here tends to portray identifying and neutralizing any Hitler-style threats as a job that largely falls to America. Perhaps Chamberlain doesn't dominate foreign policy debate in the same way in Britain because we simply don't play that kind of dominant global role any more.</span></p> \n<p>It may also be the <em>speed</em> of America's rise to superpower status, Logevall and Osgood suggest, that helped generate the obsession with avoiding a repeat of Munich.</p> \n<p>""In short order, the United States went from being a junior member of the Great Power club to possessing informal hegemony over a sizable part of the globe. Neither before nor after attaining immense international clout, therefore, did Washington have to negotiate and compromise continually to prosper,"" they write.</p> \n<p>For much of Western history, great powers such as France and Britain existed in competitive multipolar worlds where it was necessary to compete, negotiate, and compromise to survive. The US never really had to deal with that: during WWII, it had to outright defeat its enemies. After the war, it has been either locked in the bipolar existential struggle of the Cold War or dominated the globe as its sole superpower.</p> \n<p>This dynamic, Logevall and Osgood say, helped feed an idea that is still central to American foreign policy conversations: the only answer to competing powers is total victory. Compromise or tolerance, in this view, is folly.</p> \n<p>The threats America has faced since the end of the Cold War are, obviously, nowhere near as dire as when Hitler's Germany and its allies seemed on the verge of snuffing out freedom worldwide.</p> \n<p>But that's not the point: the point is that for many Americans, the lesson was that foreign threats can never be managed or contained, but can only be defeated outright — and that failing to do so will only make the problem worse. If this seems bizarre to non-Americans — and believe me, it does to Brits — that's because just about every other country had to learn how to cope with geopolitical adversaries through means other than vanquishing them outright. That is not something the US has really developed a familiarity with. It's great to have strength and resolve, but when this is the only tool in your toolbox, that lack of flexibility can become a weakness, as well.</p>",Politics

The joke was that Obama wasnâ€™t joking,http://www.vox.com/2015/4/27/8502493/obama-white-house-correspondents-dinner,"When Obama brought out Luther, he wasnâ€™t kidding around.","<p>The <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/4/25/8498175/obama-white-house-correspondents-dinner"">White House Correspondents' Dinner</a> has become a strange event. It is, ostensibly, an evening when the president and the press can come together to share a few lighthearted laughs. But it's evolved into a recital of brutal truths — albeit one neither side ever really admits happened.</p> \n<p>The joke of President Obama's performance on Saturday was that he wasn't joking. Everyone just had to pretend he was. Take this section, from the official White House transcript:</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>After the midterm elections, my advisors asked me, ""Mr. President, do you have a bucket list?""  And I said, ""Well, I have something that rhymes with bucket list.’""  (Laughter and applause.)</p> \n<p>Take executive action on immigration?  Bucket.  (Laughter.)  New climate regulations?  Bucket.  It’s the right thing to do.  (Laughter and applause.)</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>The tip-off there is, ""It's the right thing to do."" That's not a joke. That's Obama's actual justification for the aggressive executive actions of his second term — ""fuck it, it's the right thing to do."" But the norms of politics are such that he typically has to frame his actions as routine, dull, even necessary. He has to search for precedent and downplay the consequences.</p> \n<p><!-- CHORUS_VIDEO_EMBED ChorusVideo:69776 --></p> \n<p>It's only on the evening of the White House Correspondents' Dinner when he can say what everyone already knows: his actions are huge, they are controversial, they push the norms of American politics, but fuck it, at a moment when American politics seems increasingly broken, Obama has decided to just go ahead and do what he thinks is right.</p> \n<p>Then there was this line:</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>A few weeks ago, Dick Cheney says he thinks I’m the worst President of his lifetime.  Which is interesting, because I think Dick Cheney is the worst President of my lifetime.  (Laughter and applause.)  It’s quite a coincidence.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>It's funny, sure. But he's not kidding. It's just the thing Obama can't usually say. The humor is in the shock of him actually saying it.</p> \n<p>But the place where Obama stopped being polite and started getting real was when he brought out Luther, his personal anger translator. This was, itself, a way of giving up the game. The Luther joke comes from the Comedy Central sketch show <i>Key and Peele</i>, and the point of it is that Obama, as the first black president, is not allowed to express his anger, as America is terrified of angry black men. And so he's got Luther — the angry black man who can say what he can't.</p> \n<p><iframe width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/GDyO4KzbuiE"" frameborder=""0""></iframe></p> \n<p>On <i>Key and Peele</i>, though, it really is a joke. Key plays Luther. Peele plays Obama. It's two comedians commenting on race and politics. But at the White House Correspondents' Dinner, the whole point was that the joke isn't a joke at all. It was Key playing Luther, but it was Obama playing Obama. Obama's anger translator was actually translating for Obama, working off a script that had to be approved by Obama. And so when Luther spoke, now he really was speaking for Obama:</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>THE PRESIDENT:  In our fast-changing world, traditions like the White House Correspondents’ Dinner are important.</p> \n<p>LUTHER:  I mean, really, what is this dinner?  (Laughter.)  And why am I required to come to it?  (Laughter.)  Jeb Bush, do you really want to do this?  (Laughter.)</p> \n<p>THE PRESIDENT:  Because despite our differences, we count on the press to shed light on the most important issues of the day.</p> \n<p>LUTHER:  And we can count on Fox News to terrify old white people with some nonsense!  (Laughter.)  ""Sharia law is coming to Cleveland.  Run for the damn hills!""  (Laughter.)  Y’all, it’s ridiculous.  (Laughter.)</p> \n<p>THE PRESIDENT:  We won’t always see eye to eye.</p> \n<p>LUTHER:   Oh, and CNN, thank you so much for the wall-to-wall Ebola coverage.  For two whole weeks, we were one step away from the Walking Dead.  (Laughter.)  And then you all got up and just moved on to the next day.  That was awesome.  Oh, and by the way, just if you haven’t noticed, you don’t have Ebola!  (Laughter.)</p> \n<p>THE PRESIDENT:  But I still deeply appreciate the work that you do.</p> \n<p>LUTHER:  Y'all remember when I had that big, old hole in the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico and then I plugged it?  Remember that?  Which ""Obama’s Katrina"" was that one?  Was that 19?  Or was it 20?  Because I can’t remember.  (Laughter.)</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>There are no jokes there. There's just Obama saying what he <em>has</em> to say and Luther saying what Obama <em>actually believes</em>.</p> \n<p>And what Obama believes is that the press is often sensational, trivial, and fearmongering. He thinks they hype negative stories for weeks on end and then refuse to admit their mistake when the horror fizzles. He thinks he gets the blame for catastrophes but little credit for solutions. He thinks the media has a deep bias toward negative stories (which, of course, we do).</p> \n<p>But if Obama is annoyed at the press, he is appalled at Republicans who deny climate change — and are trying to block him from taking action to stop climate change. Obama believes global warming a generational threat, and so when he sees James Inhofe, the chair of the Senate's Committee on Environment and Public Works, <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/2/26/8116981/james-inhofe-global-warming"">throwing snowballs</a> on the chamber's floor, well, his thoughts on that would likely be seen as unpresidential if he gave them voice.</p> \n<p><iframe src=""https://vine.co/v/O2J1F0lYIeY/embed/postcard"" width=""600"" height=""600"" frameborder=""0""></iframe> \n<script src=""https://platform.vine.co/static/scripts/embed.js""></script> \n</p> \n<p>Except on the night of the White House Correspondents' Dinner:</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>THE PRESIDENT:  The science is clear.  Nine of the ten hottest years ever came in the last decade.</p> \n<p>LUTHER:  Now, I’m not a scientist, but I do know how to count to 10.  (Laughter.)</p> \n<p>THE PRESIDENT:  Rising seas, more violent storms.</p> \n<p>LUTHER:  We’ve got mosquitos. Sweaty people on the train, stinking it up.  It’s just nasty.  (Laughter.)</p> \n<p>THE PRESIDENT:  I mean, look at what’s happening right now.  Every serious scientist says we need to act.  The Pentagon says it’s a national security risk.  Miami floods on a sunny day, and instead of doing anything about it, we’ve got elected officials throwing snowballs in the Senate!</p> \n<p>LUTHER:  Okay, Mr. President.  Okay, I think they’ve got it, bro.</p> \n<p>THE PRESIDENT:  It is crazy!  What about our kids?  What kind of stupid, shortsighted, irresponsible bull --  (Laughter and applause.)</p> \n<p>LUTHER:  Wow!  Hey!  (Applause.)</p> \n<p>THE PRESIDENT:  What?!</p> \n<p>LUTHER:  All due respect, sir.  You don’t need an anger translator.  (Laughter.)  You need counseling.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>So the joke here was that Obama is so angry about the Republican Party's climate denialism that he even managed to scare his anger translator. This isn't a joke. It's just Obama's opinion, delivered with a fury that's rarely allowed in American politics.</p> \n<p>Read these sentences again: ""Every serious scientist says we need to act. The Pentagon says it's a national security risk. Miami floods on a sunny day, and instead of doing anything about it, we've got elected officials throwing snowballs in the Senate!"" Is there a single one of them that you think Obama doesn't believe? <span>He gets right up to the first syllable of calling it ""bullshit."" </span><span>But since he said it at the White House Correspondents' Dinner, he can just say he's kidding, even though everyone knows he's not kidding in the least. </span></p> \n<p>To paraphrase Bruce Banner, Obama's secret is he's always angry, at least about this stuff — but the White House Correspondents' Dinner is the only weekend of the year in which he's allowed to show it, because the press has promised, for that one day of the year, to pretend they didn't notice.</p> \n<b>WATCH: 'President Obama on why he's so polarizing'</b> \n<!-- CHORUS_VIDEO_EMBED ChorusVideo:64884 -->",Politics
The bipartisan corruption of American politics,http://www.vox.com/2015/5/1/8519077/clinton-foundation-corruption,Donâ€™t let the Clinton Foundation distract from the real corruption in American politics.,"<p>The money at the nexus of the Clinton Foundation, Bill Clinton's speaking shop, and Hillary Clinton's State Department is unnerving. But the amount of coverage it's getting might make you think it's <em>unusually</em> unnerving by the standards of modern American politics.</p> \n<p>Nope. In fact, it's not even the most unnerving part of Hillary Clinton's campaign.</p> \n<p>The Clinton Foundation is a great topic to investigate because its structure is strange, it namesake is an ex-president, and there are lots of documents and disclosures that can power stories. These investigations are worthy, and these pieces should be written — which is why we've been <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/4/18/8447919/why-hillary-clintons-foundation-problem-isnt-going-away"">writing</a> <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/4/28/8501643/Clinton-foundation-donors-State"">them</a> at Vox.</p> \n<p>But it's also worth looking past the smoke to the purported fire: the basic concern is that the Clinton Foundation gave corporations and even foreign governments a way to donate huge amounts of money to the Clintons without seeming like they were donating huge amounts of money to the Clintons — and those donations could have given them unusual access or influence in Hillary Clinton's State Department, or to her hypothetical future White House.</p> \n<p>When you look at it that way, what becomes clear is that whatever the conflicts in the Clinton Foundation's finances, the daily corruption that powers modern presidential campaigns is much, much worse.</p> \n<h3>How to buy a Clinton</h3> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""3656038""><img src=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3656038/80390753.jpg""></div> \n<p>With the Clinton Foundation, there is at least the <em>possibility</em> that donors wanted to give money to an actual philanthropy trying to save and improve lives in poor countries. The same can't be said for the daily money-grubbing that fuels modern political campaigns.</p> \n<p>Take, well, Hillary Clinton. She <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/4/28/8509573/Clinton-fundraising-Wall-Street"">kicked off</a> her presidential fundraising on Tuesday with a series of events on Wall Street. Guests paid $2,700 to attend, while hosts had to bundle $27,000 in donations each. These are big, direct donations to Hillary Clinton's campaign. They are being made by people who have paid to be in a room with Hillary Clinton. They are being made with the express purpose of helping Hillary Clinton win the presidency. They are being made by people whose livelihoods are regulated by the very agencies Clinton seeks to control.</p> \n<p>The thing that people worry was quietly happening at the Clinton Foundation, in other words, is publicly happening with the Clinton campaign.</p> \n<p>You might argue, of course, that individual donors are limited by that $2,700 cap. How much influence can anyone really buy for $2,700? How much goodwill is really purchased by getting 10 of your friends to bundle their contributions alongside yours? Particularly when Chicago businessman Fred Eychaner <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2015/02/19/here-are-the-7-biggest-donors-to-the-bill-hillary-and-chelsea-clinton-foundation/"">gave more</a> than <em>$25 million</em> to the Clinton Foundation. One guy. More than $25 million. How can you compare that to donations capped at $2,700?</p> \n<p>You can't. But donations to the Clinton campaign aren't really capped at $2,700. Clinton, like every other major candidate in the race (and probably a few of the not-so-major ones), will have a number of allied Super PACs. The Super PACs will supposedly be independent of Clinton's campaign, but they won't be, not really. Hillary Clinton will be raising money for them directly. Her top surrogates will quietly be urging her richest donors to fund send them bigger and bigger checks. And those checks will get eye-poppingly big.</p> \n<p>Donations to Super PACs, like to the Clinton Foundation, are unlimited. Eychaner can give another $25 million, or another $100 million, if he so chooses. Indeed, one of the reasons Clinton announced so early was that her Super PAC was <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/big-donors-holding-off-making-pledges-to-pro-hillary-clinton-super-pac/2015/02/10/20c4a572-b175-11e4-854b-a38d13486ba1_story.html"">having trouble</a> raising those big checks until she officially entered the race.</p> \n<p>The dynamics behind Clinton's Super PAC are the precise dynamics that people fear existed in the Clintons' foundation. Extremely rich individuals and institutions will give extremely large sums of money in order to get Clinton elected. These donors will get access, influence, and a certain measure of power over her administration — after all, if Clinton wants to run again, she's going to need them to fund her next campaign, too. And there will be no chance that these donors simply wanted to help Bill Clinton distribute HIV/AIDS drugs in the world's poorest countries.</p> \n<h3>How to buy the entire Republican primary field</h3> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""3656056"">\n<img src=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3656056/450129448.jpg""> \n<div class=""caption""> \n<p>That's not how you spell Coke.</p> \n</div> \n</div> \n<p>It's not just Clinton, of course. The Republican candidates will have their own Super PACs. The Koch Brothers, for instance, are coordinating a network of rich Republicans who intend to spend nearly a billion dollars — yes, billion with a ""B"" — on the 2016 election. And there, the corruption has become almost comically explicit.</p> \n<p>Rand Paul <a href=""http://time.com/3822767/charles-koch-david-koch-2015-time-100/"">wrote them</a> a love letter in Time magazine. ""Charles and David Koch are well known for their business success, their generous philanthropic efforts and for their focus on innovation in management,"" he wrote. ""Some also know them for their activism in the political realm."" Yes, I think I heard something about that activism.</p> \n<p>But it's not just Paul. Republican presidential hopefuls are <a href=""http://www.politico.com/story/2015/04/koch-brothers-will-offer-audition-to-jeb-bush-117177.html#ixzz3YgtbCKpV"">literally flying across the country</a> to audition for the Kochs' support:</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>In another surprise, a top Koch aide revealed to POLITICO that Jeb Bush will be given a chance to audition for the brothers’ support, despite initial skepticism about him at the top of the Kochs’ growing political behemoth.</p> \n<p>Sen. Marco Rubio, Sen. Rand Paul and Sen. Ted Cruz debated at the Koch network’s winter seminar in January, and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker made a separate appearance. Those were the candidates who appeared to have a chance at the Koch blessing, and attendees said Rubio seemed to win that round.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>And unlike the donors to the Clinton Foundation, whose political aims are hypothetical and speculative, the Kochs are political activists trying to change the nature of the Republican Party — and the country. And it's working. As Andrew Prokop <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/4/23/8482779/koch-brothers-2016"">wrote</a>, there's no serious Republican presidential hopeful who breaks with the Kochs' core policy commitments — and that's partly because no Republican presidential hopeful who breaks with the Kochs' core policy commitments is going to have the resources needed to be taken seriously:</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>The Kochs have longed seem to prioritize economic issues — shrinking government, slashing entitlement spending, cutting taxes, and reducing regulations — far above other matters. And it hasn't been too long since the big-spending, Medicare-expanding George W. Bush administration drew their ire.</p> \n<p>The prospect of the GOP nominee pledging a major entitlement expansion seems unimaginable now. Instead, the entire party has backed Paul Ryan's plans to overhaul Medicare, to reduce government spending on the program. More broadly, this year's contest features the spectacle of every major hopeful <a href=""http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/mar/3/freedom-partners-praises-bush-cruz-paul-rubio-for-/"">competing to trash</a> the <a href=""http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/mar/3/freedom-partners-praises-bush-cruz-paul-rubio-for-/"">Export-Import Bank</a> — a <a href=""http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/06/ex_im_bank_and_koch_brothers_the_libertarian_campaign_to_kill_the_export.html"">longtime target of the Kochs</a>, who view the agency as exemplifying government interference in the free market. Support for action on climate change, for Obamacare, or for campaign finance reform are all anathema for the vast majority of the expected presidential field — as they are for the GOP in general.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>It actually, unimaginably, gets worse. The Clinton Foundation has agreed to make its donors public, and presidential campaigns and even Super PACs are required by law to make their donors public. We know, sooner or later, who gave money and how much they gave. But there's also the world of 501(c)4 and 501(c)6 organizations, like Karl Rove's Crossroads GPS, where the <a href=""https://www.opensecrets.org/outsidespending/rules.php"">donations are simply secret</a>: the public has no way to know who gave, or how much, even though the candidate might know exactly whom they owe, and why.</p> \n<p>This ""dark"" money has gone from a minor feature of campaign spending to a powerful one. According to <a href=""https://www.opensecrets.org/outsidespending/disclosure.php"">the Center for Responsive Politics</a>, the 2004 presidential election had less than $6 million in dark money; the 2012 election had more than $310 million.</p> \n<p>That means the stories being written about the Clinton Foundation, or about the Koch brothers, simply can't be written about the 501(c)4s — not because the corruption isn't more grievous, but because the information is so much more limited.</p> \n<p>The influence-purchasing that people are worried might have happened, in a loose and indirect way, with the Clinton Foundation, is happening in an obvious and direct way around every single one of the major presidential campaigns —and what's worse is that we're getting used to it, inured to it, tired of complaining about it. The Clinton Foundation is getting so much coverage in part because it's novel. But the much more significant, more daily corruption of American politics is, sadly, becoming routine.</p>",Politics

This <a href=""http://www.nwlc.org/sites/default/files/pdfs/contraceptive_coverage_faq_11.9.11.pdf"">includes</a> but is not limited to oral contraception (a.k.a. the pill), birth control patches, the ring (otherwise known as Nuvaring), the shot (Depo-Provera), IUDs (intrauterine devices), and permanent contraceptives like sterilization.</p> \n<p>The birth control mandate means insurance plans cannot charge co-payments when patients fill any birth control prescription, whether that's for birth control pills, an IUD (<a href=""http://www.plannedparenthood.org/health-topics/birth-control/iud-4245.htm"">which can cost as much as $1,000</a>), or something else.</p> \n<h3>Insurers used a loophole to avoid covering some birth control products</h3> \n<div class=""vox-cardstack""><a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/obamacare-and-contraceptives"">Everything you need to know about Obamacare and birth control</a></div> \n<p> \n<script src=""//embed.vox.com/cardstack.js""></script> \n</p> \n<p>Two recent investigations — one by the <a href=""http://kff.org/private-insurance/report/coverage-of-contraceptive-services-a-review-of-health-insurance-plans-in-five-states/"">Kaiser Family Foundation </a>and another by the <a href=""http://www.nwlc.org/stateofcoverage"">National Women's Law Center</a> — found that not all insurance plans were abiding by these rules.</p> \n<p>Some insurers seemed to blatantly disregard the Obamacare mandate. The KFF study — which looked at a sample of 20 insurers in five states — found one that simply didn't cover the birth control ring and four that ""couldn't ascertain"" whether they covered birth control implants. These are potential violations of the law.</p> \n<p>What was more common, however, was insurers using something called ""reasonable medical management."" This is where insurers restrict access to certain medications when they think there might be a cheaper, equally effective way for patients to get the same treatment — and this did seem to be legal under the health law's birth control mandate, until now.</p> \n<p>This tactic seems to be especially prevalent with birth control patches and rings. These contraceptives use the same hormones as pills. And they have a slightly worse failure rate than the pill. On these contraceptives, 9 out of 100 women using them will become pregnant within a year, versus a 6 percent failure rate with the pill.</p> \n<p>The pill has another advantage over the patch and the ring, too: it tends to be slightly cheaper. So the KFF study finds that some plans are limiting access to rings and patches, offering the pill as an equally effective option.</p> \n<p>One insurer that KFF talked to said it ""cover[s] a birth control pill with no cost-sharing and therefore charges cost-sharing for the NuvaRing, which has the same chemical composition."" Another insurer charges cost-sharing and requires enrollees to ""show medical necessity on why oral contraceptives are not suitable before they will cover the NuvaRing.""</p> \n<h3>The Obama administration's new order: cover all birth control types</h3> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""3438192"">\n<img src=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3438192/shutterstock_174200660.0.jpg""> \n<div class=""caption""> \n<p>The IUD is among the types of birth control that Obamacare requires insurers to cover. (Shutterstock)</p> \n</div> \n</div> \n<p>In new guidance released May 11, the Obama administration essentially said this type of reasonable medical management is illegal — that the mandate in Obamacare ought to be interpreted as requiring insurers to cover every type of birth control.</p> \n<p>This does not, however, mean that insurers have to cover every single birth control product approved by the FDA. The new guidance does give them leeway to limit coverage to certain products so long as they cover all contraceptive types.</p> \n<p>For example: an insurance plan cannot deny a woman coverage for a birth control patch and ask her to use pills instead. This new guidance makes that flatly illegal.</p> \n<p>What it can do, however, is only offer coverage for the generic birth control patch and refuse to pay for the brand-name one.</p> \n<p>Overall, reproductive health advocates were pleased with the new guidance, which they think will better protect women's access to care.</p> \n<p>""It is past time for insurers to adhere to the law and stop telling women that their chosen method isn’t covered or that they must pay for it,"" Gretchen Borchelt, vice president for reproductive rights at the National Women's Law Center, said in a statement. ""We welcome the Administration’s guidance and know it will go a long way to improve the health and economic well-being of women and their families.""</p>",Politics
"If Obama and Clinton are ""affirmative action"" candidates, so are white men",http://www.vox.com/2015/5/12/8586585/obama-clinton-affirmative-action,"Breaking news: in politics, benefiting from your identity is not new.","<p>The Weekly Standard's Joseph Epstein has <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://m.weeklystandard.com/articles/unassailable-virtue-victims_941011.html"">written a piece</a> that's worth responding to because his argument is the kind of thing we'll probably hear a lot more of between now and the 2016 election: that Hillary Clinton, like Barack Obama, is an ""affirmative action"" candidate.</p> \n<p>This, of course, is based on the laughable idea that only women and African Americans — and not white men — have ever benefited politically from their demographics.</p> \n<p>Here's Epstein's main argument:</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>If Hillary Clinton wins the presidency in 2016 she will not only be the nation's first woman president but our second affirmative-action president. By affirmative-action president I mean that she, like Barack Obama, will have got into office partly for reasons extraneous to her political philosophy or to her merits, which, though fully tested while holding some of the highest offices in the land, have not been notably distinguished. In his election, Obama was aided by the far from enticing Republican candidates who opposed him, but a substantial portion of the electorate voted for him because having a biracial president seemed a way of redressing old injustices. They hoped his election would put the country's racial problems on a different footing, which sadly, as we now know, it has failed to do. Many people voted for Obama, as many women can be expected to vote for Hillary Clinton, because it made them feel virtuous to do so. The element of self-virtue—of having an elevated feeling about oneself—is perhaps insufficiently appreciated in American politics.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<h3>Guess who else benefits from their demographic, and always has? White men.</h3> \n<p>The most generous read of the piece is that Obama received and Clinton could receive a boost from voter excitement about what an African American or woman president would be motivated to do to ensure full civil rights for others who share his or her identity, or about the barrier-breaking symbolism of someone who is not a white man being in office.</p> \n<p>Epstein is probably right that, at least on the surface, Obama and Clinton both have an angle that allows them to stand out among white male candidates who don't typically stir up much enthusiasm talking about the struggle and rights of their demographic groups, or about glass ceilings being broken. The obvious —  but apparently overlooked — reason for this is that white men have not, as a group, been oppressed in this country because of their identity.</p> \n<p>Most important, to argue that only members of racial minority groups and women have ever benefited from their identity in elections is absurd.</p> \n<p>Epstein seems to forget that there are other ways to benefit from your identity: such as being a white man.</p> \n<p>Women and black Americans were legally or practically (because of racism and sexism) prohibited from making serious runs for president for the vast majority of our country's history, making white men the <i>only </i>ones who had a chance to compete or win until very recently.</p> \n<p>And more recent data confirms that being white and male can still give a politician a boost among a certain percentage of the population. In 2008, <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/the_big_idea/2008/08/if_obama_loses.html"">5 percent of white voters </a>acknowledge that they, personally, would not vote for a black candidate. This year, an <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.blogher.com/snippets/hillary-clinton-2016-poll-says-voters-ready-woman"">Emily's List poll</a> found that 75 percent of Americans thought a woman president would be a good thing — but that still leaves 25 percent who aren't open to the idea. <span>This happened even in what some would complain is a far too politically correct society, where Epstein argues that perceived ""victims"" thrive.</span></p> \n<p>Epstein's affirmative action argument only makes sense if you imagine white men as completely neutral — free of race and gender, and thus incapable of enjoying any political boost connected to their identities — and if you think the benefits they enjoy (and have always enjoyed) are the only ones that are standard and fair. Even people who resent the particular kind of excitement around Obama and Clinton's campaigns should be able to look at the evidence and admit that's not the case.</p>",Politics
Will Republicans' stronghold in Congress cripple their quest for the White House?,http://www.vox.com/2015/5/12/8587629/thomas-schaller-stronghold-republican-party,A new book argues that the House GOP has moved the party to the right.,"<p>Could the Republicans' congressional strength be the party's greatest weakness as it tries to retake the White House?</p> \n<p>That's what Tom Schaller, a political scientist at the University of Maryland Baltimore County, argues in his book <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/The-Stronghold-Republicans-Captured-Surrendered/dp/0300172036""><em>The Stronghold</em></a>, released earlier this year. The national GOP, Schaller says, should now be understood as a ""Congress-centered"" and ""House-heavy"" party — and this helps explain why its members have lurched to the right.</p> \n<p>Republican members of Congress are setting the national party's agenda, he says. But they're doing it in a way that suits their own specific political needs, rather than those of the party's presidential contenders.</p> \n<p><q class=""center"" aria-hidden=""true"">Conservative Republicans in Congress have ""quite rationally moved the party ever rightward,"" Schaller argues</q></p> \n<p>The vast majority of Republican members of Congress, Schaller argues, don't have to appeal to a presidential-year electorate that has more young and racially diverse voters. Instead, for their own benefit, they'd prefer to ""double down on the strategy of maximizing the power Republicans derive from their dwindling older, white, male voter base,"" he writes.</p> \n<p>Therefore, on issues like immigration, Republicans have been tailoring their policies and political strategies to win their base — not to get the Republican nominee elected president. ""Because conservative Republicans in Congress have paid little electoral price for their policy positions and political choices,"" Schaller writes, ""they quite rationally moved the party ever rightward.""</p> \n<p>The result is a party that is practically <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/8/4/5960095/what-would-it-take-for-democrats-to-win-the-house"">guaranteed control</a> of the House of Representatives but has a harder time winning presidential elections, according to Schaller.</p> \n<h3>A ""feedback loop""</h3> \n<p>Schaller starts with the famous RNC ""autopsy"" of the 2012 election results. The <a href=""http://goproject.gop.com/"">March 2013 report</a> recommended that the party ""embrace and champion comprehensive immigration reform,"" and govern in a more ""inclusive and appealing manner."" GOP governors, the report said, should become the face of the party.</p> \n<p>House Republicans didn't listen, to say the least. They refused to act on the <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/immigration-immigrants-reform-us/what-is-the-senate-immigration-reform-bill"">bipartisan immigration reform bill</a> passed by the Senate in 2013 — or even to offer an alternative of their own. Despite a seemingly unanimous consensus among party elites that the party had to moderate on the issue to appeal to Latinos, the House didn't budge.</p> \n<p>The key thing to understand, Schaller says, is that this decision made perfect sense — House Republicans were responding to the desires of their own electorates. The voters in House Republicans' districts are, in general, whiter, older, and more conservative than the country at large. Perhaps more important, the most conservative voters in these districts are the ones most likely to turn out in GOP primaries. And these voters are more likely to turn out in midterms, too.</p> \n<p><q class=""center"" aria-hidden=""true"">""There is simply no serious or significant centrist movement within the Republican Party""</q></p> \n<p>So winning these voters is crucial for House members looking to build their own careers and for building a durable House majority. But responding to these voters is pulling Republicans further and further to the right, in a way that's hurting their national hopes. This, Schaller argues, leads to a ""feedback loop"" in which Republicans who back very conservative policies keep getting returned to office, despite their policies being out of step with the broader electorate's desires.</p> \n<p>The Republican situation, Schaller says, mirrors the troubles the Democratic Party had in the 1980s. National Democrats then were widely perceived as being too beholden to their own liberal interest groups and constituencies, and lost three presidential elections in a row.</p> \n<p>But centrist politicians like Bill Clinton and the Democratic Leadership Council ""gradually seized control of the party from the failed McGovern-Dukakis liberal wing,"" Schaller argues, and restored the party's presidential competitiveness. ""There is simply no serious or significant centrist movement within the Republican Party, and certainly no center-right analogue to the DLC,"" he writes.</p> \n<h3>""You can run the country out of the House""</h3> \n<p>Schaller goes further than just arguing that the GOP does well in Congress. He also makes the provocative claim that the modern conservative movement might actually view control of the House as <em>more important</em> than the presidency.</p> \n<p>In the Reagan years, conservative activists viewed winning the presidency as their most important goal. But after the GOP takeover of Congress in 1994, it was ""interesting how quickly the attitude changed to 'the presidency would be nice, but the House and Senate are more important,'"" antitax activist Grover Norquist told Schaller.</p> \n<p><q class=""right"" aria-hidden=""true"">""When the house is on fire, you save the baby, not the Van Gogh. And the congressional majorities were our baby"" </q></p> \n<p>The House is particularly important because, unlike the Senate, it can be controlled by a narrow majority.  ""You can run the country out of the House,"" said Norquist.</p> \n<p>""To Democratic ears, the notion that you can govern with the House is patently absurd,"" Schaller told me. But conservatives whose top priority is to limit government expansion can use their control of the House as a crucial veto point to block new proposals. ""Even if you don't have a single senator and you don't have the White House, if you can hold the line in the House you can, quote, 'govern,' if governing means not doing.""</p> \n<p>This calculus became clear to many in 1996, when Bob Dole's presidential candidacy looked beleaguered and the GOP's newly acquired congressional majorities were at stake. Though conservatives agreed that defeating Clinton would be nice, the prospect of Clinton winning with restored control of Congress was far more terrifying to many conservative activists. ""When the house is on fire, you save the baby, not the Van Gogh,"" Norquist told Schaller. ""And the congressional majorities were our baby.""</p> \n<p>Republicans have learned that it's nice to have the White House but necessary to have the House.</p> \n<p>But before getting too carried away here, it's worth remembering Norquist's interests as the head of Americans for Tax Reform. His top priority, for decades, has been preventing new tax increases. And since a president can't raise taxes without Congress, GOP control of one chamber is the best way Norquist can get what he wants.</p> \n<p>Conservatives with other priorities, though, will beg to differ that the country can be run from the House. Since the president has such broad leeway to conduct foreign affairs, conservative foreign policy hawks won't get the results they want until the GOP retakes the White House. And social conservatives won't get the Supreme Court appointees they prefer without a Republican president to appoint them. Many businesses would surely prefer a president who'd push less stringent regulations. And the conservative base, of course, will be eager to prevent Hillary Clinton from winning.</p> \n<h3>Will the GOP's conservatism really hurt its presidential candidate?</h3> \n<p>Schaller's overriding point is that the ideological positioning of the GOP's congressional wing — so focused on an older, whiter electorate — is dragging down its presidential prospects. But there are at least a few reasons for skepticism here:</p> \n<ol> \n<li>After 2014, Republicans' victories in the states are more impressive than ever. It's difficult to assert that their platform has little appeal, or that their congressional wing is hurting their party's overall brand, when they're fresh off such sweeping victories — including in blue states like Maryland and Massachusetts. Yes, this was a low-turnout midterm electorate and not a presidential electorate, but the Republican gains were historic, and they showed that the specter of Republican governance certainly isn't driving angry voters to the polls in off-years.</li> \n<li>Despite the common belief that Mitt Romney had been forced too far to the right during the primaries, polling actually showed that Americans thought they were closer, ideologically, to Romney than to Barack Obama, according to YouGov polling data <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/10/14/what-really-decided-the-2012-election-in-10-graphs/"">reviewed by Lynn Vavreck and John Sides</a>.</li> \n<li>Fundamentals matter in presidential elections far more than policy platforms. And the past three presidential election results have hewed particularly closely to what we'd expect based on GDP alone, as you can see in this chart (<a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/10/14/what-really-decided-the-2012-election-in-10-graphs/"">also from Vavreck and Sides</a>):</li> \n</ol> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""3681090"">\n<img src=""https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3681090/fundamentalschart.png""> \n<div class=""caption""> \n<p>(<a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/10/14/what-really-decided-the-2012-election-in-10-graphs/"" style=""font-size: 0.8em; line-height: 1.65;"">Lynn Vavreck and John Sides</a>)</p> \n</div> \n</div> \n<p>These latter two points in particular suggest a rather limited role for ideology in a presidential race. While it does seem that a very extreme platform can cause voters to turn against a candidate en masse — look at McGovern's result in 1972, or Goldwater's in 1964 above — the GOP's current platform isn't so radioactive, judging by recent outcomes.</p> \n<p>The one caveat here may be the issue of immigration. As <a href=""http://www.newrepublic.com/article/113833/gop-latino-problem-republicans-need-florida-hispanics"">Nate Cohn wrote</a> back in 2013, swing state math means Florida is ""all but a must-win state for Republicans."" Though the state-level GOP is currently thriving there, a presidential nominee who decided to cater to older, whiter voters on immigration might get a different reception.</p> \n<p>Floridians Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio, at least, recognize this challenge. But they'll still face difficulty trying to wrangle the competing desires of its conservative and moderate wings, as <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/1/5/7494179/immigration-republican-president"">Dara Lind has written</a>. So will they manage to blaze their own path and create a platform that appeals to Latinos? Or will the harder-line House conservatives prove to be, as Schaller argues, ""the tail that wags the dog""?</p>",Politics

In 2001, he was the only senator to vote against the Patriot Act. ""If we lived in a country that allowed the government to open your mail, eavesdrop on your phone conversations, or intercept your email communications, that country would not be America,"" he <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.jsonline.com/blogs/news/211162851.html"">said then</a>. Sitting on the Intelligence Committee, he warned of NSA excesses. Many concluded that his warnings were vindicated after Edward Snowden's revelations.</p> \n<h3>Feingold looks like the favorite</h3> \n<p>Feingold's opponent, Sen. Ron Johnson (R-WI) — a businessman new to politics when he took on Feingold in 2010 — looks quite vulnerable. <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://host.madison.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/marquette-poll-russ-feingold-leads-ron-johnson-in-potential-u/article_578c1636-9940-5e19-83c8-3bdfd9bb70b4.html"">An April poll</a> showed Feingold leading him by 16 percentage points (54 to 38) — very grim numbers for an incumbent.

From 2013 to 2014, only six senators were more conservative than Johnson, according to <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.voteview.com/SENATE_SORT113.HTM"">the rankings</a> of political scientists Keith Poole and Howard Rosenthal.</p> \n<p><span>Feingold lost by 5 percentage points in 2010, during the Tea Party wave midterm year.

"Here's how the GOP candidates are answering ""Would you have invaded Iraq?""",http://www.vox.com/2015/5/14/8607903/gop-candidates-iraq,Their answers are similar â€” but different enough to tell us important things about the way these candidates think about the world.,"<p>Even since Fox's Megyn Kelly asked Jeb Bush on Monday whether he would have invaded Iraq in 2003 ""knowing what we know now,"" and he said yes, the candidate has been furiously backtracking. First he claimed that he ""interpreted the question wrong,"" thinking it was about whether he would have invaded given what people knew in 2003 (<a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/5/12/8593983/jeb-bush-learned-the-wrong-lessons-from-the-iraq-war"">Ezra Klein thinks</a> Bush likely did indeed mishear the question). Then he said the very question ""does a disservice to a lot of people who sacrificed a lot"" during the war. Then, on Thursday, <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.newrepublic.com/article/121799/jeb-bush-iraq-war-was-mistake?utm_content=buffer87e12&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_campaign=buffer"">he finally said that</a> ""knowing what we know now, I would have not engaged.""</p> \n<p>It's not just Bush tackling this issue: the broader Republican field has also been weighing in on the question, and their answers are revealing: for one thing, they've almost uniformly said they wouldn't have launched the war. Here's a list of what the candidates have said, with thanks to <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2015/05/13/jeb-bush-is-struggling-to-answer-the-iraq-war-question-so-far-his-gop-rivals-arent/"">Jose DelReal</a> and <a href=""http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2015-05-13/every-republican-rival-has-a-better-iraq-answer-than-jeb-bush"">Dave Weigel</a> — along with a translation of what they actually mean.</p> \n<h3>Rand Paul</h3> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3597504/randspeech.0.png"" alt=""Rand Paul gives a speech."" data-chorus-asset-id=""3597504""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">(Screenshot)</p> \n<p><strong>What he said</strong><b>:</b> A longtime Iraq War critic, Paul has had a field day with Bush's comments, telling the AP ""to say that nothing would happen differently means we’re going to get George Bush 3."" He expanded on that in a CNN interview:</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>I think even at the time invading Iraq was a mistake... given the intelligence. But now I think people should learn their lesson after the war in Libya. All the Republicans should be asked: ""Did you and do you support Hillary's war in Libya?""</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p><strong>What he meant</strong><b>:</b> Paul wants to try to make non-interventionism into a more popular position in the GOP — and pointing out the failures of the Iraq War is a great way to do that. Linking Republican failures in Iraq to Hillary Clinton and the Libya intervention (which some of his opponents supported) is a way of establishing non-interventionism as a conservative policy, and his more hawkish opponents as on the same team as Democrats.</p> \n<h3>Marco Rubio</h3> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3600212/469199162.0.jpg"" alt=""Marco Rubio"" data-chorus-asset-id=""3600212""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">(Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)</p> \n<p><strong>What he said</strong><b>:</b> When asked by Charlie Rose whether he would have supported the invasion ""after finding out that there were no weapons of mass destruction,"" Rubio said <a href=""http://hotair.com/archives/2015/05/13/third-try-from-jeb-bush-iraq-hypotheticals-do-a-disservice-to-fallen-soldiers/?utm_source=twitterfeed&amp;utm_medium=twitter"">no</a>:</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>Well, not only would I not have been in favor of it, President Bush would not have been in favor of it, and he said so ... But, let’s also be fair about the context. Yes, there was intelligence that was faulty, but there was a history with Iraq of evasion, it was a country that had had mobile units in the past that it had used for both CW — chemical weapons — and biological weapons capabilities.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p><strong>What he meant</strong><b>:</b> Rubio is the biggest hawk in the Republican race: his longtime record of taking strong neoconservative positions has put him in a good place to win support from GOP megadonors like <a href=""http://www.politico.com/story/2015/04/marco-rubio-takes-lead-in-sheldon-adelson-primary-117268.html"">Sheldon Adelson</a>. So Rubio took a very smart tack to this question: he distanced both himself and President Bush, a neocon favorite, from the consequences of the Iraq War. Moreover, he managed to show off what he knew about the history of pre-invasion Iraq and the sanctions regime, further demonstrating his foreign policy chops.</p> \n<h3>Ted Cruz</h3> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3585132/468536334.0.jpg"" alt=""Ted Cruz"" data-chorus-asset-id=""3585132""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">(Richard Ellis/Getty Images)</p> \n<p><strong>What he said</strong><b>:</b> ""Knowing what we know now, of course we wouldn’t go into Iraq,"" Cruz said to the Hill:</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>At the time, the intelligence reports indicated that Iraq was developing weapons of mass destruction that posed a significant national security threat to this country. That’s the reason there was such widespread bipartisan support for going into Iraq. ... We now know in hindsight, those intelligence reports were false.</p> \n<p>Without that predicate, it is difficult to imagine the decision would have been made to go into Iraq, and that predicate proved erroneous.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p><strong>What he meant</strong><b>:</b> Though Cruz, like Rubio, denounced the Iraq War, there's a subtle but important distinction: Cruz simply said that there was no reason for war in the absence of Iraqi WMD. Cruz has <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/4/30/8514671/cruz-populism"">tried to differentiate himself</a> from Rubio and from more conventional Republican hawks by expressing skepticism of the use of US military force when there's not a direct threat to the US (Rubio and others are more interested in spreading democracy). The subtle difference in rhetoric reflects this gap, whether the two men intended it or not.</p> \n<h3>Chris Christie</h3> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3520324/465482316.0.jpg"" alt=""Chris Christie"" data-chorus-asset-id=""3520324""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">(Scott Olson/Getty Images)</p> \n<p><strong>What he said</strong><b>:</b> ""President Bush made the best decision he could at the time,"" but ""I don't think you can honestly say that if we knew then that there was no WMD that the country should have gone to war."" He added a Jeb-like twist:</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>I think what we've got to avoid is continuing to go backwards in this country. We need a forward-looking foreign policy that talks about how to reassert American authority and influence.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p><strong>What he meant</strong><b>:</b> Christie isn't exactly known as a foreign policy candidate, but he needed to at least show credibility. So he took a simpler version of Rubio's fairly conventional line: Bush can't be blamed for the bad intelligence, but the war was a mistake. He pivoted to safer territory — phrases like ""reassert American authority and influence.""</p> \n<h3>John Kasich</h3> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2429180/14553161085_0f45c2c51a_b-1.0.jpg"" alt=""14553161085_0f45c2c51a_b-1.0.jpg"" data-chorus-asset-id=""2429180""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">(Ohio.gov)</p> \n<p><strong>What he said</strong><b>:</b> ""There’s a lot of people who lost limbs and lives over there, OK?"" the Ohio governor said to <a href=""http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/local/2015/05/13/gov-john-kasich-talks-iraq.html"">the Columbus Dispatch</a>. He did nonetheless answer:</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>But if the question is, if there were not weapons of mass destruction should we have gone, the answer would’ve been no ... I wouldn’t have seen it as vital to national interests.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p><strong>What he meant</strong><b>:</b> Kasich isn't very well-known relative to his competitors: in <a href=""http://www.publicpolicypolling.com/main/2015/04/walker-clinton-lead-in-nh.html"">New Hampshire</a>, a key primary state, he has the lowest name recognition of any of the main contenders. Butting into this debate is a way of raising his profile, and also for a comparatively obscure governor to show that he can hang (at least a bit) on world politics.</p>",Politics

That's why the saber-rattling hasn't been followed by forceful calls to put American troops in Iraq, particularly when it comes to candidates who have a real shot at winning the primary.</p> \n<p>""I don’t think that will work,"" Jeb Bush told the Times of a possible US-led ground force in Iraq. But he has struggled to define his view of the American relationship with Iraq, at first stumbling over the question of whether he would have gone to war knowing what his brother knew at the time of the 2003 invasion.</p> \n<p>His position now is a labyrinth: He wouldn't have gone to Iraq given what's currently known, the Obama administration made a mistake in withdrawing troops, and he thinks adding US forces would fail.</p> \n<p>Senators Rand Paul of Kentucky and Ted Cruz of Texas, who are running for president, have been opposed to putting new American <a href=""http://www.politico.com/story/2015/02/ted-cruz-isil-ground-troops-114995.html"">""boots on the ground""</a> in Iraq.</p> \n<p>""If the Iraqis are not willing to fight for their country, I don't think I would send more American GIs,"" <a href=""http://www.cnn.com/videos/tv/2015/05/22/lead-intv-rand-paul-foreign-policy-national-security-2016.cnn"">Paul told CNN</a> last week.</p> \n<p>""<span>Senator Paul believes  in protecting American interests in the region, he's been supportive of  air strikes since our consulate and embassy are under threat,"" his spokesman, Sergio Gor, told Vox.

""That would clearly not be in the best interests of the United States, and it’s not something that the president would consider. And incidentally, it’s also not something that the president’s military advisers have recommended at this point.""</p> \n<p>But in the same exchange, Earnest pointedly declined to answer whether Obama is considering a smaller troop increase of 10,000, calling it a ""hypothetical thing."" And he hastened to ""highlight the significant difference between 150,000 US troops and 10,000.""</p> \n<p>After America made a mess in Iraq — sacrificing more than 4,000 US troops and more than $800 billion for no discernible victory other than the removal of Hussein — some believe only America can fix it.</p> \n<p>The debate is likely to continue deep into the 2016 presidential contest, as long as neither Iraqi nor US forces can repel ISIS. Going to war in Iraq didn't feature in the presidential contests before the 1991 and 2003 US wars there because it wasn't on the radar at the time of the elections. Now Americans will get to listen to the arguments for and against going into Iraq as they choose their next president.</p>",Politics

Thatâ€™s worth making public.,"<p>It's not every day that I get attacked by a Pulitzer Prize winner over my journalistic standards. That's what Glenn Greenwald, famous for being NSA leaker Edward Snowden's conduit, did last night on Twitter. He was wrong.</p> \n<p>First, my crime: Agreeing to let senior Clinton aides <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/5/28/8683379/the-state-of-hillary-clintons-campaign-explained-by-senior-campaign"" target=""_blank"">speak</a> on the condition of anonymity and then attributing  what they said about their view of the state of the race and other matters only to senior campaign officials.</p> \n<p>Greenwald's first tweet was mocking.</p> \n<blockquote lang=""en"" class=""twitter-tweet""> \n<p dir=""ltr"" lang=""en"">Clinton campaign officials given full-scale anonymity to explain how awesome the Clinton campaign is <a href=""https://t.co/uqhOJdM8pC"">https://t.co/uqhOJdM8pC</a></p> \n— Glenn Greenwald (@ggreenwald) <a href=""https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/604091922098049025"">May 29, 2015</a>\n</blockquote> \n<p> \n<script charset=""utf-8"" src=""//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js""></script> \n</p> \n<p> </p> \n<p><span>We exchanged a few tweets back and forth, but 140 characters is too short for a full explanation and defense of using anonymous sources and ""background"" material in a story. Greenwald's argument rests on the premise that allowing people to speak without attribution is a sucker move that allows them to gain an advantage by saying things that aren't true without repercussions.</span></p> \n<p>The practice can also dilute the value of anonymous sources who fear for their safety or livelihoods when they blow the whistle on wrongdoing — a neighborhood Greenwald has lived in for a long time. But he ignores the value of background sources in everyday beat reporting, as well as the fundamental difference between reporting on campaigns and reporting on government.</p> \n<h3>What happened?</h3> \n<p>The Clinton campaign invited reporters to come to campaign headquarters in Brooklyn Thursday for a background session with senior campaign officials. All of the roughly three dozen reporters who showed up understood they weren't going to be getting a lot of attributable material before they arrived.</p> \n<p>Though the names of the aides can't be published under the rules of the agreement, there's nothing evasive, in this case, about describing them as senior officials. As the session started, another ground rule was added by the campaign: no direct quotes.</p> \n<p>Paranoid? Yes. Par for the course? Yes. Sinister? No.</p> \n<p>These officials are people who could easily avoid interacting with reporters for the entire campaign if they so chose. Given the option of talking to them or not, major news organizations chose the former.</p> \n<p>The session lasted more than an hour, and they were asked about strategy, fundraising, Clinton's positions on certain policy, and the questions of conflicts of interest that have arisen because she and her husband have raised so much campaign, foundation, and personal money from people with business before the government.</p> \n<p>On many scores, the answers were unsatisfactory. The big news, according to some reports, was that Bill and Chelsea Clinton will attend Hillary's big kickoff speech on June 13.</p> \n<p>The officials dodged on conflicts of interest, maintaining that Americans will view Clinton as a champion for them and not ""special interests."" While it's not surprising they would say that, reporters ask questions both  because predictable responses can be assessed against future realities and because someone might just say something unexpected. The officials also acknowledged the campaign effort is likely to cost between $1 billion and $2 billion.</p> \n<p>All of that's worth knowing.</p> \n<p>Often, reporters hold onto information from briefings like this and weave it into later stories. But many of the reporters in the room yesterday at Clinton headquarters wrote up what was said and attributed it to Clinton officials. The approach at Vox was to be as clear as possible at each turn that the views expressed were those of campaign officials,  leaving it to the reader to decide whether the claims were credible. Greenwald was able to decipher that the officials were less than forthcoming. Amy Chozick and Maggie Haberman of the New York Times wrote that <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/05/28/hillary-clinton-plans-livelier-campaign-schedule-for-june/?_r=0"">candor</a> was in short supply.</p> \n<h3>Gleaning information</h3> \n<p>One of the questions that have concerned Democrats in recent years is whether Clinton has learned anything from her 2008 loss.</p> \n<p>On that, the officials were somewhat more open than on other topics, indicating they won't raise general election money that can't be used in a primary  for a while (a big mistake in 2008), that Clinton is refusing to be controlled by her campaign (a bigger mistake in 2008), and that she won't get caught misunderstanding the importance of how the system of winning delegates for the convention works (the biggest mistake of 2008).</p> \n<p>Ironically, she's running the race she should have run last time — perhaps fighting the last war — in a campaign in which she does not appear to have a legitimate rival for the nomination.</p> \n<p>There's value in understanding that, too.</p> \n<h3>Beat reporting</h3> \n<p>When reporters cover an institution — whether it's a government agency, a corporation, or, say, an international governing body for soccer — they have to find ways to get the institution to state its position on various topics, policies, and controversies. That can be difficult. No one has to talk. And while it would be nice for someone else to do that scut work, the Greenwalds of the world wouldn't be able to do what they do without it.</p> \n<p>How would anyone know when public figures aren't living up to their own standards without knowing what the official line is and whether it's changing over time? Their own standards certainly aren't the only ones that matter, but they're an important part of the mix when it comes to reporting on their successes and failures.</p> \n<p>By talking to senior campaign officials, reporters get the baseline. There's a difference between Clinton saying something on the record and her aides saying it under the cover of anonymity — it affords her an inch or two of distance — but it's not an earth-shaking, journalism-on-the-brink kind of difference.</p> \n<h3>The most important distinction</h3> \n<p>The government or a corporation can be judged on its policies and its actions. The very nature of a campaign is different.</p> \n<p>During the campaign, the candidate doesn't have the power to implement those policies. On most scores, candidates have to be assessed on what they are promising to do — essentially on what they are saying. That means what they say matters. The anonymous advisers are a Splenda to the cane sugar of the candidate, but their message is the candidate's message.</p> \n<p>Again, that's worth knowing. And when it doesn't stack up to reality, it's pretty obvious. In yesterday's Vox story, every bit of information was attributed to these anonymous officials. Greenwald took that to mean the story was no better than a press release. It's a reasonable criticism, but it misses the mark not just for the reasons outlined above. Rather than being credulous, the careful attribution suggests the opposite. This is what they are saying, not necessarily what they believe or what is true.</p> \n<p>The story also observed the ""split-screen"" nature of a campaign that has compartmentalized the conflict-of-interest questions and is all but ignoring them publicly. That may be an untenable formula, but it's a familiar one in Clintonworld.</p> \n<p>Whatever one thinks of Greenwald's methods, the revelations he brought to the world about NSA spying were valuable in reshaping and reinvigorating the national and international debate over civil liberties and the security state. Just like senior Clinton campaign officials, he's worth listening to. But he's applying his ideology about journalism to a situation it doesn't fit. In that way, he misses the mark.</p> \n<p>The fundamental power of journalism is to take information from a small number of people and give it to a larger number of people in the hope and belief that an informed polity will make wise decisions about who gets which powers. Reporting on the official line of a campaign is one of the many avenues of journalism that fits that description.</p>",Politics

There's reason to think it will continue.,"<p>President Obama's standing with the American public is improving as he nears the final 18 months of his presidency, and a combination of solid economic numbers, finding common ground with Republicans, and a diminished need to serve as the partisan leader of Democrats should augur well for the stretch run.</p> \n<p>The economy added 280,000 jobs in May, the largest spike this year, and unemployment remained stable at 5.5 percent, <a href=""http://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm"">the Bureau of Labor Statistics</a> reported Friday. Jason Furman, the chair of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, <a href=""https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2015/06/05/employment-situation-may"">pointed to the increase</a> of 262,000 private sector jobs in May, and 12.6 million over the past 63 months, as an indication of the health of the economy.</p> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""3764044"">\n<img src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3764044/Screen%20Shot%202015-06-05%20at%2010.07.25%20AM.png""> \n<div class=""caption""> \n<p>This graph shows how the economy went from hemorrhaging jobs during the financial crisis to adding them consistently over the past five-plus years.</p> \n</div> \n</div> \n<p>Obama still isn't getting as much credit for the improvement of the economy as he might, but his numbers have been better this year than they were last year. In late May, <a href=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.documentcloud.org/documents/2091162/poll-may-28-31.pdf"">a CBS/New York Times poll</a> of 1,022 adults found that 45 percent of Americans approved of the way he was handling the economy and 49 percent disapproved. The approval number was between 45 percent and 49 percent in four surveys taken this year by the two news organizations or CBS alone. Last year, his numbers ranged from 38 percent to 43 percent in CBS and CBS/New York Times polls.</p> \n<p>""The President has been clear that he believes there is a strong case for  us to make, looking at the economic data, about the significant  progress that our economy has made since the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression,"" White House spokesperson Jennifer Friedman said in an email to Vox. ""That said, the president believes there is more work that needs to be done to strengthen our economy and further  expand economic opportunity for middle-class families.""</p> \n<p>Not surprisingly, the trends in Obama's overall approval ratings have improved as Americans' views of his handling of the economy have risen because jobs and the economy typically rank as the issues most important to them. Obama's approval numbers have risen and stabilized this year, compared with 2014, as the <a href=""http://www.gallup.com/poll/113980/Gallup-Daily-Obama-Job-Approval.aspx"">Gallup daily tracking polls</a> show.</p> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""3764136"">\n<img src=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3764136/Screen%20Shot%202015-06-05%20at%209.42.34%20AM.png""> \n<div class=""caption""> \n<p>Gallup daily tracking polls of President Obama's approval and disapproval ratings among adults.</p> \n</div> \n</div> \n<p>But <a href=""http://www.pewresearch.org/staff/alec-tyson/"">Alec Tyson</a>, a senior researcher at the Pew Research Center, said that while a growing economy can improve Americans' view of the president, lingering worries about their own outlooks can limit that effect.</p> \n<p>""It's hard for people to rate the president overwhelmingly favorably when they're facing daily struggles,"" he said.</p> \n<h3>The enemy of my enemy is my frenemy — for now</h3> \n<p>No one expects Obama and his Republican adversaries in Congress to start clinking champagne glasses in the East Room anytime soon. But it's harder for Republican leaders to whack him consistently when they find themselves on the same side on headline-grabbing issues. And they've been working with Obama <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/4/23/8473139/not-tea-party-congress"">a lot more</a> in the early months of what the White House calls the ""fourth quarter"" of his presidency.</p> \n<p>Speaker John Boehner pushed White House–backed revisions to the Patriot Act through the House last month, with 196 of the 338 overall votes for the bill (58 percent) coming from Republicans. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell was critical of Obama and the bill — arguing it watered down essential national security protections — but shepherded it through a bumpy ride to enactment all the same. Of the 67 senators who voted for it, 23 were Republicans.</p> \n<p>Obama's biggest legislative push this year is on trade, an issue that unites Republicans and divides Democrats. It's got Paul Ryan, the 2012 Republican vice presidential nominee, praising the president.</p> \n<p>""I think the president on this particular issue is right, and therefore I think this is good for our country, good for the people I represent,"" Ryan, a House member from Wisconsin, told CNN's Dana Bash in <a href=""http://www.cnn.com/2015/06/05/politics/paul-ryan-trade-negotation-barack-obama/"">an interview that aired Friday</a>.</p> \n<h3>Two tracks</h3> \n<p>Obama seems to have found the formula he likes for policymaking: work with lawmakers when he can and go around them when he can't. Executive actions on climate change, immigration, Cuba policy, and the like have shown Democrats that he's willing to flex his muscle on behalf of their priorities. Indeed, there's no shortage of Democratic constituencies lining up for help with executive action right now.</p> \n<p>But the early legislative agenda, including a ""fix"" on Medicare reimbursement rates for doctors, trade deals, and the revision and extension of Patriot Act provisions, has lent itself to bipartisanship. There's little doubt that will break down at some point: Democratic leaders are promising to block all Republican spending bills over the GOP's effort to backfill Obama Pentagon cuts with emergency war-funding money.</p> \n<p>But for now, Obama's still looking to complement his use of executive power with legislative action.</p> \n<p>""He will continue to use each and every tool he has to pursue an aggressive agenda to deliver for working families across the country, both by taking action on his own and by working with Congress in a bipartisan fashion when possible,"" Friedman said.</p> \n<p>Tony Fratto, a Treasury and White House official in President George W. Bush's administration, said working across the aisle could help Obama with the public.</p> \n<p>""I see the president's approval ratings as mostly a function of the economic environment. As the economy improves and is seen as durable, his approval ratings will be bolstered,"" said Fratto, whose firm, Hamilton Place Strategies, is <a href=""http://www.politico.com/politicoinfluence/0115/politicoinfluence16750.html"">advocating for fast-track authority</a> for the president. ""A win on trade, which is  generally popular, can be seen as a bipartisan win, and that would give a  boost. Incidentally, a bipartisan win on trade would boost perceptions  of Congress, too.""</p> \n<h3>The triangulation machine</h3> \n<p>Beyond the allure of bipartisanship, trade has given Obama an opportunity to distance himself a bit from his party's base.</p> \n<p>It's been the centerpiece of an increasingly vitriolic war between Obama and Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren. Warren's status as a heroine of the left naturally makes Obama look more centrist when he fights her, and that may be helpful for him going forward.</p> \n<p>Their first big row was over Antonio Weiss, the Obama treasury undersecretary nominee initially blocked by Warren. She wasn't pleased when Obama did an end-run around her by giving him a political appointment that didn't require Senate confirmation. Then came her criticism of Obama's trade agenda, to which he fired back last month by saying she is <a href=""http://www.cnn.com/2015/05/09/politics/barack-obama-elizabeth-warren-trade/"">""absolutely wrong""</a> on the merits. And just this week, Warren wrote a harsh letter to Obama's Securities and Exchange Commission chief, Mary Jo White, accusing her of leaving a trail of ""broken promises"" in not being a tougher Wall Street overseer.</p> \n<p>If Obama were looking for a way to show he's not beholden to his party's base, he could hardly find a better one than fighting with Warren.</p> \n<h3>Handing over the reins</h3> \n<p>Obama is fond of reminding people that he's not running for president again. It's not a completely liberating epiphany — the desire to protect and nurture his legacy is reason enough not to just follow every whim.</p> \n<p>But it's an important observation in this way: As the 2016 presidential race heats up, Obama will become more of a supporting actor for his party and less its leader. That role will fall to the Democratic nominee for president.</p> \n<p>That should free him from some of the overtly partisan work he's done in past election cycles — particularly from raising money for himself and hitting the stump as a candidate while he's running the country.</p> \n<p>He should benefit from that, too.</p> \n<b>WATCH: President Obama on why he's so polarizing</b> \n<!--  ########  BEGIN VOLUME VIDEO  ########  --> \n<div class=""volume-video"" id=""volume-placement-8857"" data-volume-placement=""article"" data-analytics-placement=""middle"" data-volume-id=""1066"" data-volume-uuid=""bbb092d67"" data-analytics-label=""Obama on why he’s such a polarizing president | 1066"" data-analytics-action=""volume:view:middle"" data-analytics-viewport=""video""></div> \n<!--  ########  END VOLUME VIDEO  ########  -->",Politics
What President Obama really said about his ISIS strategy,http://www.vox.com/2015/6/8/8748043/obama-isis-strategy,"The quotation about the US posture toward ISIS is making its way around the web: ""We don't yet have a complete strategy."" It may be true, but that's not really what President Obama said.","<p>It's been widely reported that President Obama said Monday that he doesn't have a strategy for defeating the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. Some news outlets have <a href=""http://www.politico.com/story/2015/06/obama-no-isil-strategy-118743.html"">played it as a gaffe</a> that reveals Obama's own doubts about his ability to defeat ISIS. And he may well have such doubts — many Americans do. But that's not what he said.</p> \n<p>Here's the headline-ready excerpt from a Monday Q&amp;A session with reporters at the G7 economic summit in Germany that set <a href=""http://www.politico.com/story/2015/06/obama-no-isil-strategy-118743.html"">the Internet atwitter</a>:</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>""We don't yet have a complete strategy""</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Sometimes context is meaningless. This time it's meaningful. So let's hit the instant replay button.</p> \n<p>Obama called on Justin Sink of Bloomberg, who asked:</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>""You said yesterday, ahead of your meeting with Prime Minister Cameron, that you’d assess what was working and what wasn’t,"" Sink said. ""So I’m wondering, bluntly, what is not working in the fight against the Islamic State?""</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>The president, who has stumbled when talking about ISIS in the past, gave a lengthy response that revealed absolutely nothing new.</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>""With respect to ISIL, we have made significant  progress in pushing back ISIL from areas in which they had occupied or  disrupted local populations, but we’ve also seen areas like in Ramadi where they’re displaced in one place and then  they come back in, in another.  And they’re nimble, and they’re  aggressive, and they’re opportunistic.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Obama goes on:</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>So we’re reviewing a range of plans for how we  might do that,  essentially  accelerating the number of Iraqi forces that  are properly  trained and  equipped and have a focused strategy and good leadership.   And when a  finalized plan is  presented to me by the Pentagon, then I  will share it  with the American people.  We don’t yet have a complete  strategy  because it requires commitments on the part of the Iraqis, as  well,  about how recruitment takes place, how that training takes  place. And so  the details of that are not yet worked out.""</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>What Obama said is that there's no full strategy yet for training and equipping Iraqi soldiers because ""it requires commitments on the part of the Iraqis."" That shouldn't come as a surprise, since Obama was meeting on the sidelines of the conference with Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi and the US has been calling for improvements in the Iraqi military.</p> \n<p>It's also different than saying he has no strategy for ISIS. We know the difference because Obama has actually said before, at <a href=""http://www.cnn.com/2014/08/28/world/meast/isis-iraq-syria/"">a September 4 news conference</a>, that he wasn't ready to seek approval from Congress for an ISIS plan because he didn't have one.</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>""I don't want to put the cart before the horse. We don't have a strategy yet.""</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>The language is strikingly similar, but Obama's remarks on Monday were limited to the plan for the Iraqi army. Back in September, the question was whether he had any plan at all to take to Capitol Hill.</p> \n<p>Here's how Sink, the reporter who asked the question, played Obama's response <a href=""http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-06-08/obama-says-u-s-will-keep-ramping-up-assistance-to-iraqis"">in his story</a>:</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>""Obama said the U.S. doesn’t yet 'have a complete strategy' to accelerate recruitment and training of Iraqi forces.""</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Monday's comment, and the one from September, ranks high on the list of politically inept things Obama has said in his tenure as president. But both are still far behind the remark he made in comparing ISIS to a junior varsity sports team in an interview with <a href=""http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/01/27/going-the-distance-2"">the New Yorker's</a> David Remnick that was published in January 2014.</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>""The analogy we use around here sometimes, and I think is accurate, is  if a jayvee team puts on Lakers uniforms that doesn’t make them Kobe Bryant.""</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>There's a reason reporters quickly jumped on the truncated quotation Monday, and it isn't that they're all out to get Obama. It's because they know Obama doesn't yet have a <i>winning</i> strategy for fighting ISIS. It doesn't take a chopped-up quotation to make that point.</p>",Politics
Hillary Clinton's FDR moment,http://www.vox.com/2015/6/9/8749733/Hillary-Clinton-Roosevelt-FDR,Two for the price of one: Hillary Clinton casts herself as an heir to the legacies of Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt.,"<p>When Hillary Rodham Clinton gathers her supporters at Four Freedoms Park on New York's Roosevelt Island for a campaign kickoff rally Saturday, the president she will identify herself with won't be her husband, Bill Clinton, or either of the presidents who appointed her to posts in their administrations, Barack Obama and Jimmy Carter. Instead, she will reach back through the generations to <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2015/02/16/new-ranking-of-u-s-presidents-puts-lincoln-1-obama-18-kennedy-judged-most-over-rated/"">the Democrat who wins the highest marks</a> from political scientists, Franklin Delano Roosevelt.</p> \n<p>It was in January 1941, with Axis powers spreading across the globe, that Roosevelt, clutching the sides of the lectern at the front of the House chamber, enunciated his vision for a ""world founded on <a href=""http://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/fdrthefourfreedoms.htm"">four essential freedoms</a>"" — freedom of speech, freedom of worship, freedom from want, and freedom from fear. He also warned against using America's assistance for its allies as an excuse for sacrificing the very things ""worth fighting for"" at home.</p> \n<p>His list of universal values, which included equality of opportunity, jobs, and a rising standard of living, read like a Democratic platform for the ages — and, for the most part, like the platform Hillary Clinton wants to project to fellow Democrats. On Saturday, Clinton will try to wrap the cloak of FDR’s legacy around her own shoulders.</p> \n<p>""She has long been inspired by FDR's belief that America is stronger when we summon the work and talents of all Americans,"" Kristina Schake, Clinton's deputy communications director, said. ""Her fight, like his, is to work to ensure that everyday Americans can achieve not just a sense of economic stability, but prosperity.""</p> \n<p>It promises to be a moment replete with symbolism for a candidate who is trying to show that, like Roosevelt, she can be a crusader for common men, women, and children despite her enormous personal wealth; who sees America's strength at home as an essential component of its ability to lead abroad; and who is half of one of American history’s great power couples.</p> \n<p>If Clinton breaks the glass ceiling of the presidency, she'll be standing on the shoulders of two Roosevelts, Franklin and Eleanor.</p> \n<p>As a first lady who became a force on public policy in her own right, Clinton has often said she identifies with Eleanor Roosevelt, who advised her husband in office, drove the adoption of the UN's Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and pushed for black civil rights. Now, Clinton is signaling that Franklin Roosevelt is the model for the type of president she wants to be: progressive at home, muscular abroad.</p> \n<p> </p> \n<blockquote lang=""en"" class=""twitter-tweet""> \n<p lang=""en"" dir=""ltr"">Four Freedoms Park has a familiar arrow shape.... <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/HillaryClinton?src=hash"">#HillaryClinton</a> <a href=""http://t.co/3V0MrAYf91"">pic.twitter.com/3V0MrAYf91</a></p> \n— Jim Kennedy (@jimkennedy250) <a href=""https://twitter.com/jimkennedy250/status/605409935921442816"">June 1, 2015</a>\n</blockquote> \n<p><br> \n<script src=""//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"" charset=""utf-8""></script> \n</p> \n<p> </p> \n<p>""What she is doing by going to that park, she’s identifying with the values of FDR.

""This might be the moment for Hillary to preempt anyone to her left.""</p> \n<h3>""She's a big-government person""</h3> \n<p>In the two months since she launched her campaign, Clinton has courted liberal constituencies with promises to end the ""era of mass incarceration,"" enhance Obama's executive action on immigration, and expand voting rights. It's all part of a strategy based on calculations that she'll need to energize Democratic activists to win in swing  states and that she can <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/5/8/8574707/Hillary-Clinton-strategy-left"">rally them without alienating independents</a>.</p> \n<p>Still, a small set of influential progressives, most notably Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, have refused to endorse Clinton as they try to push her to the left. Last month, Warren and de Blasio joined with Roosevelt Institute chief economist <a href=""http://www.josephstiglitz.com/"">Joseph Stiglitz</a> for the unveiling of his 115-page blueprint for ""rewriting the rules"" of the American economy to close income and wealth gaps.</p> \n<p>Stiglitz is advising Clinton on economic policy, and her aides have met repeatedly with Roosevelt Institute scholars and staff, including at least one session since the release of the report, according to a person familiar with the discussions. Clinton isn't likely to detail a New Deal for the 21st century during her speech on Saturday. Senior campaign officials said she will roll out specific policies over the summer, and it seems unlikely, at a time of deficits and mounting debt, that Clinton would propose anything nearing the scope of Roosevelt's domestic agenda. But there can be little question that she is looking for ways to link her campaign to ideas and policies grounded in the values of the Roosevelt era.</p> \n<p>It’s been a long time since a Democratic presidential candidate pushed the FDR parallel. When he was running for president, Obama praised Ronald Reagan as a visionary and used endorsements by Ted Kennedy and Caroline Kennedy to cast himself as an heir to Camelot. Similarly, in 1992, Bill Clinton, far younger than his rival, President George H. W. Bush, emphasized his connection to President Kennedy, most memorably through a photograph of a young Clinton meeting JFK.</p> \n<p>They both ran at a time when Roosevelt’s government-centered progressivism was in retreat. And there's some risk for Clinton if she gets too far out in front of voters' appetite for solutions that come from government.</p> \n<p>Grover Norquist, president of Americans for Tax Reform, which advocates for smaller government and lower taxes, said it is politically savvy for Clinton to connect with Roosevelt's New Deal, rather than President Lyndon Johnson's Great Society, because ""the New Deal was seen as pro-middle class in a way that the Great Society was seen as welfare.""</p> \n<p>But, he said, there should be no confusion about Clinton's view of government's role in society.</p> \n<p>""Hillary is a statist. There isn't any place, including the Iraq War, that she doesn't want more government,"" he said. ""She's a big-government person.""</p> \n<h3>Wait and see</h3> \n<p>Forgive progressives who remain skeptical of Clinton's embrace of Roosevelt. After all, it was Bill Clinton who used his own <a href=""http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=53091"">1996 State of the Union address</a> — 55 years after Roosevelt's ""Four Freedoms"" speech — to declare, ""The era of big government is over."" More recently, Obama rejected <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/10/opinion/10krugman.html?_r=0"">calls from progressives</a> to use the financial crisis as the justification for a second New Deal.</p> \n<p>Former Congressman Brad Miller, a senior fellow at the <a href=""http://www.rooseveltinstitute.org/"">Roosevelt Institute</a> who was a leading liberal voice on the Dodd-Frank overhaul of the financial regulatory system, said Clinton's effort to cast herself in the mold of Roosevelt is encouraging but not enough to convince progressives who have been disappointed before.</p> \n<p>""It puts her and the Democratic Party in touch with our historic mission, our historic position of being the champion of everyday Americans,"" Miller said. ""Part of the problem on the left, including me, [is] we have many times talked to policymakers who have said, 'We are with you 100 percent,' and then not done it.""</p> \n<h3>The ties that bind?</h3> \n<p>Both Republicans and progressive Democrats have said Clinton will have difficulty presenting herself as a champion for the have-nots because of her wealth and her close personal, political, and financial ties to the nation's elite. That was an effective knock on the last two Republican presidential nominees, Mitt Romney and John McCain, the former of whom was building a car elevator at one home and the latter of whom couldn't say how many houses (eight) he owned at the time.</p> \n<p>Together, the Clintons pulled down $25 million in paid speeches over a 16-month period ending in April, according to a personal financial disclosure Hillary Clinton filed in May. Much of the money came from companies that have business before the federal government, including some that lobbied the State Department when she was secretary. And even as she runs as a campaign-finance reformer, Clinton's fundraising calendar reads like a who's who of the well-heeled and politically connected.</p> \n<p>Her Republican adversaries say she's a hypocrite on income inequality. Sanders has said Clinton's wealth is <a href=""http://www.cnn.com/2015/05/19/politics/bernie-sanders-hillary-clinton-wealth-a-problem/"">""a problem.""</a> And Washington Post columnist <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/hillary-clintons-guilt-by-association/2015/06/04/bd836dc4-0b13-11e5-a7ad-b430fc1d3f5c_story.html"">Dana Milbank wrote</a> that the optics are bad for Clinton.</p> \n<p> </p> \n<aside><q>""Clinton can talk all she wants about income inequality and reducing the  influence of money in politics, but her recent experience makes her seem insincere""</q></aside> \n<p> </p> \n<p>That's why the reach for Roosevelt is so important to the narrative of her campaign, said two Clinton advisers who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss strategy. Roosevelt was wealthy, but he created programs that employed Americans by the thousands during the Great Depression, enacted Social Security, regulated the financial sector, backed labor in its push for stronger workplace standards, pressed corporations to spend on the war effort, and accelerated desegregation through an executive order banning the federal government and its contractors from discriminating in the hiring of defense workers. Clinton advisers say the comparisons to Romney and McCain fall short because her policy preferences aren't designed to help the rich.</p> \n<p>Still, many Democrats worry about Clinton's affinity for Wall Street banks and major US corporations. As secretary of state, she was an <a href=""http://www.bloomberg.com/bw/articles/2013-01-10/hillary-clintons-business-legacy-at-the-state-department"">unapologetic advocate for</a>, and promoter of, American businesses abroad. Her husband's support of the North American Free Trade Agreement still sticks in the craw of organized labor, and many progressives are anxiously waiting to hear whether she will endorse or reject the <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/trans-pacific-partnership"">Trans-Pacific Partnership</a> deal that she helped advance as a member of Obama's Cabinet and which they argue will kill jobs in the US.</p> \n<p>Clinton sidled up to labor when she called in to a conference of fast-food workers on Saturday, which could indicate that she wants to support unions or that she is about to disappoint them.</p> \n<p>""All of you should not have to march in the streets to get a living wage, but thank you for marching in the streets to get that living wage,"" she told them. ""We need you out there leading the fight against those who would rip away Americans' right to organize, to collective bargaining, to fair pay.""</p> \n<h3>The Eleanor thread</h3> \n<p>Allida Black was sitting in a coffee shop when she received an email informing her that Clinton would hold her kickoff rally at Four Freedoms Park.</p> \n<p>""I just stood up and did a whoop and shot my fist in the air,"" said Black, a co-founder of the now-defunct Ready for Hillary Super PAC who was editor of the <a href=""http://books.upress.virginia.edu/title/4235"">Eleanor Roosevelt Papers</a> and has written educational materials for the park. ""It’s perfect.""</p> \n<p>When Clinton arrived in the White House in 1993, Eleanor Roosevelt was the only example of a first lady who had become a political figure in her own right after working as a publicly visible partner in her husband's presidency. Clinton kept a portrait of Eleanor Roosevelt in her White House office, which helped her when she was ""looking for comfort"" during trying times.</p> \n<p>""The example she set as a fearless first lady and a courageous fighter for human rights inspired and fortified me,"" Clinton wrote in <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Hard-Choices-Hillary-Rodham-Clinton/dp/1476751471""><i>Hard Choices</i></a>.</p> \n<p>On a policy level, the strongest thread connecting Eleanor Roosevelt and Hillary Clinton is a shared commitment to global human rights. After her husband's death, Eleanor Roosevelt led the drafting committee for the UN's <a href=""http://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/"">Universal Declaration of Human Rights</a>, which is striking in its adoption of many of the tenets of the US Constitution and many of the values Franklin Roosevelt sought to promote. Clinton emphasized human rights both as first lady and as secretary of state, most famously in bookend speeches in 1995 and 2011 that equated <a href=""http://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/hillaryclintonbeijingspeech.htm"">women's rights</a> and <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/post/clintons-geneva-accord-gay-rights-are-human-rights/2011/03/04/gIQAPUipcO_blog.html"">LGBT rights </a>with human rights.</p> \n<p>The two women also are bound by the vitriol they inspired in their adversaries. Eleanor Roosevelt has one of the largest files on record with the FBI, which tracked her supposed connections to communism, and for nearly a quarter of a century Clinton has been the favorite target of Republican politicians and talk radio hosts.</p> \n<p>""There is no one who understands the courage Eleanor had, the determination she had, and the intense flak she got for her vision better than Hillary,"" Black said.</p> \n<h3>The hawk they love</h3> \n<p>For two generations, the Democratic base has been reflexively wary of war. That's the legacy of two wars of choice: Vietnam and Iraq. Johnson's pursuit of the war in Vietnam turned liberal Democrats so hard against him that he chose not to seek reelection in 1968. Clinton's support of the Iraq War provided Obama the opening he needed for a real contrast and paved the way for his victory in the 2008 Democratic presidential primary.</p> \n<p>While she may be moving left on domestic policy, Clinton has shown no signs of backing off her longstanding support for using the threat of force — and actual force — as a major tool of foreign policy. If she can credibly cast that worldview in the shadow of Roosevelt's call for the defense of the Four Freedoms — rather than in the more haphazard frames of Vietnam and Iraq — she'll have done herself an invaluable favor in appealing not just to Democratic voters but also, perhaps, to the <a href=""http://www.gallup.com/poll/168083/seniors-realigned-republican-party.aspx"">Republican-tilting voters</a> who remember the Greatest Generation.</p> \n<p>Roosevelt, who led the nation into World War II, was no dove.</p> \n<p>He saw a powerful connection between America's strength at home and its position as a global leader. He said as much at the conclusion of his 1944 State of the Union address, when he outlined a proposed ""Second Bill of Rights"" that would, among other things, guarantee housing, health care, and education to Americans regardless of race.</p> \n<p>""America’s own rightful place in the world depends in large part upon how fully      these and similar rights have been carried into practice for our citizens,"" Roosevelt said. ""For unless there is security here at home there cannot be lasting peace in the world.""</p> \n<p>Clinton has echoed that sentiment.</p> \n<p>""We have to continue to advance American values, which correspond with universal values. I'm always reminding my counterparts  that when I talk about freedom of expression, freedom of religion, those are not just American values. The world agreed to those values back in the declaration, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,"" she said in a speech to the Council on Foreign Relations just before stepping down as secretary of state. ""We're going to stand up for them. And it's not always easy, and we have to pick our times. We can't be  shortsighted or counterproductive, but we're going to continue to stand up for them.""</p> \n<h3>""The fight within them""</h3> \n<p>In the early stages of her campaign, Clinton has sought to convey to voters that she is fighting for them, not for herself. She has said she wants to be a champion for ""everyday Americans.""</p> \n<p>Kaye, the University of Wisconsin Green Bay professor who wrote <i>The Fight for the Four Freedoms</i>, said Roosevelt's strength was in inspiring others as much as in taking up their causes. Clinton's ability to do that, he said, will be the measure of whether she can live up to Roosevelt.</p> \n<p>""Is she prepared not only to talk about what she will do for us, but to mobilize Americans and encourage the fight within them?"" he asked.</p>",Politics

I’ve done my homework and I agree with him.""</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>That didn't sit well with labor, which had threatened to withhold support for Democrats who back the president's trade agenda. Running ads against politically vulnerable Democrats goes a step further into political hardball territory. Bill Samuels, head of government affairs for the AFL-CIO, explained that Rice's flip-flop is a graver sin in the eyes of labor than just backing Obama.</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>""Our members are very angry and they expect us to hold these members publicly accountable.""</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>The Rice ad doesn't pull any punches.</p> \n<p><iframe width=""560"" height=""315"" frameborder=""0"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/CU8-Dw1FPqE""></iframe></p> \n<p>The ad is particularly punishing because its tagline ""Why should we ever trust Kathleen Rice again?"" is the kind of message that could dovetail with future Republican attacks against the lawmaker. The issue of trust, rather than trade, can be used by the GOP.</p> \n<p>A recent ad the AFL-CIO ran against Democratic Rep. Ami Bera, whose district is even more competitive than Rice's, was more focused on trade, which most Republicans support.</p> \n<p><iframe width=""560"" height=""315"" frameborder=""0"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/Tq5_1UlDi3A""></iframe></p> \n<p>Rice spokesperson Eric Phillips said the AFL-CIO is wasting its money and could damage its broader agenda by helping Republicans.</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>""I wouldn't want  to be a labor leader and have to explain to my hardworking nurses or truck drivers or tradesmen why we're wasting hundreds of thousands of  their families' dollars attacking a progressive Democrat who's with them on nearly every issue but this bill. And I certainly wouldn't want to have to explain to those workers that if their money is successful, they'll get a staunch anti-union representative as their reward.""</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Perhaps jeopardizing Democratic House seats is worth the risk to labor's overall agenda if unions are able to defeat this trade bill. But with very few Republicans aligned with unions in Congress — and many Republicans trying to crack down on labor rights across the country — burning allies at the altar of a single trade pact may be shortsighted.

Adam Smith’s vote on trade, it could be for the simplest of all reasons: no one asked for it.</p> \n<p>On Tuesday morning, the lanky, balding Washington Democrat was identified by The Hill, a newspaper for congressional insiders, as <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://thehill.com/policy/finance/trade/244370-top-10-members-to-watch-on-trade"">one of the 10 lawmakers to watch</a> when the House votes on fast-track trade authority for President Obama.</p> \n<p>That’s because Smith, a free-trader at times in the past, has watched his district grown more heavily Democratic through redistricting. He has concerns about the Trans-Pacific Partnership — the deal that would be set in motion if Congress agrees to fast-track power — including its funding level for federal subsidies to retrain workers affected by trade.</p> \n<p>He’s an obvious target for a White House eager to scrounge up the last votes for fast-track authority, which Republican officials say is likely to be on the House floor by the end of this week. And yet Smith said in a brief interview that the Obama team isn’t knocking down his door.</p> \n<p>""As of this hour, nobody from the White House has called me and directly asked me to vote for it,"" he said as he walked through the lobby outside the House chamber Tuesday evening.</p> \n<p>That’s not to say the administration lost his number. <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://twitter.com/laborsec"">Labor Secretary Tom Perez</a> spoke with him last week about worker-protection provisions in the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement, and David Simas, the White House political director, called several weeks ago to talk trade.</p> \n<p>Smith didn’t seem upset by the lack of contact — some lawmakers would prefer not to be cajoled or browbeaten over their votes — but it’s hard to understand why the White House whip list wouldn’t include a lawmaker who says he’s genuinely undecided at this point.</p> \n<p>So far, Obama’s main tactic has been to tell Democrats that he’ll provide them political cover if they vote with him on trade. That is, if labor unions and progressive voters come after them in their next election, he’ll vouch for them. He’s even got a rewards program: a trip on Air Force One.</p> \n<p>Virginia Rep. Gerry Connolly said riding with Obama on a trip to Germany earlier this week was a ""very visible symbol of that commitment.""</p> \n<p>Maybe just a call from the president or a top aide would sway Smith, maybe not. It’s surprising that he hasn’t been pleaded with or pushed. A White House official told Vox they would look into it, but didn’t return with an explanation.</p> \n<p>Maybe, Smith ventured, the White House assumes he’s on board because he has backed some past trade agreements, including those with South Korea, Colombia, and Panama. Asked whether that was a good assumption, he offered a one-word response: ""No.""</p> \n<p><i>UPDATE:</i> An administration official e-mails with this</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p><span>While  I don’t have any individual calls or meetings to readout to you at the  moment, the President has spoken regularly with members of Congress,  including members  of both parties and leadership as well as rank-and-file members, to  discuss TPA and TPP. In conjunction with direct engagement from the  President, his cabinet has been out there making the case for why these  trade deals will benefit a wide range of American  workers and businesses, including more than 130 trade-related events in  at least 35 states.  Events have taken a number of forms, including  roundtables with Members, business leaders, and/or stakeholders;  meetings with CEOs, trade associations, and small businesses;  and site visits to companies that export and otherwise benefit from  trade. In addition, USTR has held over 1,700 briefings with members on  trade since the beginning of the administration. </span></p> \n</blockquote>",Politics

I kid. I haven't met Tim, but all evidence points to him being a mensch. And I don't want to turn Vox into an internal debate society. But I do want to weigh in once more, since I don't think I was entirely clear the first time around. Tim seems to think I was characterizing all fiscal conservatives as jerks, or saying that fiscal conservatism is de facto evidence of jerkdom. That was not my intent.</p> \n<p>Rather, the argument is that being rich in America seems to make people jerks in a very particular way, and fiscal conservatism is one of the ways that particular form of jerkdom expresses itself. It's not the only way to get to fiscal conservatism, but it's the way that many rich people do.</p> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""3812922"" alt=""rich-evolution.0.jpg"" src=""https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3812922/rich-evolution.0.jpg""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Pictorial representation of man slowly coming to see the wisdom of low marginal tax rates on high earners. (Shutterstock)</p> \n<h3>Utilitarianism and trying not to be a jerk</h3> \n<p>Let me back up a bit.</p> \n<p>I'm a consequentialist, which means, broadly speaking, that I believe the morality of our actions is measured by their consequences. More specifically, I'm a utilitarian, which means I think public policy (and individual behavior) ought to aim to produce the most welfare. Even more specifically, I identify as some form of <a href=""https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Rule_utilitarianism"">rule utilitarian</a>. Whereas an act utilitarian believes each individual action should be calculated to maximize welfare, a rule utilitarian thinks we ought to adopt the principles, guidelines, and policies that maximize long-term welfare. (Obeying such rules will, in some individual cases, mean sacrificing some short-term welfare.)</p> \n<p>The philosophical details aren't all that important. I just want to identify three implications of utilitarianism that are relevant to this discussion.</p> \n<p>First, any kind of consequentialism, but especially utilitarianism, implies a commitment to empiricism. The only way to discover what produces the most welfare is to <i>pay attention to the facts</i>. So Tim is entirely right about, say, the minimum wage. There is obviously such thing as a too-high minimum wage. The right minimum wage is the one that maximizes welfare; the way to find out what it is is to pay serious attention to research and historical experience.</p> \n<p>Second, utilitarianism imposes, or ought to impose, a kind of cognitive and psychological self-discipline. Anyone who has studied human psychology — or, y'know, met a human — knows that we are masters of self-deception, highly prone to <a href=""https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Motivated_reasoning"">motivated reasoning</a>. Our natural mode of inquiry is to seek out facts that confirm our tribal biases and worldviews. But if we really want to maximize welfare, we have to fight this tendency; we have to strive to see the evidence clearly and guard against <a href=""http://www.sciencedaily.com/terms/confirmation_bias.htm"">confirmation bias</a> (as Tim says).</p> \n<p>Third, utilitarianism runs contrary to human nature, more so the stricter it gets. Humans are wired to have circles of concern, starting with the self and moving outward to family and tribe. (There are always multiple overlapping tribes: extended family, city, state, nation, ethnicity, shared interests, shared ideology, etc.) The farther out the circle goes — the global poor, all humanity, future generations, life on Earth, <i>the cosmos</i> — the more abstract, intellectual, and tenuous the concern becomes. To really conceive of the interests of people far away in time or space, we have to reason our way there, using our frontal cortex. We don't feel the pull of those far-off interests in a visceral way, unlike the interests of our own bodies, families, and people. The smaller the circle of concern, the more directly it engages our lizard brains, and the more we <i>feel</i> it.</p> \n<p>When humans feel anxious, afraid, or angry, the frontal cortex gets quieter and the lizard brain gets louder; our circles of concern constrict, and we become more ""in-group conscious."" The function of morality, as I take it, is to act as a countervailing force, to push our circles of concern outward, to give us a framework and heuristics that help tack against our natural parochialism.</p> \n<p>No one is perfect at this; no one is, in practice, <i>really</i> as concerned about a Bangladeshi farmer as they are about their neighbor (unless they happen to be the Bangladeshi farmer's neighbor). Everyone favors his or her own tribe in a pinch. We are all saddled with some combination of nature and nurture that shapes our instincts, making those expanded circles of concern easier for some than others. And some people face circumstances — poverty, stress, insecurity — that make looking beyond the bottom rungs of <a href=""https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs"">Maslow's hierarchy</a> difficult to do at all.</p> \n<p>But being a good person means trying, making an effort to increase the net amount of love and decency in the world, to see the evidence clearly, to be wary of our biases, to take into account others far away in space or time. We should all have compassion for one another when we fall short. But we should all try. To not try is to be a jerk.</p> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""3812932"" alt=""rich-f-u.0.jpg"" src=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3812932/rich-f-u.0.jpg""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Not making much of an effort. (Shutterstock)</p> \n<h3>Jerkish and non-jerkish reasons to support small government</h3> \n<p>So let's bring it back to the discussion at hand. As a consequentialist, I have no a priori preferences regarding the size of government. I support whatever level of taxation, spending, and regulation produces the most welfare. That's why I am, in the context of contemporary American politics, a liberal. This is something Jonathan Chait has <a href=""http://www.newrepublic.com/article/politics/fact-finders"">written about</a>:</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>Liberalism ... claims to produce certain outcomes: more prosperity and security, especially for the poor and middle classes; a cleaner environment; safer foods and drugs; and so on. If it were proved beyond a doubt that liberal policies fail to produce those outcomes—or even, as conservatives often claim, that such policies hurt their intended beneficiaries—then their rationale would disappear. It may be hard to imagine liberals advocating capital gains tax cuts as a way to lift up the working stiff. But that's just because there's no evidence to show they do. If the evidence were to change, so would the liberal mindset. The point is that liberalism has no justification other than the belief that liberal policies produce beneficial outcomes.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Liberalism is, in short, empiricist and consequentialist. At least mine is, and Chait's. (In a <a href=""http://www.willwilkinson.net/whatever/2005/02/22/jonathan-chait-confirmation-bias-in-one-satirical-lesson/"">blistering reply</a> to Chait, libertarian Will Wilkinson claimed that empiricism is actually extremely rare on both sides, and no more common on the left than on the right. I agree that self-disciplined empiricism is rare, but it's simply not true that rigidity and dogmatism are evenly distributed in US politics today. The right has more.)</p> \n<p>Now, <i>some</i> people arrive at fiscal conservatism through consequentialist reasoning. They ""sincerely believe that high taxes on the wealthy shrink the economic pie, making everyone worse off in the long run,"" as Tim says — a straightforwardly utilitarian argument.</p> \n<p>I happen to think it's wrong. Obviously there is some level of taxes that produces net negative effects. Similarly, there are some regulations that do more harm than good and some spending programs that are wasteful or misguided. As an empirically minded utilitarian I oppose those particular tax levels, regulations, and programs. But I think the evidence shows pretty clearly that, in our current circumstances, taxes are well short of that point and the regulations (Clean Air Act, Dodd-Frank) and spending programs (Social Security, Medicaid) targeted by conservatives produce far, far more welfare than they cost economically. Other developed democracies demonstrate that it is possible to have better health and welfare outcomes than the US while still sustaining robust economic growth.</p> \n<p>I think the evidence on this is so clear that I have trouble crediting consequentialist reasoning that concludes otherwise. Still, I accept that such reasoning exists, is sincere, and is not jerky in and of itself.</p> \n<p>However! Evidence indicates that very few real-life fiscal conservatives are motivated primarily by utilitarian convictions. Chait quotes Milton Friedman saying ""economic freedom is an end in itself"" — not a means to positive outcomes, but an end in itself. Libertarian patron saint Ayn Rand was very, very clear that an individual owes no obligations to others beyond those explicitly, contractually agreed upon; obligation to the common good, in her worldview, literally makes no sense. And legendary conservative Margaret Thatcher said, ""There's no such thing as society. There are individual men and women, and there are families.""</p> \n<p>These are explicitly deontological, anti-utilitarian arguments. The rights of the individual, including ""economic freedom,"" are sacrosanct, no matter the consequences. This view makes small, unobtrusive government an intrinsic good — not good because it's better for more people, but good because it respects the individual's right to keep what they produce. Conservatives can and do often make empirical arguments about the superiority of small-government outcomes, but mainly to convince those who don't share their first principles. It's the principles that matter.</p> \n<h3>Rich people prefer the jerkish variety</h3> \n<p>And here's the thing. If you are a rich person, a person who has benefited enormously from the status quo, and are offered an ideology that serves to justify your good fortune, an ideology that tells you you deserve everything you have, that the poor deserve less because they don't work as hard and aren't as smart, that extreme income inequality reflects merit, that trying to help other people actually does them harm ...</p> \n<p>Well, that's awfully convenient. It seems to me if you find yourself blessed with power and money, in a position to have enormous effects on other people's lives, you have a special obligation to interrogate your own priors, to be <i>suspicious</i> of an ideology that so neatly overlaps with your self-interest. It seems to me, if you are comfortably insulated from risk, you ought to be very, very careful about supporting policies that put other, more vulnerable people at greater risk. You ought to be damn sure you have good reasons, that you haven't just fallen for a self-justifying fairy tale.</p> \n<p>But rich people in the US, by and large, don't seem to interrogate their priors at all. If anything, getting rich (or being born into wealth) seems to have the opposite effect. It primes them to accept self-justifying ideology and surrounds them with people who share that ideology. They come to believe not just that they can get away with jerky behavior, but that jerky behavior is their right. As science journalist Maia Szalavitz <a href=""http://healthland.time.com/2012/02/28/why-the-rich-are-less-ethical-they-see-greed-as-good/"">put it</a>, summarizing several studies, ""Rich people tended to take advantage of others primarily because they saw selfish and greedy behavior as acceptable, not just because they had more money or higher social status.""</p> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""3812954"" alt=""rich-cigar.0.jpg"" src=""https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3812954/rich-cigar.0.jpg""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">""Why do I mistreat the peons? Because I can, darling. Because I can."" (Shutterstock)</p> \n<p>The rich are showered with privileges and come to believe that those privileges are their just deserts, that those who don't share the privileges don't deserve them. They minimize or dismiss the role of luck in life outcomes. They develop <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2015/01/08/most-of-americas-rich-think-the-poor-have-it-easy/"">horrifying views</a> about the lazy, shiftless, undeserving poor, the <a href=""http://www.usnews.com/debate-club/did-the-47-percent-video-sink-romneys-campaign"">47 percent</a> of the country that's all moochers and takers who vote Democrat because they want Obama phones and food-stamp steaks. They come to see themselves as heroes, job creators, makers beset on all sides by the envious and less gifted, a beleaguered, victimized class.</p> \n<p>They don't interrogate conservative ideology at all. They lap it up, wallow in it. They use their enormous wealth and political influence to advocate for slashing assistance to the poor, reducing their own taxes, weakening or repealing successful public-health regulations, and keeping money supply tight even in the face of a sluggish recovery and the zero lower bound. And they show an astonishing lack of self-awareness about any of it.</p> \n<p>Tim and his smart, urbane DC libertarian friends might not come to their fiscal conservatism via toxic, myopic, self-justifying myths. But the American rich sure seem to. They are not jerks because they are fiscal conservatives; they are fiscal conservatives because, as a great deal of other evidence demonstrates, they are jerks.</p>",Politics

"No, the American Revolution was not a mistake",http://www.vox.com/2015/7/7/8908481/american-revolution-mistake,Dylan Matthews thinks slaves and American Indians would've been better off had the US never declared independence. He's wrong.,"<p>The <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/7/2/8884885/american-revolution-mistake"">American Revolution ""was a mistake,""</a> Dylan Matthews argued last week. He lists three reasons that, in his telling, millions of American Indians and black Americans would've been better off had the Founding Fathers never declared independence:</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>Slavery would've been abolished earlier, American Indians would've faced rampant persecution but not the outright ethnic cleansing Andrew Jackson and other American leaders perpetrated, and America would have a parliamentary system of government that makes policymaking easier and lessens the risk of democratic collapse.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>It's a thought-provoking argument — and an understandable reaction to centuries of brutal racial oppression and, more recently, generations of historians who've sought to excuse slaveholding Founding Fathers.</p> \n<p>But Matthews's alternate history is not really correct. Had the American Colonies remained part of the British Empire, slavery would have almost certainly persisted just as long as it did. Slavery might've actually gone on a bit longer, particularly for Northern slaves who were emancipated long before the Civil War.</p> \n<p>As for the treatment of American Indians, it's a bit tougher to say. But if you look north to Canada, which followed the example Matthews says the US should have and remained loyal to the crown, there's little reason to think that native communities would have fared substantially better had the revolution never occurred. (On his final point, I'll leave it to legislative procedure enthusiasts to debate whether the US would be better off with a British-style parliament.)</p> \n<p>But it's not just that Matthews's counterfactual is wrong. It's that he misses one of the most important facts about the American Revolution: that it was the greatest force for emancipation in the US until the Civil War.</p> \n<h3>1) American Indians would probably not have been better off if the revolution hadn't happened</h3> \n<p>One of the arguments against the revolution is that American Indians would've been better off had it never happened. And maybe so — it's certainly difficult to imagine they could have been any worse off than they were under the United States. Could the genocide of American Indians have been mitigated had the Colonies remained under British control?</p> \n<p>This is perhaps where Matthews's counterfactual is on its safest ground. He points to British Canada, which he correctly notes did not pursue a policy against native communities ""as violent and deadly"" as that pursued by the independent United States.</p> \n<p>And the colonists, he writes, were frustrated by the British Empire's strict limits on westward expansion. Breaking free of the empire meant breaking free of those limits, and thus taking more land that belonged to American Indians.</p> \n<p>But I suspect Matthews may be conflating the American Revolution with deeper currents in American history. It's not so clear that it was independence specifically that enabled and led to the genocide against American Indians. Rather, other factors — distinct ideologies, demographics, and climates — likely played just as large of a role, if not larger. It's just not clear that the absence of independence would have saved the American Indians.</p> \n<p>Look at Australia: Controlled by the British until the 20th century, that country saw its aboriginal populations <a href=""https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/1999/09/geno-s07.html"">suffer</a> a <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/tim-giago/american-indians-and-aust_b_479437.html"">similarly horrific</a> annihilation as the American Indians. And it's not as if, as Matthews himself notes, the <a href=""http://www.tolerance.cz/courses/papers/hutchin.htm"">natives</a> <a href=""http://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-debate/what-canada-committed-against-first-nations-was-genocide-the-un-should-recognize-it/article14853747/"">of</a> <a href=""http://thinkprogress.org/world/2015/06/05/3666481/aboriginal-canada/"">Canada</a> were treated with kindness.</p> \n<h3>2) Without the revolution, the North might not have freed its slaves</h3> \n<p>When the Revolution began in 1776, slavery was legal in every colony. Only Pennsylvania even had an abolition society. Slavery had existed on American soil for two centuries without being substantially challenged by whites.</p> \n<p>The American Revolution changed that. Pennsylvania’s <a href=""http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/pennst01.asp"">emancipation</a> act of 1780, the first of its kind, was written by revolutionary leaders and explicitly cites the fight against British rule as its inspiration. Similar Northern emancipation acts followed: in Massachusetts and New Hampshire in 1783, and then in Connecticut and Rhode Island the next year.</p> \n<p>""Politicians, preachers, and propagandists unfurled the rhetoric of natural rights,"" Paul J. Polgar, a historian at the College of William &amp; Mary, <a href=""http://search.proquest.com/openview/234da9c249c3ab2cfb56a3bb2f763331/1?pq-origsite=gscholar"">wrote in a 2011 essay</a> for the <i>Journal of the Early Republic</i>, ""and the immediate post-Revolutionary period witnessed the emergence of abolition societies as far south as Virginia.""</p> \n<p>Mary Beth Norton, a professor in Cornell’s history department, told me in an email that this is what Matthews's alternate history misses: Without the revolution, these movements might not have come to the North as quickly as they did.</p> \n<p>""By focusing only on slavery in the South, Matthews completely ignores the fact that slavery was legal in every colony, and that the Revolution led directly to the abolition of slavery in the northern United States,"" she wrote.</p> \n<p>It is true that even the Northern patriots placed the interests of white America ahead of African-Americans. But the ideals they articulated gave abolition a moral urgency that survived long after General Charles Cornwallis surrendered at the Battle of Yorktown. Without the American Revolution, that might not have happened, and slavery in the North would have likely persisted longer.</p> \n<h3>3) Many black soldiers fought for independence because they saw it as their best path to freedom</h3> \n<p>Matthews makes much of the Earl of Dunmore’s proclamation that promised freedom to slaves who fought for the British, which led many slaves to see loyalty to the crown as offering ""far greater prospects for freedom.""</p> \n<p>But this is really only half of the story — a number of slaves and former slaves also sided with the revolution.</p> \n<p>""The best way to look at blacks' aims in the revolution is to focus on their search for freedom from bondage. Sometimes that led them to fight for the British, and sometimes for the Americans,"" writes Norton, the Cornell professor.</p> \n<p>Norton notes that the story of blacks in the revolution is not complete without the accounts of former slaves like Bristol Mabee, who identified in the idealism of the founders — rather than the far-off British Empire — the best hope for black emancipation.</p> \n<p>More than 5,000 African Americans <a href=""http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CRPT-112srpt118/pdf/CRPT-112srpt118.pdf"">fought</a> in the Continental Army and Navy; the original heroes of<a href=""http://articles.philly.com/1996-02-18/news/25658498_1_black-soldiers-black-men-encampment""> the Boston Massacre, Valley Forge</a>, and <a href=""http://www.celebrateboston.com/biography/salem-poor.htm"">Bunker Hill</a> included black Americans and former slaves.</p> \n<p>The fact that so many saw the revolution as their best path to freedom doesn't necessarily mean that they were right to do so, but it cuts against the idea that the revolution was inherently bad for black Americans and slaves; if that were true, they wouldn't have sided with it.</p> \n<h3>4) The South probably would have still fought for slavery — and may not have had to</h3> \n<p>A big part of Matthews's counterfactual is his argument that had the Colonies remained part of the British Empire, then the British emancipation of 1834 would've freed the American slaves. That would mean ending slavery a generation earlier, and without a bloody civil war.</p> \n<p>And the South, he says, wouldn't be able to stop it: The ""South’s political influence within the British Empire would have been vastly smaller than its influence in the early American Republic,"" in large part since it was ""simply smaller as a chunk of the British Empire’s economy at the time than it was as a portion of America’s.""</p> \n<p>This sounds great, but it's probably too optimistic. The Southern states' lack of political influence is exactly what led them to secede in 1860 and 1861. If the order to emancipate the slaves had been decreed by a British imperial government an ocean away, it's very hard to imagine the South accepting that.</p> \n<p>Would the 19th century British Empire really have forced emancipation on the South, even at the risk of war? Keep in mind that the empire did not exactly have a glowing track record of going to war in the name of morals:</p> \n<ul> \n<li>The British abandoned the American slaves who fought on their side in the Revolution.</li> \n<li>The British Empire benefited directly from the cotton produced by the American slaves for decades after the revolution, and did so without protest. </li> \n<li>When the Civil War did come, the British were at best neutral, choosing convenience over any professed ideals. </li> \n</ul> \n<p>Looking at these facts, it's difficult to imagine that the South would have obeyed a British order of emancipation, or possibly even that the British would have necessarily been willing to fight a major war to enforce it.</p> \n<h3>5) The American Revolution inspired other independence and emancipation movements</h3> \n<p>Cornell history professor Isaac Kramnick pointed out, in an email to me, ""another possible consequence had the Americans not rebelled from Britain: there might still be the brutally exploitative English colonial system.""</p> \n<p>The ideas articulated by the American founders resurface in wave after wave of popular movements, black and white: in France, Haiti, Spain, and Latin America.</p> \n<p>""Many of the leaders of independence movements against the British Empire after World War ll cited Jefferson and the American Revolution as their inspirational model,"" Kramnick wrote.</p> \n<p>With the benefit of hindsight, the rhetoric of 1776 looks hypocritical. The founders supported racial genocide and chattel slavery, which then flourished in their new republic. And it’s good that historians and journalists want to reframe our historical narratives to focus on their impact on black Americans.</p> \n<p>Matthews argues that the success of the American Revolution allowed slavery to survive for decades. In reality, it was the failure of the revolution — the gulf between its promises and reality, rather than the promises themselves — that let slavery persist as long as it did.</p> \n<p><i>Jeff Stein is the founder of the </i><a href=""http://ithacavoice.com/"" target=""_blank""><i>Ithaca Voice</i></a><i> and a contributor to Salon.</i></p> \n<h3></h3>",Politics

Under the plan, every state will have a specific goal for reducing emissions from power plants, and state policymakers can decide for themselves how to get there.

It's just a tiny piece of what's needed to avert drastic temperature increases.

There's at least some reason for optimism: Since the EPA proposed the Clean Power Plan last summer, nations like China and Brazil <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/7/3/8886815/climate-goals-china-brazil-american"">have come out with fresh pledges</a> for constraining emissions, and the hope is that all these proposals <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/12/14/7389955/climate-deal-lima"">will get stitched together into a global climate agreement</a> at the UN talks in Paris this December.</p> \n<p>Climate experts say this still won't be enough to avert significant temperature increases.

Right now, we’re in a situation where <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/12/14/7389955/climate-deal-lima""><i>no</i> country is really cutting emissions enough</a> to avoid significant temperature increases [i.e., more than 2°C of warming] in the future. So is this rule really going to make that much of a difference in the big picture?</p> \n</div> \n<div class=""answer""> \n<p><em class=""name"">Gina McCarthy:</em> Well, I appreciate the focus on the bigger picture. Many of us do feel that we need to do a lot more to address climate change. But what we need to do, more than anything, is get started. So I think we’ll see that the Clean Power Plan and the president’s broader initiative is really going to be historic. Not because it solves the problem, but because it can be a turning point in the global discussion.</p> \n<p>I’ve been doing this work for a long time, and I don’t think there’s ever been a better point in time for us to make a big leap forward that would spark the kind of global action that we think is necessary. But you do have to get started. And I think we’re seeing that with this president calling climate change a moral responsibility, with the pope calling it a moral responsibility, which may be even more important globally.</p> \n<p>Just since the Clean Power Plan came out as a proposal, we’re seeing a new dynamic with China and Brazil and other countries really stepping up [<a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/7/3/8886815/climate-goals-china-brazil-american"">with their own commitments</a> to tackle climate emissions]. The whole tone of the discussion has changed. So we think that EPA can be part of delivering that big leap forward that will lead to a good outcome in Paris but also, eventually, a real global solution.</p> \n</div> \n<div class=""question""> \n<p><em class=""name"">Brad Plumer:</em>All of the EPA’s actions on carbon dioxide are being done under the auspices of the <a href=""http://www2.epa.gov/laws-regulations/summary-clean-air-act"">Clean Air Act</a>, a law that’s more than 40 years old. A lot of critics<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_greenhouse_gases_under_the_Clean_Air_Act#The_Suitability_of_the_Clean_Air_Act_for_Regulating_Greenhouse_Gases""> say</a> this law was never designed for dealing with carbon dioxide, that in some ways Obama is resorting to it as a sort of kludge because Congress couldn’t pass a climate bill in 2010. Is the Clean Air Act really the best tool here?</p> \n</div> \n<div class=""answer""> \n<p><em class=""name"">Gina McCarthy:</em> I think the president has made clear in his first term and beyond that congressional action would be welcome, that there are other, more flexible approaches we could use that may be beneficial. But Congress is not there. And that is very clear.</p> \n<p>The Supreme Court has spoken directly to the issue of whether the Clean Air Act applies to carbon pollution, and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts_v._Environmental_Protection_Agency"">they told us</a> [in 2007] that it was not just our authority but it was our responsibility to look at whether carbon pollution was impacting public health. And there’s a wealth of scientific data that supports that. So this is the Supreme Court. That’s an extremely strong foundation.</p> \n<p>But I actually do think the Clean Air Act is a strong tool to get significant reductions. This is a tool where we have 40 years of history of being extraordinarily successful in getting air pollution reductions. Over that time, <a href=""http://www.stateoftheair.org/2014/assets/ALA-SOTA-2014-Full.pdf"">we’ve reduced air pollution 70 percent while GDP has tripled</a>. So if you want to take a big leap forward, [the Clean Air Act] makes sense in terms of its ability to get reductions but also to keep the lights on and to keep energy affordable.</p> \n</div> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""3892802""><img src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3892802/air_pollution_vs_gdp.png""></div> \n<div class=""question""> \n<p><em class=""name"">Brad Plumer:</em>In the draft version of the Clean Power Plan, each state <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/6/4/5779052/how-to-figure-out-which-states-get-hit-hardest-by-obamas-climate-rule"">has its own individual goal for emissions reductions</a>, based on what EPA thinks is possible given the prospects for coal-to-gas switching, renewables, efficiency. But there are huge disparities in state goals. New York, which has already made strides in clean energy, has to cut power emissions 44 percent by 2030, whereas a coal-heavy state like Kentucky only has to cut 18 percent. Isn't this a bit unfair?</p> \n</div> \n<div class=""answer""> \n<p><em class=""name"">Gina McCarthy:</em> We have heard that. Part of the challenge is that we’re trying to do a couple of things here. We’re trying to identify what further reductions are achievable by every state. Because we want to make sure that every unit [i.e., coal or gas plant] can actually achieve the reductions we’re intending to achieve.</p> \n<p>So for some states, because of how far they’ve already moved with renewables and efficiency programs, they’re far ahead of others, and they have infrastructure in place that will allow them to continue this downward trend. Whereas states that have not been engaged or do not have that infrastructure will take a bit longer [to cut emissions].</p> \n<p><span>We have gotten a lot of feedback on this aspect of the proposal, about whether it’s fair and equitable. And we’ve considered comments from states on where they are today, what resources are available for them tomorrow, what’s available for them in the coming years, and I think you will see [the final rule in August] addresses those concerns pretty effectively.</span></p> \n</div> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""3892814""><img src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3892814/238866841__1_.png""></div> \n<div class=""question""> \n<p><em class=""name"">Brad Plumer:</em>What about the flip side? Some critics have worried that the rule <a href=""http://www.politico.com/agenda/story/2015/05/obama-transformative-energy-power-plan-000016"">might not be strong enough</a>, that some states might be able to hit EPA’s emission targets with minimal effort — say, because renewables are growing faster than expected or coal plants are retiring faster than you expected. Is there a risk the rule could be too <i>weak</i> for some states? Will there be a way to revisit targets if that happens?</p> \n</div> \n<div class=""answer""> \n<p><em class=""name"">Gina McCarthy:</em> We certainly have obligations under the Clean Air Act to routinely revisit issues. But I am actually as optimistic as your question is about the ability of utilities to restructure and think about a cleaner energy system. Because this is exactly what's already happening in the energy market today.</p> \n<p>We’re moving away from coal because it’s not competitive with natural gas. Folks are beginning to look at natural gas as more of a complement to strong renewables. We are seeing the growth in energy efficiency programs across the United States — and we’re seeing the benefits of those programs in people’s pocketbooks. I don’t know if you saw the <a href=""http://www.utilitydive.com/news/rggi-carbon-trading-program-brings-13-billion-in-benefits-for-northeast/402317/"">report</a> the Analysis Group put out on RGGI [a cap-and-trade program in the Northeast that puts a price on carbon emissions and uses the proceeds to fund things like energy efficiency], indicating that it cut consumer electricity and heating bills by about $460 million.</p> \n<p>Similarly, if you just look at the Clean Power Plan, our proposal is estimated to reduce electricity costs 8 percent by 2030. Because that’s what energy efficiency does. That’s what renewable energy does. It builds an entirely different type of system that doesn’t require constant feeding and constant money to upkeep.</p> \n<p>So I think what you’re talking about, and what we’re trying to allow the states to recognize, is that we’re not building a future that is more expensive. We’re talking about a transition that’s already happening, and, yes, states <em>should</em> want to go even further than we require, because that’s good for everyone.</p> \n</div> \n<div class=""question""> \n<p><em class=""name"">Brad Plumer:</em>I saw EPA has gotten more than 2 million comments about its rule. Many are supportive, but some have been critical: The coal industry, for one, <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.eenews.net/stories/1060019030"">argues</a> the plan could hurt grid reliability [though other analyses <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://info.aee.net/brattle-reliability-report"">disagree</a>]. How do you decide which of these complaints to take seriously and which to just disagree with?</p> \n</div> \n<div class=""answer""> \n<p><em class=""name"">Gina McCarthy:</em> We actually received over 4.3 million comments on the proposal, so it’s even more than you thought. But one of the things we do is that we’ll take every comment seriously. We don’t pick and choose among them. We actually do the analysis for each and every substantive comment so that people can see we did a thoughtful look.</p> \n<p>And for EPA, reliability and affordability of the electricity supply is part and parcel of how we’re going to do this rule, because the section of the Clean Air Act that we’re working [<a href=""https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/7411"">section 111(d)</a>] in requires us to take those issues into strong consideration. And anybody in the environmental world would want to do so, because delivering reliable energy is extraordinarily important from a public health perspective. So we take it very seriously.</p> \n<p>Now, that doesn’t mean every comment that we receive raises a valid point. We have to take a look and ask what the points are. Do we think it’s a concern in the rule? Do we need to make changes? You’ll see that we will be making changes on the basis of all these comments, determining for ourselves whether they raise concerns and making appropriate changes.</p> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3893050/shutterstock_172246661.0.jpg"" alt=""shutterstock_172246661.0.jpg"" data-chorus-asset-id=""3893050""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">An electric power plant in Queens, New York. (Shutterstock)</p> \n</div> \n<div class=""question""> \n<p><em class=""name"">Brad Plumer:</em>With any large rule like this, there’s always the risk of unintended consequences. For example, some critics <a href=""http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2015/01/obama-climate-plan-threatens-us-forests-114718.html#.Va1v_CpViko"">have worried</a> that EPA could give too much credit for using biomass for electricity even in cases where that's not beneficial for climate change. Do you worry about that? Are there other unintended consequences you think about?</p> \n</div> \n<div class=""answer""> \n<p><em class=""name"">Gina McCarthy:</em> In terms of biomass, the concern you raise is one we do acknowledge, and we’re going to be doing more upfront work to ensure that the biomass that is allowed to be calculated [for reducing greenhouse gas emissions] actually does so. So we’re going to let science determine those decisions.</p> \n<p>You also hear concerns that things can happen in the utility world that are unforeseen. This arose with our <a href=""http://www.epa.gov/mats/"">Mercury and Air Toxics Standards</a>, as well [a different rule to reduce mercury pollution from coal plants]. There we developed an opportunity for people to come into the agency and discuss unforeseen circumstances and work through them. We'll do the same with this rule, because we know that things can happen.</p> \n<p>But frankly, we see this rule as being less vulnerable than the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards to unforeseen changes in the energy world. That was about shutting down facilities in order to install big equipment, while this rule is all about looking at opportunities to expand the way in which states invest in energy. But we’re certainly not going to be ignoring that in any way.</p> \n</div> \n<div class=""question""> \n<p><em class=""name"">Brad Plumer:</em>We've seen <a href=""http://www.republicreport.org/2015/are-utility-companies-changing-their-strategy-to-fight-obama-power-plan/"" target=""_blank"">a few governors </a>suggest they might not comply with the rule [Oklahoma and Indiana, mainly]. Sen. Mitch McConnell <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/20/us/politics/mitch-mcconnell-urges-states-to-help-thwart-obamas-war-on-coal.html?_r=0"" target=""_blank"">has urged</a> states to resist. Does this worry you?</p> \n</div> \n<div class=""answer""> \n<p><em class=""name"">Gina McCarthy:</em> I still think the vast majority of states are going to take advantage of this rule [i.e., develop their own state plans for meeting the emissions goals]. But if any governors decide for their own reasons that doing a state plan is not something they want to do, they have that choice.</p> \n<p>That doesn’t mean, however, that those states won’t be obligated [to make emission cuts] under the rule — they certainly will be. It will just mean the federal government will have to take action instead.</p> \n<p>We’re hoping that those outcomes are limited. We’re also hoping people will consider studies showing that the states <a href=""http://insideclimatenews.org/news/26022015/why-states-rejecting-epas-clean-power-plan-could-face-bigger-rate-hikes"">that could most benefit</a> from doing their own carbon pollution plan are the same states where governors are making these statements.

At the same time, environmentalists have raised concerns that things like methane leaks might undercut those climate benefits. How do you think about the role of fracking in climate policy?</p> \n</div> \n<div class=""answer""> \n<p><em class=""name"">Gina McCarthy:</em> Hydrofracking has certainly changed the energy dynamic considerably. You are absolutely right, it has created an opportunity for a shift away from coal into natural gas, and that shift has been enormously beneficial from a clean air perspective, as well as from a climate perspective.</p> \n<p>But it’s not EPA’s job to decide whether we like natural gas or coal better. It’s our job to actually look at where we can get continued carbon pollution reductions from both fossil fuels. And it’s also our broader responsibility to work with states and ensure that hydrofracking is done in a safe and responsible way. We also know there’s methane to be recaptured in hydrofracking operations, and in all oil and gas upstream work, and <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/1/14/7545377/obama-methane-climate"">we actually have a rule</a> that will try to address the methane issue.</p> \n<p>That does not mean we think it will slow down or be a continued detriment to fracking operations. What it means is that there are considerable opportunities to save money by capturing methane. It is a product being leaked, not a waste product. We think we can have safer and responsible operations that will protect water, and protect our climate from methane leaks, while ensuring that we’re not forcing any fuel out of the mix in the near future, including coal and natural gas.</p> \n</div> \n<div class=""question""> \n<p><em class=""name"">Brad Plumer:</em>Coal would take the biggest hit under this climate rule — as well as all the other air pollution rules EPA has put out. What role do you envision coal playing in our future energy mix?</p> \n</div> \n<div class=""answer""> \n<p><em class=""name"">Gina McCarthy:</em> I don’t know whether I envision it in any way, but what we see is that that coal has certainly been diminishing in terms of its position in the energy supply. This has been happening since the 1980s, although there’s certainly been a more significant decline with the advent of natural gas. What we look at is, where is the energy world heading, what are the cost-effective options to get reductions in the Clean Power, and how do we marry all that up?</p> \n<p>I think what we’re seeing and expecting is that coal will continue to be a significant part of the energy mix in 2030. It won’t be as large as it was before — that is both a function of the energy market today as well as long-term investment signals that utilities will take from looking at carbon pollution reductions looking forward.</p> \n<p>But this is also something the private sector was already looking at, that the business community has been looking at. The march toward a low-carbon future is not being led by EPA. It's a significant change that's already happening, and which the Clean Power Plan will hopefully continue to move forward.</p> \n</div> \n<p><em>Transcript has been very lightly edited for length and clarity.</em></p>",Politics
Donald Trump's only real foreign policy idea: steal foreigners' oil,http://www.vox.com/2015/7/28/9057899/donald-trump-steal-oil,"""I still canâ€™t believe we left Iraq without the oil.""","<p>It looks like Donald Trump's presidential campaign is going to be with us for a little while longer, and probably through the first Republican debate. At some point, then, it becomes impossible to avoid talking about Trump's policies — yes, even his foreign policy.</p> \n<p>Trump doesn't really like talking about policy, and he doesn't have what you might call a clear policy agenda. But there is one quote that really gets to the core of his foreign policy worldview and what a Trump administration foreign policy would look like. Here it is, <a href=""http://thinkprogress.org/politics/2011/04/04/155527/trump-iraq-oil-soldiers-died-vain/"">from a 2011 TV appearance</a> (emphasis mine):</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>I very simply said that Iran is going to takeover Iraq, and if that’s going to happen, <strong>we should just stay there and take the oil</strong>. They want the oil, and why should we? We de-neutered Iraq, Iran is going to walk in, take it over, take over the second largest oil fields in the world. That’s going to happen. That would mean that all of those soldiers that have died and been wounded and everything else would have died in vain– and I don’t want that to happen. I want their parents and their families to be proud.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Yes, Trump believes that America should ""take Iraq's oil.""</p> \n<p>What does this mean? Iraq has proven reserves of <a href=""http://www.iea.org/media/Factsheet_OilSupplyInIraq.pdf"">143 billion</a> barrels. Does Trump understand that that's a lot? Does he have a plan for pumping and moving it? Does he envision loading all 20 billion tons of crude onto the Queen Mary II and sailing it through Suez on a deluxe luxury cruise to America? Trump talks a lot about capitalism — does he understand that oil is traded on a global market, and that ""taking it"" is not really how it works?</p> \n<p>This was no one-off quote. Trump has been repeating this idea for years:</p> \n<p>""I would not leave Iraq and let Iran take over the oil."" —2011, <a href=""http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2011/04/11/trump-will-probably-run-as-independent-if-he-doesnt-win-gop-nomination/?mod=WSJBlog"">to the Wall Street Journal</a></p> \n<p>""I say we should take it [Iraq's oil] and pay ourselves back."" —2013, <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/mar/15/donald-trump-cpac-speech-republicans-iraq"">to CPAC</a>, arguing the US should re-invade Iraq</p> \n<p>""I’ve said it a thousand times … we shouldn’t have been there, but if we’re there, take the oil. Take the oil. At least pay back, at a minimum, pay back — take the oil. Well guess what? China is taking the oil, but they didn’t have to fight."" —2013, <a href=""http://www.politico.com/story/2013/06/donald-trump-iraq-oil-china-92135.html"">on Fox News</a></p> \n<blockquote lang=""en"" class=""twitter-tweet""> \n<p dir=""ltr"" lang=""en"">I still can’t believe we left Iraq without the oil.</p> \n— Donald J.

So much so that in the first quote I listed, he argues that plundering a bunch of oil would vindicate the lives of families of fallen American soldiers, and that <em>not</em> stealing oil would mean they had ""died in vain.""</p> \n<p>Trump thought this idea was so great, in fact, that he's been applying it elsewhere. You'll notice it's his answer to China's rise. It is also <a href=""http://www.newsmax.com/TheWire/donaldtrump-karlrove-gop-birther/2011/04/22/id/393742/"">his Libya policy</a>: In 2011, as Libya exploded into civil war, Trump said the US should invade to ""take the oil.""</p> \n<p>This is a way of thinking about the world that, as MSNBC's <a href=""http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/what-president-donald-trump-would-do-according-donald-trump"">Benjy Sarlin put it</a>, ""puts him somewhere to the right of King George.""</p> \n<p>It's also just about his only foreign policy idea that he seems to have given much thought; his positions otherwise tend toward standard Republican conservatism. The other major exception is Trump's more recent announcement that he opposed the 2003 Iraq invasion, although it's difficult to place that in a larger context of foreign policy thinking.</p> \n<p>So, to review, Donald Trump is a Republican and free market conservative businessman who opposes the free market exchange of fossil fuels, who believes the US should become a mercantilist colonial power that steals natural resources from other countries, and who opposed the 2003 Iraq invasion but believes the US should have re-invaded in 2013.</p> \n<p>It turns out that Donald Trump's central foreign policy plank is the same as his central domestic policy plank: that Donald Trump is very successful, and the rest of the world should be assimilated into his successes.</p>",Politics
How conservative media helped the far-right take over the Republican Party,http://www.vox.com/2015/7/30/9074761/conservative-media-republican-party,The right-wing media tail is now wagging the GOP dog.,"<p>Most people who follow politics are aware that something unusual is going on in the Republican party — unusual relative to major conservative parties in other developed democracies and unusual relative to American history. GOP leaders no longer appear in control of their own agenda. Instead, they are being dragged from crisis to failure to embarrassment and back to crisis by the most extreme elements of their coalition. The far right has captured the party.</p> \n<p>Over at the Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy, where she was a fellow this spring, longtime New York Times political reporter Jackie Calmes has released a long, fascinating discussion paper on the role of the conservative media in this state of affairs: <a href=""http://shorensteincenter.org/conservative-media-influence-on-republican-party-jackie-calmes/"">""'They Don’t Give a Damn about Governing': Conservative Media’s Influence on the Republican Party.""</a></p> \n<h3>Conservative media has gotten big enough to sway elections</h3> \n<p>There's been dedicated conservative media since the post–World War II years, and it has always had the same concerns — the nefarious role of immigrants, the perfidy of elites, the corruption of the welfare state — but for most of that time, it simply hasn't been big, well-funded, or stable enough to serve as conservatives' <i>only</i> media. It existed as a hectoring presence on the periphery of the Republican Party.</p> \n<p>That began changing in the '90s with talk radio and Fox News, both of which found enormous financial success and signaled to wealthy conservatives that media is worth funding (and could potentially take down a president).</p> \n<p>The early success of Rush Limbaugh and Fox prompted an explosion of new voices, shows, magazines, and (more recently) digital media like blogs and podcasts. There are now hundreds of conservative media outlets, not only the national ones you've heard of but regional, local, and niche outlets that speak directly and exclusively to the conservative (read: older white male) demographic. It's a full media ecosystem; there's no longer any need for conservatives to stray outside it to stay informed, or ""informed.""</p> \n<p>Alongside the growth in media (and funded by many of the same people) has emerged a newly muscular ideological machinery. Together they form what political scientist Richard Meagher half-jokingly calls <a href=""http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07393148.2012.729738#abstract"">""the vast right-wing conspiracy""</a>:</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>Conservative talk radio, print publications, television networks, and internet sites have numerous connections, both direct and indirect, with the think tanks, advocacy organizations, academic research centers, and foundations that develop and promote the Right's policy agenda.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Populist right-wing media has become the primary channel through which conservatives are educated, organized, and activated. (As Calmes documents, it has never been the same on the left; despite many attempts, partisan left-wing media has never approached the size or influence of its conservative counterpart. The left's organizing tends to emerge instead from advocacy and activist organizations.) A little attention from regional talk-radio hosts can muster hundreds of phone calls to politicians, along with protests and donations. In several cases, right-wing media has coordinated successful primary challenges to members of Congress (see: Eric Cantor).</p> \n<p>The result is a GOP that is terrified, above all, of displeasing its most vocal, most ideological, most extreme elements.</p> \n<h3>Media doesn't need to win elections to profit</h3> \n<p>The problem is that right-wing media is in no way dependent on the political success of the GOP. In fact, it's almost the opposite: The more the party establishment fails to deliver on the far right's (wildly unrealistic) demands, the more the audience feels betrayed, and the angrier it gets. That means more clicks, more phone calls, more engagement. It is to right-wing media's great benefit for the party to engage in a series of dramatic, doomed protest gestures like shutting down the government or attempting to repeal Obamacare for the 47th time. It stokes the outrage machine.</p> \n<p>Conservative media outlets and activists have entered into a self-reinforcing cycle of mutually supported radicalization. They have everything to gain by demonstrating their ideological purity and nothing to gain from compromise or nuance:</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>[Recently retired GOP Representative Tom] Latham and other Republicans complain [that] many in that media – in their zeal for audience share – willfully ignore the realities of a legislative process designed by the Founders to require deliberation, checks and balances, and compromise. ""They will not take 80 percent – it’s got to be 100 percent or you’re not pure,"" Latham said. ""They don’t give a damn about governing, or about anything than being pure themselves. And it’s causing more people to be concerned about primaries than ever before. I just don’t see – with continual pounding of the drums in the media and these outside groups – I don’t know how you function, I really don’t. I don’t know how you pass appropriation bills this year.""</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>The party establishment encouraged the rise of the right-wing media and exploited the Tea Party for electoral advantage, but now it has awakened a monster it can't control.</p> \n<p>The basic outlines of this story are probably familiar to most people reading Vox, but Calmes goes into lots of detail and elicits tons of great quotes from exasperated Republicans, some of whom were even brave enough to comment on record. What's striking about the party establishment figures quoted in the piece — the politicians, aides, and consultants who suffer the brunt of the perpetual rage machine — is that they are, almost without exception, despairing.</p> \n<p>No one knows how to stop the self-reinforcing cycle, even though everyone knows it is rendering the GOP incapable of governing or attracting new demographics, without which the party is fated to become a regionally based, ethnically homogenous niche party unable to win the presidency. In all the dozens of quotes given to Calmes, there isn't a single one that proposes a solution.</p> \n<p>So this is likely what we have to look forward to in coming years: more radicalization on the right, more outrage and obstructionism, and the GOP with a lock on the House through at least 2022. Should be fun.</p> \n<h3>No one should be surprised by this trend</h3> \n<p>Mainly you should go read Calmes's piece, but I do want to offer two semi-critical notes here.</p> \n<p>First, I think the paper would have benefited from taking more note of broader social and political trends. One paper can't cover everything, of course, but it's important to remember the broader polarization in which right-wing media flourished. I've <a href=""http://grist.org/politics/asymmetrical-polarization-the-lefts-gone-left-but-the-rights-gone-nuts/"">written about that polarization before</a> and won't rehash it, except to say that it goes much deeper than politics; it is cultural, racial, and geographic as well. Contrary to Obama's hopeful 2004 Democratic convention speech, there really is a Red America.</p> \n<p>That's the context for the rise of right-wing media, which is not some anomaly or accident, but an inevitable outcome of larger social forces. Understood that way, it's clear that it will take more to solve the problem than a few centrist Republicans speaking out. And it's clear that the much-discussed moderation of the party, which outsiders always believe is right around the corner, may be distant still. The process of polarization is likely to be meliorated, if at all, by <a href=""http://grist.org/climate-change/cohort-replacement-climate-deniers-wont-change-but-they-will-die/"">""cohort replacement,""</a> which is a polite way of saying that the aging white men so furious at the loss of ""their country"" will eventually die off.</p> \n<p>Second, I couldn't help being struck by Calmes's comments in this podcast about the paper:</p> \n<p><iframe src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/216180103&amp;color=ff5500"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" height=""166"" width=""100%""></iframe></p> \n<p>The first thing she says is that before launching her research project, she wasn't really aware of right-wing media beyond Limbaugh and National Review and was surprised at the size and radicalism of the right-wing media/activist network.</p> \n<p>I may be reading too much into that (or listening too much into it, as it were), but it seems to me that someone like Calmes, who has been reporting on national politics since <a href=""http://www.nationaljournal.com/magazine/washington-s-most-influential-women-20120712?page=1"">1984</a>, ought to be more familiar with the dynamics driving the right. The radicalization of the right, driven by big-donor money and conservative media, is the defining feature of US politics today.</p> \n<p>One of the longstanding critiques of mainstream media on the left, from the very beginning of the blogosphere, was that reporters in the Beltway ""Village"" failed to grasp modern conservatism and wrote about it in such a way as to sand down and mute its extremity. Their attachment to a certain mental model of politics — ""both sides"" with their mirror-image extremes and centers — made them blind to <a href=""http://grist.org/politics/asymmetrical-polarization-the-lefts-gone-left-but-the-rights-gone-nuts/"">""asymmetrical polarization.""</a> In fact, people are still making that critique; here's <a href=""http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/07/27/the-donald-and-the-delusional/?module=BlogPost-Title&amp;version=Blog%20Main&amp;contentCollection=Opinion&amp;action=Click&amp;pgtype=Blogs&amp;region=Body"">Paul Krugman</a> from just a few days ago.</p> \n<p>Calmes is probably not a fair target for that critique. She certainly deserves kudos for attacking this subject directly. But there are still plenty of mainstream political reporters who cling to the both-sides illusion to this day, imagining politics as a sober business conducted by Very Serious People in suits, premised on a shared set of facts and assumptions. But as the far right sends the Republican Party through an ever-more-absurd series of showdowns and tantrums, the illusion is fading. Now lots of established journalists seem to have moved on to the bargaining stage of grief, holding out hope that the Adults will once again take charge.</p> \n<p>But that train has left the station. The GOP is trapped in a downward spiral now, and only something truly catastrophic to the party's fortunes could break it out. For now, thanks to an idiosyncratic combination of (old, white) voter intensity, gerrymandering, and billionaire funding, radicalism still works for Republicans, perhaps not at the presidential level, but certainly in Congress. That's likely to continue for quite some time, rendering American democracy dysfunctional at a time when it desperately needs to act. That's depressing to lots of journalists (and to me), but getting past it begins with identifying and describing it clearly, without nostalgia or false hope.</p>",Politics
Clean energy is a growing political juggernaut. Should it leave climate change behind?,http://www.vox.com/2015/7/31/9080701/clean-energy-climate-connection,It's a political puzzle.,"<p>There's a <a href=""https://nextgenclimate.global.ssl.fastly.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/memo.pdf"">new poll</a> of eight key swing states out, and it shows that — surprise! — voters in swing states love clean energy.</p> \n<p>Specifically, the poll (done by Hart Research on behalf of NextGen Climate  Action) shows that 70 percent of swing state voters have a favorable reaction to the goal of 50 percent clean energy by 2030, including 54 percent of Republicans. Similar majorities support a target of 100 percent clean energy by 2050. Somewhat smaller majorities look favorably on several other clean energy policies, including upgrading the power grid and raising state renewable energy standards.</p> \n<p>At this point, polls showing robust, bipartisan support for clean energy and pollution reduction are so common that they come as no surprise (see <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/6/2/5772842/this-poll-is-very-good-news-for-obamas-new-epa-rules"">here</a>, <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/6/2/8701917/americans-opinion-climate-change"">here</a>, <a href=""http://grist.org/politics/pew-poll-clean-energy-still-popular-among-everyone-except-older-conservatives/"">here</a>, <a href=""http://grist.org/energy-policy/2011-11-06-polling-reveals-that-being-anti-clean-energy-is-bad-politics/"">here</a>, <a href=""http://grist.org/news/americans-want-more-renewable-energy-and-more-climate-change-prep/"">here</a>, <a href=""http://grist.org/energy-policy/2011-02-18-the-american-people-support-clean-energy-does-boehner/"">here</a>, etc. forever). Americans love clean energy!</p> \n<p>Most Americans, that is. The one demographic that remains steadfast in its support for fossil fuels and skepticism toward alternatives is — surprise! — Tea Party Republicans, i.e., hyper-conservative older white guys.</p> \n<p>Why do the most ardent ideological conservatives oppose clean energy? Because for them, energy, like almost everything else, has become a part of the culture war. Partly that means they reject it simply because the left supports it. But specifically, among engaged partisans on both sides, energy has become inextricably bound to the climate change debate. That's part of why support is so high among self-identified liberals and why so many conservatives view it as a big-government boondoggle.</p> \n<p>This poses interesting political strategy questions for both parties.</p> \n<h3>Republicans would be better off detaching clean energy from climate</h3> \n<p>On the Republican side, the current situation works well for the fossil fuel billionaires <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/gabe-elsner/the-secret-network-of-fos_b_7887278.html"">funding the fight against clean energy</a>. And it works well for conservative media and activists, who are loath to agree or cooperate on anything with liberals.</p> \n<p>But for Republican leaders, and the professional political class concerned with the party's electoral fortunes, it's more complicated. They cannot speak directly against fossil fuels; there's too much money involved. But clean energy is popular and growing, rapidly transitioning from niche to serious player in energy markets. Some of the states with the most installed wind and solar have Republican governors. Republican-led cities are investing in clean energy and transit. There's an economic and cultural shift underway, and if the right-wing base remains intransigent, it will be same-sex marriage all over again — the base will set the agenda, the whole GOP will be branded as backward and out of touch, and they'll get steamrolled.</p> \n<p>Some conservatives seem to have caught on to this and are attempting to rehabilitate clean energy. If you look at billionaire conservative Jay Faison's website, purportedly devoted to convincing conservatives to accept climate change, you find that it is overwhelmingly devoted to the business-friendly benefits of clean energy.</p> \n<h3>Democrats would be better off keeping them attached</h3> \n<p>For the Democrats, it's a different and considerably more favorable set of choices.</p> \n<p>One option would be to downplay climate change (which is seen as divisive) in favor of a focus on clean energy (which is more broadly popular), seeking to remove barriers to bipartisan cooperation. On this view, climate has become a stigma, a sticking point, and it would be better make progress on clean energy independent of it. Help conservatives get on board by meeting them where they are, as it were, instead of forcing them to accept climate change. This is one of the recommendations of the <a href=""http://thebreakthrough.org/archive/climate_pragmatism_innovation"">""Climate Pragmatism""</a> stuff out of the Breakthrough Institute, along with more consultant memos and op-eds than I care to remember.</p> \n<p>This would be a familiar strategy: triangulation, the tactical maneuver of choice for mainstream Democrats since 1992. It envisions setting aside differences and divisions and coming together around shared priorities. It hasn't worked during the Obama years, ever, not once, but who knows. Hope springs eternal.</p> \n<p>A more ruthless Democratic strategist, one more concerned with winning than coming together, might counsel the opposite. If its association with climate change is preventing conservatives from embracing clean energy, then emphasize that association at every opportunity. Public opinion on clean energy is consistent, deep, and positive; public opinion on climate change is shallow and wishy-washy. The latter won't drag the former down; the former will lift the latter up. If Democrats can connect climate change with a more positive story of innovation, economic opportunity, and national purpose, they can cleanse it of some of the dour, hectoring tone it has taken on for many Americans.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, climate will act as a force field keeping the right away, which will allow Democrats to own both issues for a generation. (And in a generation, they will almost certainly be top national priorities.) Dems will win victories for clean energy not by persuading or cajoling conservatives to their side, tiptoeing around climate, but by coupling national peril with national opportunity, without hedging or apology, confident that they are on the right side of history. Republicans will be forced to chase them instead of obstructing them.</p> \n<p>It will be interesting to watch Hillary Clinton navigate this issue. Her <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/7/26/9044343/hillary-clinton-renewable-solar"">first sally</a> indicates  that she is going with the smarter strategy, headlining an ambitious clean energy goal but very much framing it as a response to climate change — keeping the two connected. Perhaps she and her advisers are taking a cue from Obama, who <a href=""http://grist.org/politics/obama-finally-understands-political-polarization-does-hillary/"">discovered</a> that he got the most done, and was most popular, when he acted boldly (and unilaterally, if necessary) on liberal priorities instead of trimming his sails in hopes of conservative cooperation.</p> \n<p>It will also be interesting to see, once we're past the Trump Circus, how the eventual Republican nominee treats the issue. The ""moderate"" candidates like Jeb Bush are already <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/5/26/8654265/jeb-bush-climate-change"">squirming</a> on climate change, seeking a path between an increasingly embarrassing science denialism and a politically verboten discussion of serious climate policy. How will Bush approach energy? So far he seems to be taking the <a href=""http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2015/07/23/3683904/jeb-bush-on-oil-and-gas-subsidies/"">""remove all energy subsidies""</a> line popular among conservative economists and politicians who are fully aware that renewable energy subsidies are vulnerable and fossil fuel subsidies really aren't.</p> \n<p>Will clean energy get enough attention and momentum to demand more of him, or of whoever wins the GOP scrum? That would be a significant marker.</p>",Politics

You can look at it in a few different ways. Optimistically, the program has the potential to transform the US electricity industry, pushing utilities in every state to take cleaner energy much more seriously. The administration <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/7/21/9007165/gina-mccarthy-epa-climate"" target=""_blank"">is also hoping</a> this new rule will give a much-needed jolt to global climate talks, spurring other countries to respond with further actions. </span></p> \n<p><span class=""author-24"">Or you could take the dour view: This is a jury-rigged, legally vulnerable plan that's still only a small piece of what's necessary to slow the pace of global warming. (By my calculations, this rule amounts to a 6 percent cut in current US greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 — so think of it as just one part of <a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/obama-climate-plan/what-is-obamas-plan-to-tackle-global-warming"" target=""_blank"">Obama's broader climate plan</a>.)</span></p> \n<p><!--  ########  BEGIN SNIPPET  ########  --></p> \n<div data-analytics-category=""article"" data-analytics-action=""link:related"" class=""chorus-snippet s-related"">\n<span class=""s-related__title"">Related</span> <!-- Add links here --><a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/8/3/9090453/obama-climate-plan-full"" target=""_blank"">The Clean Power Plan is a big deal. But it's only one piece of Obama's broader climate agenda.</a>\n</div> \n<p>You can make a solid argument for each of these views. The truth is it will take years to see how this policy pans out. The success or failure of this plan <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/8/3/9090607/5-factors-clean-power-plan-impact"">will depend</a> on how states react, whether courts uphold it, how future presidents implement it, and how other countries respond. In the meantime, here are 14 key points to keep in mind:</p> \n<p><b>1)</b> The basics of the Clean Power Plan are fairly simple. The EPA is giving each state <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www2.epa.gov/cleanpowerplantoolbox/clean-power-plan-state-specific-fact-sheets"">an individualized goal for reducing emissions</a> from their electric power plants. States can then decide for themselves how to get there. They can switch from coal to natural gas, boost renewables, set up programs to boost energy efficiency in homes, enact cap-and-trade systems ... it's up to them. <span>States will have to submit plans by 2016-2018, start cutting by 2022 at the latest, and then keep cutting through 2030. If states refuse to submit a plan, the EPA will impose its own federal plan.</span></p> \n<div><span><br></span></div> \n<p><b>2)</b> Some details <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://common-resources.org/2015/10-things-we-looked-for-in-the-clean-power-plan-and-what-we-found/"">have changed</a> since the EPA's initial draft proposal last summer. For instance, the agency has <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.epa.gov/airquality/cpp/tsd-cpp-emission-performance-rate-goal-computation.pdf"">tweaked the formula it uses</a> to set individual state goals. States will now have until 2022 rather than 2020 before they have to start cutting. These tweaks will get lots of press attention, and they're of keen interest to policymakers and utilities. The EPA also hopes they'll solidify the rule against legal challenges. But they don't significantly alter the big picture.</p> \n<p><span><b>3)</b></span> If you add up all the state goals, the EPA expects that carbon dioxide emissions from US power plants will be roughly 32 percent lower in 2030 than they were in 2005. This is not<em> </em>a hard requirement, as some outlets have suggested — it's just the EPA's<a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/6/4/5779052/how-to-figure-out-which-states-get-hit-hardest-by-obamas-climate-rule""> estimate of what will happen</a> if all goes according to plan. It's also slightly more ambitious than the 30 percent reduction projected in last year's proposal.</p> \n<p><span><b>4)</b></span> That sounds like a huge cut, but it's smaller than it first sounds. Power plant emissions have already dropped <a href=""http://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.cfm?id=18511"">15 percent between 2005 and 2013</a>, due to a brutal recession, cheap natural gas pushing out coal, the rise of wind power, and improved efficiency. So with this new plan, EPA is expecting a further 20 percent cut in power plant emissions from 2013 levels by 2030.</p> \n<p><span><b>5)</b></span> How does that fit into the bigger climate picture? Power plants <a href=""http://www.epa.gov/climatechange/ghgemissions/gases/co2.html"">were responsible for 31 percent</a> of overall US greenhouse gas emissions in 2013 — the biggest single source. (Other major sources include carbon dioxide from cars, trucks, and industrial emitters, methane from oil and gas wells, nitrous oxide from agriculture, etc.) So if all goes as planned, the Clean Power Plan amounts to a 6 percentage point cut in current US greenhouse gas emissions by 2030.</p> \n<p><b>6)</b> To put that number in context, the Obama administration has pledged that overall US greenhouse gas emissions will decline <a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/obama-climate-plan/why-does-obama-want-to-cut-u-s-emissions-17-by-2020"" target=""_blank"">at least 26 percent below 2005 levels by 2025</a>. Adjusting for baselines, the Clean Power Plan can be expected to supply around one-quarter of those cuts. It's an important climate policy, although far from the whole story:</p> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""3921962"" alt=""US_greenhouse_gas_goals.0.png"" src=""https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3921962/US_greenhouse_gas_goals.0.png""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">(<a href=""http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/UploadedPDF/2000274-Taxing-Carbon-What-Why-and-How.pdf"">Tax Policy Center</a>)</p> \n<p><strong>7)</strong> Think of the Clean Power Plan, then, as just one component <a href=""http://www.epa.gov/climatechange/ghgemissions/gases/co2.html"">of a much broader Obama climate agenda</a>. The administration has <i>also</i> been tightening fuel economy rules for cars and trucks (which, together, could end up cutting as much CO2 as the power plant rule does). It's upgrading efficiency standards for household appliances. It's cracking down on methane leaks from oil and gas wells. And so on. This is <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonkblog/wp/2013/06/25/obama-tries-the-kitchen-sink-approach-to-global-warming/"">a ""kitchen-sink"" approach</a> to climate change — throwing a barrage of executive-branch actions at the problem, trying to push down emissions piece by piece.</p> \n<p><strong>8)</strong> There are, however, two big reasons the Clean Power Plan could have an outsize impact, according to its backers. First, as EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/7/21/9007165/gina-mccarthy-epa-climate"">told me</a>, the Obama administration hopes this plan will bolster ongoing UN talks over a global climate agreement. This year, we've already seen China <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/11/11/7200909/US-china-climate-deal-cutting-emissions"">respond with its own pledge</a> to restrain greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. The idea here is that US action will inspire other countries to take stronger steps in turn. It's hardly a surefire plan, but see <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/12/15/7396387/lima-climate-deal-voluntary"">this interview</a> with political scientist David Victor for more on the logic of this approach.</p> \n<p><strong>9)</strong> Second, <a href=""http://www.utilitydive.com/news/what-to-expect-from-the-epas-final-clean-power-plan/403270/"">there's an argument</a> that this rule could spur a major shift in mindset among US electric utilities. For decades, utilities have largely focused on building more power plants — primarily fossil fuel plants — to satisfy ever-rising electricity demand. Now utilities in 49 states will have to start thinking more creatively about <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/7/23/9020019/energy-markets-wind-and-solar"">how to accommodate variable renewable energy</a>, how best to <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/6/26/8849695/weatherization-e2e-study-response"">boost energy efficiency</a>, and so on. In our <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/7/21/9007165/gina-mccarthy-epa-climate"">interview</a>, McCarthy implied that this change in mindset could be just as important as the plan's specific emissions targets — and create momentum for further action on clean energy.</p> \n<p><strong>10)</strong> Some opponents of the Clean Power Plan <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/with-new-epa-regulations-looming-some-states-gain-from-coals-free-fall/2015/07/23/80001208-2c93-11e5-bd33-395c05608059_story.html"">are warning</a> that states will struggle to meet the EPA's targets; that utilities will have to close too many coal plants, threatening grid reliability; and that electric bills will soar. <span>Any rule this complex will inevitably have problems, but it's worth taking doomsday claims with a big grain of salt. The EPA has been regulating the power sector for a long time, and industry claims of disaster </span><a href=""http://prospect.org/article/behind-numbers-polluted-data"">rarely pan out</a><span>. What's more, many states — like Kentucky — were already planning to shutter some of their coal plants anyway, in response to low natural gas prices. A number of states </span><a href=""http://www.politico.com/agenda/story/2015/05/obama-transformative-energy-power-plan-000016"">will be able to meet EPA's targets</a><span> with relatively low effort.</span></p> \n<p><b>11)</b> On the opposite side, Michael Grunwald <a href=""http://www.politico.com/agenda/story/2015/08/why-obamas-epic-climate-plan-isnt-such-a-big-deal-000183"" target=""_blank"">argues</a> that the Clean Power Plan isn't a big deal at all. After all, he says, power-plant emissions already fell 15 percent between 2005 and 2013, and this plan just continues that pace. But that argument seems equally overstated. As various studies <a href=""http://iopscience.iop.org/1748-9326/9/9/094008/pdf/1748-9326_9_9_094008.pdf"" target=""_blank"">have found</a>, US power plant emissions aren't destined to keep plunging without further policy. One <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.cfm?id=18511"">big reason for last decade's drop</a> was the massive recession, which hopefully won't repeat itself anytime soon. What's more, thanks to the shale gas boom, most of the ""easy"" cuts have already been made — as utilities retired their oldest plants and switched from natural gas. The harder cuts are yet to come, including making greater use of renewable power. That's what this plan aims to do, and it's a departure from business as usual.</p> \n<p><strong>12)</strong> A more immediate question is whether this plan will hold up in court. The EPA does have authority to regulate greenhouse gases — the Supreme Court <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts_v._Environmental_Protection_Agency"">has said so quite clearly</a>. But the Clean Power Plan is an unprecedented regulation being done under Section 111(d) of the Clean Air Act, a rarely used provision. Industry groups are certain to challenge it in court. See Nathan Richardson <a href=""http://common-resources.org/2015/a-quick-clean-power-plan-legal-faq/"">for a rundown of the legal risks</a>.</p> \n<p><strong>13)</strong> Another key question: <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/5/5/8542787/climate-change-2016-election"">How will the next president deal with the Clean Power Plan</a>? After all, states don't submit implementation plans for cutting emissions until between 2016 and 2018, when Obama will be out of office. Whoever wins the White House next year could have a lot of leeway to approve those plans. A president hostile to climate policy could allow skeptical states like Texas to submit weaker plans, for instance. Every presidential candidate should be asked about this.</p> \n<p><strong>14)</strong> Granted, this is true of all of Obama's entire climate agenda. Whether US greenhouse gas emissions keep falling will depend on whether the next president <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/5/5/8542787/climate-change-2016-election"">continues to cut emissions</a> or dismantles his climate policies (and on whether Congress decides to step up). Likewise, the ultimate trajectory of global warming will depend on <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/12/14/7389955/climate-deal-lima"">how other countries respond</a>, on whether clean energy keeps growing, on various technological developments.

The Clean Power Plan is a big deal. But itâ€™s only one piece of Obamaâ€™s climate agenda.,http://www.vox.com/2015/8/3/9090453/obama-climate-plan-full,Obama's climate plan is bigger than most people realize.,"<p>On Monday afternoon, the Obama administration<a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/8/2/9086559/obama-climate-plan-preview""> released its Clean Power Plan</a>, a major new EPA rule that aims to cut carbon dioxide emissions from the nation's electric power plants.</p> \n<p>A bunch of media outlets are referring to this as ""Obama's climate plan."" But that's not quite<em> </em>right. More precisely, this rule is just one piece of <a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/obama-climate-plan/what-are-the-obama-administrations-specific-climate-policies"" target=""_blank"">a much broader Obama agenda</a> to reduce US greenhouse gas emissions over the next decade. The Clean Power Plan is certainly a significant component, but it isn't even expected to account for a majority of the cuts Obama's envisioning. So keep an eye on all those other rules and policies, as well.</p> \n<h3>Obama's climate agenda involves a whole slew of rules and regulations</h3> \n<p>Broadly speaking, President Obama's climate change plan boils down to a simple set of numbers. The United States is currently taking part <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/12/14/7389955/climate-deal-lima"">in international talks</a> to address global warming. And as part of those talks, the Obama administration has vowed that US greenhouse gas emissions will decline 26 to 28 percent below 2005 levels by 2025:</p> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""3921962"">\n<img src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3921962/US_greenhouse_gas_goals.0.png""> \n<div class=""caption"">(<a href=""http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/UploadedPDF/2000274-Taxing-Carbon-What-Why-and-How.pdf"">Tax Policy Center</a>)</div> \n</div> \n<p>That's not an easy task. As of 2013, US greenhouse gas emissions <a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/obama-climate-plan/why-have-u-s-carbon-dioxide-emissions-fallen-since-2005"">had fallen</a> just 8.5 percent below 2005 levels, a drop that largely happened due to the recession, to a natural gas boom that pushed out dirtier coal power, and to a rise in vehicle efficiency. But that's still not enough. And more recently, emissions have started creeping up again. Plus, Congress has no interest in passing climate legislation of any sort.</p> \n<p>So to push down emissions even further, the Obama administration has been issuing an <a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/obama-climate-plan/what-are-the-obama-administrations-specific-climate-policies"">array of new rules and regulations</a> through the EPA and other executive-branch agencies. A partial list includes:</p> \n<ul> \n<li>Stricter <a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/obama-climate-plan/what-are-u-s-fuel-efficiency-standards-for-cars-and-trucks"">fuel economy standards</a> for cars and light trucks, which will steadily rise through 2025.</li> \n<li>Stricter <a href=""http://www.epa.gov/otaq/climate/regs-heavy-duty.htm"">fuel economy standards</a> for heavy trucks, buses, and vans, which will steadily rise through 2027.</li> \n<li>Proposed <a href=""http://www2.epa.gov/cleanpowerplan/2013-proposed-carbon-pollution-standard-new-power-plants"">CO2 emission standards</a> for any new coal- and gas-fired power plants built in the United States. This rule, when finalized, will make it extremely difficult to build any new coal plants that don't capture and bury their carbon dioxide emissions (a still-nascent technology).</li> \n<li>Standards <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/white-house-targets-methane-gas-emissions/2014/03/28/1c93b498-b685-11e3-b84e-897d3d12b816_story.html"">to curtail methane leaks</a> from all new oil and gas wells, as well as voluntary partnerships to limit methane from agriculture. </li> \n<li>Various <a href=""https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2014/09/16/fact-sheet-obama-administration-partners-private-sector-new-commitments-"">initiatives to curtail hydrofluorocarbons</a>, another potent greenhouse gas used in air conditioners and refrigeration.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>None of the above has gone through Congress — most of it is being done under legal authority that the Supreme Court granted the EPA back in 2007.</p> \n<p>You can also throw in other policies enacted throughout Obama's presidency that have helped reshape the energy landscape and curtail emissions. There were the expanded tax credits for wind and solar power in the 2009 stimulus bill. The Energy Department has been setting <a href=""http://energy.gov/eere/buildings/appliance-and-equipment-standards-result-large-energy-economic-and-environmental"">new energy efficiency standards</a> for household appliances. The EPA crafted a rule <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/6/29/8861167/supreme-court-EPA-ruling-mercury-coal"">cracking down on mercury pollution</a>, which has pushed utilities to retire many of their oldest, dirtiest coal plants. Meanwhile, states like California and New York have conducted their own policies to boost clean energy and curtail emissions. It all adds up.</p> \n<h3>The Clean Power Plan is just one part of that climate agenda</h3> \n<p>Now, on top of all that, the EPA is finalizing its Clean Power Plan, which will directly address carbon dioxide emissions from existing<em> </em>power plants.</p> \n<p>This is certainly one of the more ambitious climate rules the Obama administration has done, given that power plants <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.epa.gov/climatechange/ghgemissions/gases/co2.html"">account for 31 percent of US greenhouse gas emissions</a>. And the Clean Power Plan is expected to have a serious impact on the electricity sector, reducing power plant emissions <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/8/2/9086559/obama-climate-plan-preview"">roughly 20 percent</a> from today's levels by 2030.</p> \n<p>But in the grand scheme of things, that amounts to a 6 percentage point cut in US greenhouse gases — or about one-quarter of the emission cuts necessary to hit Obama's 2025 climate goal. Significant? Yes. The whole story? No.</p> \n<h3>So will Obama's broader climate plan solve climate change?</h3> \n<p>Not by itself, no. Even Obama's broader climate plan is only one piece of an even bigger global effort. And that global plan has a whole lot of moving parts.</p> \n<p>First, the United States actually needs to hit those 2025 targets — and that's not yet guaranteed, even with the Clean Power Plan in place. A recent <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/5/28/8673339/hillary-clinton-climate-policy"">analysis</a> from the World Resources Institute suggests that the US will need either more climate policies from Congress (which looks unlikely right now) or new regulations from the next president. Those additional rules could involve things like emissions cuts from refineries, cement plants, airplanes, and so on, as well as strengthening some of Obama's existing policies. So <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/5/28/8673339/hillary-clinton-climate-policy"">a lot depends on the next president</a>.</p> \n<p>Second, other countries would have to take their own climate measures. After all, the United States only accounts for about 17 percent of global emissions. We certainly can't solve anything by ourselves. The Obama administration is hoping that its recent efforts — including the Clean Power Plan — will spur other countries to respond in kind. Over the past year, for instance, China and Brazil <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/7/3/8886815/climate-goals-china-brazil-american"">have put out</a> their own pledges for curbing emissions. The ultimate goal is for all these proposals <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/12/14/7389955/climate-deal-lima"">to get stitched together into a global climate agreement</a> at UN talks in Paris in December 2015.</p> \n<p>But ultimately, the whole world will need to step up its climate ambitions if we want to avoid significant temperature increases. The International Energy Agency <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/6/15/8783141/IEA-UN-climate-pledges"">recently estimated</a> that even if you take every nation's current climate pledges seriously, we're still on pace for around 3°C of warming by 2100 — well above the 2°C limit that most countries have set as a goal. Everyone needs to do more.</p> \n<p>So that's where the Clean Power Plan fits in the broader scheme of things. It's a major policy, yes, but stabilizing global temperatures and ""fixing"" climate change will require a lot of moving parts.</p> \n<p><b>Read more: </b><a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/8/2/9086559/obama-climate-plan-preview"" style=""font-family: Balto, Helvetica, Arial, 'Nimbus Sans L', sans-serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.65;"">Our full analysis of the Clean Power Plan.</a></p>",Politics
What impact will Obamaâ€™s Clean Power Plan have? It depends.,http://www.vox.com/2015/8/3/9090607/5-factors-clean-power-plan-impact,It's too soon to tell how significant this rule is.,"<p>The EPA's Clean Power Plan has finally been released. It is expected to cut greenhouse gas emissions from the US electric sector by 32 percent from 2005 levels by 2030. Your first stop should be <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/8/2/9086559/obama-climate-plan-preview"">Brad Plumer's explainer</a>, which gets into all the gory details.</p> \n<p>There will be a great deal of talk about the CPP this week, much of it about the mechanisms and timetables in the final rule, but the questions that matter most — what effect the CPP will have on America's transition to clean energy and the larger fight against climate change — simply cannot be answered yet.</p> \n<p>It's not a matter of modeling the numbers in the plan. Politics, law, and psychology will determine the program's fate more than economics or technology, which makes predictions an even dicier undertaking than usual. The plan's future is, in short, clouded in uncertainty.</p> \n<p>Here are the five biggest factors that will determine whether the CPP is a historic achievement, a failed opportunity, or something in between.</p> \n<h3>1) Legal challenges</h3> \n<p>The CPP faces a <a href=""http://common-resources.org/2015/a-quick-clean-power-plan-legal-faq/"">number of legal challenges</a> that, if successful, could weaken or destroy it. Two in particular are worth noting.</p> \n<p>The first has to do with a technical issue around Clean Air Act section 111(d), the provision under which EPA is regulating power plant carbon emissions. Back in 1990, Congress passed<strong> </strong>two versions of the Clean Air Act amendment in question. One supports the CPP. The other says that EPA can't regulate a pollutant from power plants under 111(d) if it has already regulated other pollutants from those power plants (like, say, mercury).</p> \n<p>EPA has read the supportive amendment as taking priority. Opponents say that decision exceeds the agency's authority. This is one of the arguments legal scholar Laurence <a href=""http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2015/07/laurence-tribe-climate-change.html"">""The Real Victim""</a> Tribe <a href=""http://grist.org/climate-energy/constitutional-scholar-laurence-tribe-sells-his-soul-to-big-coal-makes-terrible-arguments/"">has been pushing</a> on behalf of Peabody Coal. It's not a very good argument, but it turns entirely on how much deference the Court chooses to show EPA's reading of the statute. Until recently, that deference had been well-established (see: <a href=""https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/chevron_deference"">Chevron doctrine</a>), but in a number of recent cases, the Court has signaled that it plans to extend somewhat less deference these days, especially in regulatory matters with substantial economic impact. And since the CPP is definitely substantial, the Court may decide to weigh in on 111(d) directly.</p> \n<p>The second has to do with EPA's authority to regulate ""beyond the fenceline"" of individual power plants. When setting targets for states, the draft CPP took into account four building blocks: greater efficiency at power plants, a shift in production from coal plants to natural gas plants, more renewables, and more end-use energy efficiency. The last two are outside the fenceline of the power plants EPA is purportedly regulating.</p> \n<p>In the final proposal, EPA has dropped the fourth building block, efficiency, but kept the third, so a legal challenge on these grounds remains all but inevitable. I wrote about the issue at some length <a href=""http://grist.org/climate-energy/obamas-carbon-rule-hangs-on-this-one-legal-question/"">here</a> — long story short, EPA's use of 111(d) is defensible but novel, a sweeping program born out of a little-used regulatory tool, so there's no way to predict how courts will rule.</p> \n<p>If EPA lost the former case, the rule would be thrown out. If it lost the latter, the rule would only be weakened, as building block three is ""severable."" A great deal rests on whether, when courts take up these cases, they put an immediate stay on the rule or allow it to remain in effect while the case proceeds. (In the mercury case, though the final judgment was <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/6/29/8863175/supreme-courts-mercury-pointless"">negative</a>, the rule remained in effect while the court considered, which meant it had most of its effects regardless.)</p> \n<h3>2) State plans</h3> \n<p>Under the model of ""cooperative federalism"" established by the Clean Air Act, the federal government sets targets and the states determine how to comply. The CPP gives states even more flexibility and autonomy than usual, setting statewide targets (rather than targets for individual power plants) and allowing states to determine the best way to allocate reductions.</p> \n<p>The CPP's cost and effectiveness hinge to a large extent on what states choose to do. Likely the most cost-effective option is for states to join multi-state compliance regions, in which they could implement (for instance) a cap-and-trade system. Or they could join one of the existing cap-and-trade systems, like RGGI. The larger the area over which reductions are made, the more efficient the economics.</p> \n<p>Or states could opt for in-state trading. They could push lots of renewables and efficiency (for which the CPP offers incentives), or they could insist on  restricting themselves to large polluting plants, thus raising overall costs.</p> \n<p>Or they could, as several states now propose, ""just say no,"" simply <a href=""http://www.eenews.net/stories/1060022681"">refusing to write a plan</a>. In that case (barring a negative court ruling), the feds would write plans for those states.</p> \n<p>Some have argued that federal plans would not be as stringent as state plans, because they would be prohibited from using building block three, but the EPA insists it will maintain the stringency of the targets. (Much attention will focus on the <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.epa.gov/airquality/cpp/fs-cpp-proposed-federal-plan.pdf"">model federal plan</a> issued alongside the CPP.) There's nothing to stop states from suing and dragging their feet and making the whole enterprise as difficult and expensive as possible, though. Rumor has it one of America's political parties benefits when government is rendered dysfunctional.</p> \n<p>Anyway, states are always saying they want more flexibility under federal regulations. Now they have it. We'll see what they do with it. As Michael Levi <a href=""http://blogs.cfr.org/levi/2015/08/03/five-takeaways-on-the-epas-clean-power-plan/"">writes</a>, ""No one knows what mix of renewables, natural gas, and efficiency will result from the plan.""</p> \n<h3>3) The next president</h3> \n<p>States have a year to create plans (two years if they propose multistate plans and ask for an extension). If they refuse, it will take longer for the feds to write a plan for them. The official compliance period begins in 2022. And the legal challenges to the bill will take years to play out.</p> \n<p>All these issues will be resolved during the next presidency. Hillary Clinton has <a href=""https://www.hillaryclinton.com/p/briefing/factsheets/2015/07/26/renewable-power-vision/"">said</a> she will defend the CPP. A Rubio EPA is likely to be far less supportive. It could propose changes to weaken the rule. It could delay or weaken compliance plans or simply refuse to write them for recalcitrant states. If it did that, enviros would sue — unless the rule is thrown out, it's legally mandatory for EPA to follow through — but those lawsuits would eat up years more time. (The Supreme Court ruled that EPA could regulate CO2 in 2007; it's taken eight years to get this far.)</p> \n<p>In short, the CPP's impact, in size and in timing, hinges on <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/5/28/8673339/hillary-clinton-climate-policy"">who wins the next presidential election</a>.</p> \n<h3>4) The psychology of utility executives</h3> \n<p>There's an argument to be made — <a href=""http://www.politico.com/agenda/story/2015/08/why-obamas-epic-climate-plan-isnt-such-a-big-deal-000183"">Mike Grunwald has made it</a> — that unstoppable changes are underway in the electricity sector. Coal is getting so expensive, and renewables so cheap, that the emission reductions promised by the CPP are going to occur regardless. In other words, Grunwald says, the plan is so conservative that it will have virtually no effect on the current trajectory of the sector.</p> \n<p>I'm not so certain. A lot of the emission reductions in the US over the past few years can be traced to the massive recession; the economy could start growing at a greater clip. Much of the decline in coal was driven by low natural gas prices; those prices won't keep falling forever, and could even start rising. Renewables are growing fast, but the policies that support that growth are under <a href=""http://www.energyandpolicy.org/renewable-energy-state-policy-attacks-report"">concerted attack</a>; some of those attacks could succeed. Things could change. If nothing else, the CPP is a backstop.</p> \n<p>But many of its supporters believe it is something more, less due to its targets than to its mere existence. The idea is that it will force utility executives — <em>all</em> utility executives, not just ones with liberal customers — to start thinking about the clean energy transition in earnest, rather than assuming it can be forever delayed. That's a fundamental shift in thinking. And once they make that shift, they will find that opportunities to reduce emissions are everywhere, many of which will <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/7/28/9053283/clean-energy-efficiency-money"">reduce prices for their customers</a>. They will then set themselves to the task and easily exceed CPP targets.</p> \n<p>Or so goes the hope, which EPA administrator Gina McCarthy <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/7/21/9007165/gina-mccarthy-epa-climate"">articulated to Brad Plumer</a> recently. Obviously this involves some speculation and dime-store psychoanalysis, but I think there's something to it. For many utility executives, clean energy has been an annoyance, a demonstration project to appease enviros or a concern for colleagues in liberal states. The CPP, if implemented, could make it ""official"" for these folks that reducing emissions is US policy and they can no longer put it off. That in itself could spark transformation in parts of the country that have so far been left behind by the clean energy boom.</p> \n<h3>5) International climate talks</h3> \n<p>As Jonathan Chait argued in his <a href=""http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2015/05/obamas-clean-power-plan-can-save-the-world.html"">response to Grunwald</a>, one of the chief goals of the CPP is to give the US credibility in the Paris climate talks this November. Rather than pursuing the (likely futile) hope of a comprehensive, binding agreement, attention in the UNFCCC has turned to <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/12/14/7389955/climate-deal-lima"">aggregating voluntary commitments</a>. Obama has already promised that the US will cut emissions <a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/obama-climate-plan/why-does-obama-want-to-cut-u-s-emissions-17-by-2020"">at least 26 percent below 2005 levels by 2025</a>. As Brad <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/8/2/9086559/obama-climate-plan-preview"">explained</a>, the CPP would only secure about a quarter of the cuts needed to get there, but it is a big, dramatic step. The hope is that a sign of seriousness from the US, especially in the context of <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/8/3/9090453/obama-climate-plan-full"">the rest of Obama's climate agenda</a>, will prompt other countries to fortify their ambitions.</p> \n<p>Will the CPP have the desired effect? It's impossible to say. The truth of international negotiations is that countries are overwhelmingly focused on their own domestic politics, needs, and capabilities. That's what will mostly determine their commitments.</p> \n<p>But at the margins, a clear signal of American commitment could bolster the arguments of those within other countries fighting for ambition.</p> \n<p>Then again, as this post has argued, the future of the CPP is clouded in uncertainty. Perhaps other countries will wait and see how it fares in court, or whether states take it seriously, or who is elected president in 2016. Perhaps they won't truly believe the US is committed to emission reductions until one of its two major parties drops its denialism and intransigence on the issue.</p> \n<p>Who knows? As Chinese Prime Minister Chou En Lai is (<a href=""http://peterhousehold.blogspot.com/2011/07/chou-en-lai-on-french-revolution-did-he.html"">probably apocryphally</a>) said to have responded when Richard Nixon asked him about the impact of the French Revolution on Western civilization, ""it's too soon to tell.""</p>",Politics
"The 3 best moments from Obama's short, feisty climate speech",http://www.vox.com/2015/8/4/9096407/moments-obama-climate-speech,"Among them, a defense of government and a call for solidarity.","<p>Of the many things that went wrong with the 2009 push for a cap-and-trade bill — and they are <a href=""http://www.motherjones.com/blue-marble/2011/01/comic-climate-bill-six-acts"">legion</a> — one that has always rankled climate hawks is Obama's <a href=""http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/climate-bill-r-i-p-20100721"">tepid and inconsistent support</a> for the effort. When he talked about the issue, he sounded pro forma and defensive, as though reading from talking points instructing him to foreground ""green jobs"" and background climate itself. It never seemed as immediate to him, as close to his heart, as health care.</p> \n<p>Since the beginning of Obama's second term, and especially since he entered his ""lame duck"" period of <a href=""http://qz.com/457693/barack-obamas-lame-duck-period-could-be-one-of-the-least-lame-ever/"">furious activity</a>, his rhetoric on climate has grown much more sophisticated and much more personal. This was on display in his <a href=""https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/08/03/remarks-president-announcing-clean-power-plan"">speech on Monday</a> introducing the Clean Power Plan. It was short, but surprisingly pointed and passionate.</p> \n<p>Below are my three favorite points.</p> \n<h3>1) Climate change is irreversible</h3> \n<p>One basic feature of climate change, which still eludes most of America's political class, makes it uniquely urgent. Obama identifies it:</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>... I don't deal with issues if they’re easy to solve, because somebody else has already solved them.  And some of them are grim.  Some of them are heartbreaking.  Some of them are hard.  Some of them are frustrating.  But most of the time, the issues we deal with are ones that are temporally bound and we can anticipate things getting better if we just kind of plug away at it, even incrementally.  But this is one of those rare issues -- because of its magnitude, because of its scope -- that if we don't get it right we may not be able to reverse, and we may not be able to adapt sufficiently.  There is such a thing as being too late when it comes to climate change.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>I would quibble a little with the language here. I don't think anything will ever be ""too late,"" even if humans are reduced to roving packs of raiders in a post-apocalyptic wasteland. There's always a future.</p> \n<p>But the core point is crucially true: The big changes scientists anticipate if temperatures keep rising are <em>irreversible</em>, at least in any timespan relevant to our species. If we move too slowly and things get really bad, that's it. They're bad for good.</p> \n<p>In that sense, climate change is not like racism or poverty. We can chip away at those problems over decades; even if they rise temporarily, we can always bring them back down. If we screw up, our kids can fix it.</p> \n<p>Changes we allow in the climate are effectively permanent. And with changes already underway, every day that passes we give up a little something we can never get back. The next generation will be starting from a less stable, more volatile baseline, facing even grimmer changes. We have it better today than they ever will.</p> \n<p>This feature of the problem lends it a special urgency, but that is roughly the opposite of how US politicians actually deal with climate change, which is deny it, ignore it, or quibble over incremental reforms. Obama has achieved a lot through incremental reform, it is true, but as he says, ""the science tells us we have to do more.""</p> \n<h3>2) Regulations do lots of good, and the haters are always wrong</h3> \n<p>For all their victories on social issues lately, on economic issues mainstream Democrats are still intimidated by the right's arguments. They still bow before the transcendent wisdom of markets, shrink before debt and inflation scaremongering, pay lip service to a largely imaginary ""entitlement"" crisis, and accept the premise that regulations, by their very nature, disturb the ""free market"" and slow economic growth.</p> \n<p>The left-leaning insurgencies of Bernie Sanders and (at a smaller scale) Elizabeth Warren, both based primarily on economic liberalism, may be changing that. But Obama also deserves a little credit. Lately, he has been inching more and more toward a defense not just of particular programs or regulations but of activist government <em>as such</em> — something no prominent Democrat has done in <a href=""http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/12/04/democrats-are-petrified-of-defending-government-but-they-need-to-start.html"">quite a while</a>.</p> \n<p>That's not the main point, though. The main point is that these arguments over regulations are not new. There's no need to discuss them at the level of theory and platitudes. There's a long historical record. Conservatives and the industries they've allied with have been wrong in their dire predictions about the consequence of regulations, again and again and again.</p> \n<p>The Cry Wolf Project has an amazing <a href=""http://crywolfproject.org/quotes"">database of quotes</a> recording these apocalyptic warnings — about Medicare, Social Security, the Clean Air Act, on and on. (See also <a href=""http://prospect.org/article/behind-numbers-polluted-data"">here</a> and <a href=""http://grist.org/article/2009-06-26-overestimate-costs-climate/"">here</a>.) Conservatives and industry are wrong every time, in the same way, often using the exact same language. That spectacular record of failure ought to inform our assessment of current debates.</p> \n<p>I've always wanted politicians to make this point more squarely, and Obama did, at length:</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>We've  heard these same stale arguments before.  Every time America has made  progress, it's been despite these kind of claims.  Whenever  America has set clear rules and smarter standards for our air, our water, our children’s health, we get the same scary stories about  killing jobs and businesses and freedom.  It's true.</p> \n<p>...</p> \n<p>So we got to learn lessons.  We got to know our history.  The kinds of criticisms that you're going to hear are simply excuses for inaction.  They’re not even good business sense.  They underestimate American business and American ingenuity.</p> \n<p>In 1970, when Republican President Richard Nixon decided to do something about the smog that was choking our cities, they warned that the new pollution standards would decimate the auto industry.  It didn’t happen.  Catalytic converters worked.  Taking the lead out of gasoline worked.  Our air got cleaner.</p> \n<p>In 1990, when Republican President George H.W. Bush decided to do something about acid rain, they said the bills would go up, our lights would go off, businesses would suffer ""a quiet death."" It didn’t happen.  We cut acid rain dramatically, and it cost much less than anybody expected -- because businesses, once incentivized, were able to figure it out.</p> \n<p>When we restricted leaded fuel in our cars, cancer-causing chemicals in plastics, it didn’t end the oil industry, it didn’t end the plastics industry; American chemists came up with better substitutes.  The fuel standards we put in place a couple of years ago didn’t cripple automakers.  The American auto industry retooled.  Today, our automakers are selling the best cars in the world at a faster pace than they have in almost a decade.  They’ve got more hybrids, and more plug-ins, and more high fuel-efficient cars, giving consumers more choice than ever before, and saving families at the pump.</p> \n<p>We can figure this stuff out as long as we're not lazy about it; as long as we don't take the path of least resistance.  Scientists, citizens, workers, entrepreneurs -- together as Americans, we disrupt those stale, old debates, upend old ways of thinking.  Right now, we’re inventing whole new technologies, whole new industries -- not looking backwards, we're looking forwards.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>I wish most journalists demonstrated this much understanding of history. Instead, every new fight over a public health regulation is another ""he said, she said,"" claim and counter-claim, with no sense of which perspective and arguments have the best track record, no sense that the same fights have played out before in the same way. (Spoiler: Medicare did not prompt a descent into totalitarian socialism.)</p> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""3934606""><img src=""https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3934606/history%20of%20corporate%20whining.png""></div> \n<h3>3) We're all, like, one human family, man</h3> \n<p>Climate change is a global problem. Every ton of greenhouse gases emitted affects the whole atmosphere and all human beings; conversely, every ton of emissions prevented or avoided benefits all human beings. The only way to coherently address climate change is to do so together, <em>as a species</em>.</p> \n<p>This kind of thing does not come naturally to us, to say the least. We have been shaped by centuries of evolution and socialization to be tribal creatures, to think in terms of us and them, not some universal us. But for very concrete, pragmatic reasons, climate change requires us to take the hippies seriously and start thinking as a human family.</p> \n<p>Of course, for a given country it's possible to sell the climate effort on its national benefits — jobs, cleaner air, and the like — and that is Obama's main focus, as it is for any national leader. But to get the scale of action needed, there's going to need to be at least some element of global solidarity. Says Obama:</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>[I]t’s easy to be cynical and to say climate change is the kind of challenge  that’s just too big for humanity to solve.  I am absolutely convinced that’s wrong.  We can solve this thing. But we have to get going. <strong>It's  exactly the kind of challenge that's big enough to remind us that we’re  all in this together.</strong></p> \n<p>Last month, for the first time since 1972, NASA released a ""blue marble,"" a single snapshot of the Earth taken from outer space.  And so much has  changed  in the decades between that first picture and the second.  Borders have  shifted, generations have come and gone, our global population has nearly doubled.  But one thing hasn’t changed -- our planet is as beautiful as ever. It still looks blue. And it's  as vast, but also as fragile, as miraculous, as anything in this  universe.</p> \n<p>This  ""blue marble"" belongs to all of us. It belongs to these kids who are here.  There are more than 7 billion people alive today; no matter what  country  they’re from, no matter what language they speak, every one of them can  look at this image and say, ""That’s my home.""</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Imagine all the people, sharing all the world ...</p> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""3934614"">\n<img src=""https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3934614/bluemarble_2014.jpg""> \n<div class=""caption""> \n<p>The famed blue marble.</p> \n</div> \n</div> \n<p>This kind of sentiment doesn't get much play in politics. Nationalism and xenophobia have a far more robust history, and it remains far easier to activate people with fear than with fellow-feeling.

How Chuck Schumer could sink the Iran nuclear deal,http://www.vox.com/2015/8/5/9101063/chuck-schumer-iran-deal,The pro-Israel senator is perhaps the chief decision-maker on the deal right now.,"<p>Officially, Barack Obama is still the president of the United States, but watching the politics around the Iran nuclear deal, you might get the impression that Sen. Chuck Schumer is leading the free world this week.</p> \n<p>The reason is this: Schumer has become perhaps the most important person in deciding whether the Iran deal can get past Congress. If two-thirds or more of each house of Congress votes to oppose the Iran deal, that would kill it. If they don't, the deal will proceed.</p> \n<p>That means the vote is effectively decided by a <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/07/14/whip-count-where-the-senate-stands-on-the-iran-deal/"">relatively small number</a> of Democrats who could vote either way. Of those swing votes, Schumer is probably the most important and most influential. He is a pro-Israel Democrat from New York. He is also very important in both his party and in the Senate, where he will take over as Democratic leader after 2016.</p> \n<p>So what Schumer does here matters a great deal. He insists he is still undecided, but there are plenty of tea leaves to read suggesting he has already made up his mind (the tea leaves, as they often do, offer contradictory guidance on which way he'll vote). Here's why Chuck Schumer is your de facto president on the Iran deal for the moment, what it means, and what we know about how he'll vote.</p> \n<h3>Why Chuck decides</h3> \n<p>Congress, my colleague Andrew Prokop has written, will <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/7/14/8959807/iran-deal-congress"">probably not kill</a> the Iran deal. It would require a lot of Democrats to vote against their president on his legacy foreign policy achievement, which is possible but seems unlikely.</p> \n<p>So assume that the most likely, default scenario is that Congress makes a big deal out of passing a measure formally disapproving of the Iran deal. Obama will veto it, and then Congress will fail to secure the necessary two-thirds majority to override his veto.</p> \n<p>This way, Congress doesn't have to own the nuclear deal (""we voted against it!""), thus allowing them to avoid any blame if the deal turns out to be a disaster. But they can also avoid killing the deal, which would require them to take the blame for any consequences that causes.</p> \n<p>The whole thing is perfectly constructed to give Congress just enough of a role to avoid political blame without requiring substantive foreign policy contributions. However, there is one way in which those incentives might get screwy: If it starts to look like Congress is going to get the two-thirds majority to kill the deal after all, and if it looks like killing the deal will become politically popular, then lawmakers will have an incentive to join the ""winning side"" and vote against the deal.</p> \n<p>If it does happen, the road to such an outcome almost certainly runs through Chuck Schumer's office. Schumer turning against the Iran deal is probably the one thing that would be most likely to open a floodgate of Democratic opposition.</p> \n<h3>How Chuck could make or break the Iran deal</h3> \n<p>If Schumer votes to oppose the deal, that will send a signal to other Democrats that it's safe for them to oppose the deal as well. Somewhat freed from the bonds of party loyalty, many might do that, especially in the Senate; the deal is controversial, and no one wants to take the blame if it falls apart or becomes politically toxic.</p> \n<p>A Schumer ""no"" vote would also make it harder for Democrats to take a stand in support of the deal. Schumer has strong ""pro-Israel"" credentials. If this prominent Democrat comes out and declares the deal bad for Israel, other Democrats are going to feel pressure not to contradict him.</p> \n<p>A Schumer endorsement of the deal would have the opposite effect. Other Democratic senators are going to be less likely to defy both their president <em>and</em> their soon-to-be Senate leadership. Schumer's pro-Israel credentials make it easier for Dems to support the deal and position themselves as pro-Israel as well. And the fact that he has held out his decision for so long — thus positioning himself as the cautious skeptic — means that if he ultimately comes around, the political narrative will be ""even well-known Iran deal skeptic Chuck Schumer is convinced."" That will provide some real political momentum.</p> \n<p>In either scenario, this really boils down to two issues: political taboos (you don't defy your president on a major issue ... unless everyone is doing it) and inevitability (people will want to avoid a politically painful vote against the crowd). Schumer, more than anyone, can set both of those.</p> \n<h3>So which way is Chuck leaning?</h3> \n<p>Schumer insists that he hasn't decided. But, clearly relishing how important this has made him, he's dropped a number of hints. Almost all of those hints have to do with whether or not the nuclear deal is on-net good for Israel, an issue that Schumer by all appearances earnestly and deeply cares about, and on which he tends to lean in a more conservative direction.</p> \n<p>The evidence that Schumer will oppose the deal was amassed in a <a href=""http://www.politico.com/story/2015/08/schumer-nuclear-iran-deal-new-york-democrat-120912.html"">recent Politico story</a>,  based on interviews with mostly (but not entirely) anonymous sources on Capitol Hill who think he'll vote no. One of the on-record sources was Sen. Joe Manchin, a West Virginia Democrat, who pointed out that if Schumer wanted the deal to pass he would have started lobbying for it months ago. Holding out creates a sense of political controversy, and has left space for a few other Democrats to publicly come out against the deal.</p> \n<p>The case that Schumer will support the deal tends to center on a <a href=""http://nypost.com/2015/07/29/a-sign-that-chuck-schumer-will-back-the-iran-deal/"">private June meeting</a> Schumer held with a conservative Jewish group, the Orthodox Union, which was filmed (apparently covertly) on a cellphone camera. In the meeting, Schumer constructed an elaborate argument for how he thought about the Iran deal. Here is <a href=""http://nypost.com/2015/07/29/a-sign-that-chuck-schumer-will-back-the-iran-deal/"">how Seth Lipsky wrote it up</a>:</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>He imagined a hypothetical agreement that had a 95 percent chance of ensuring that Iran would not get an A-bomb.</p> \n<p>""If you are president of the United States, president of one of the European countries or an American, an average American, you say that’s pretty good to me,"" he said. But since a nuclear Iran would be an existential threat to Israel, he suggested, there’s another perspective.</p> \n<p>""If you’re prime minister of Israel or an Israeli citizen or for that matter an American Jew or at least some American Jews,"" he said, ""you say I can’t live with a 5 percent chance that Israel will be annihilated."" So ""there is a basic difference in viewpoint.""</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>As Lipsky says, this sounds like a case to make if you're trying to prime your audience to see why you might support the Iran deal. The theory of the deal he described is not really correct — the odds of Iran getting a bomb in the absence of a nuclear deal are almost certainly much higher — but that's not the point. The point is that his talk sounded like it was designed to use pro-Israel language that would suggest sympathy for Israel and its criticisms of the deal, but still ultimately come down in favor of supporting it.</p> \n<p>And then there is the third option: that Schumer will vote against the nuclear deal, but only as a symbolic gesture, and only if he knows that Congress won't kill the deal.</p> \n<p>That's what <a href=""http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2015/08/more-signs-that-the-iran-deal-is-going-through/400508/?utm_source=SFTwitter"">James Fallows thinks</a> will happen:</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>Schumer doesn’t put it this way, but obviously he is hoping that one of those spare votes [against a deal that otherwise passes] will be his. His life will be easier in many ways—in minimizing hassle during his upcoming reelection run in New York, and thus maximizing his efforts to help other Democratic candidates so that he has a chance of becoming Senate majority rather than minority leader—if he doesn’t have to spend time explaining away a vote <em>for</em> the deal to his conservative and AIPAC-aligned constituents. If the deal goes through despite Schumer’s opposition, people who support the deal won’t care, and those who oppose it can blame evil Barack rather than valiant Chuck.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>This theory would certainly help explain why Schumer has held out for so long. If he wanted to be a champion for the deal, he would've announced his support already. If he wanted to kill it, he would've announced his opposition early, before other on-the-fence Democrats came out in support. Holding back makes sense if he does not actually want to determine the vote's outcome, something he could have played a much larger role in doing. It makes sense, more specifically, if he wants to vote against the deal, or cast an ostentatiously hesitant vote for it, but does not want it to actually fail.</p> \n<p>I can't say for sure that I know which way he's leaning. But it does seem likely that whatever he'll do, he may have already reached his decision on it. Yesterday, Senate Democrats held a meeting on the details of the Iran deal with ambassadors from the six world powers that negotiated the deal. It was exactly the sort of meeting you'd want to attend if you were a Senate Democrat who was on the fence.

It's time to start paying attention.,"<p>There's a huge election happening as we speak, and it has nothing to do with Donald Trump. Instead, it's America's neighbors to the north who are going to the polls today in a campaign that officially launched the week of the first Republican debate and is now over.</p> \n<p>Topping the polls right now is Justin Trudeau and his Liberal Party, which is enjoying a stunning renaissance after a near-death experience that as recently as six weeks ago looked like it might be setting the party on a course for oblivion.</p> \n<h3>1) What is Canada?</h3> \n<p>Like so many of the world's other trouble spots, Canada is an artifact of British imperialism cobbled together without regard for geography, linguistics, or religion.</p> \n<p>The product of a mid-19th-century merger between a couple of British colonies and some land conquered from France, Canada remains a land divided both regionally and linguistically. Slightly more than one-fifth of Canadians speak French as their mother tongue, and tend to align themselves politically with the more left-wing currents associated with France rather than the English-speaking world. Anglophone Canadians are themselves divided between the poor provinces of Atlantic Canada, the industrial and metropolitan core in Ontario, and the resource-intensive economy of the west.</p> \n<p>Canada also contains a significant population of First Nations people, who are not quite as politically disenfranchised as their American counterparts, as well as the vast and largely empty spaces of the Yukon and Northwest Territories.</p> \n<p>But the current election, in many ways, marks the <em>muting</em> of ethnic and regional tensions that dominated Canadian politics from the mid-'80s to the early 21st century. Both Quebec separatism and western-specific grievance politics have vanished as forces in Canadian politics, giving way to a more straightforward left-right ideological conflict.</p> \n<h3><span>2) Who is running in this election?</span></h3> \n<p>There are three major parties contesting the election:</p> \n<p><b>1) The Conservative Party of Canada</b> has only existed in its current form since 2003, but has governed since 2006. Stephen Harper is the only CPC prime minister — indeed, the only CPC leader — in Canadian history, and he is running for yet another term. He's been in office for a long time, but his first couple of ministries were minority governments in which the Conservatives were the biggest party but couldn't pass bills without some support from one of the opposition parties. That necessity made it easier to bridge gaps between his party's more centrist and right wings, which hasn't been the case since they won a majority in 2011.</p> \n<p>Harper is hurt by a Canadian economy that suffers from low global commodity prices, and by the inevitable staleness that comes from serving in office this long. He is helped by a badly divided opposition.</p> \n<p><b>2) The New Democrat Party</b> is the official opposition in the current Parliament and stands as an analog to the Labour Party in the UK or a social democratic party in continental Europe.</p> \n<p>The New Democrats stand for left-wing politics and an alliance with labor unions. Traditionally, they've been a small third party — active in provincial politics in a handful of places but never in serious contention to lead the Canadian federal government. Their strategy for influencing policy has been to try to win some seats in Parliament and then hope that nobody has enough seats to hold an absolute majority. Under those circumstances, even a relatively small bloc of NDPers could push policy one way or the other.</p> \n<p>This all changed in the 2011 election, which saw political support for the separatist Bloc Québécois vanish, suddenly leading to the election of a huge clutch of New Democrats from French-speaking districts (""ridings,"" as they are called in Canadian). That helped boost the NDP into an unprecedented second-place finish, which laid the foundation for the party to define itself as the real alternative to Harper — a quest in which it was successful early in the campaign but appears to have fallen short in October.</p> \n<p><b>3) The Liberal Party of Canada </b>has traditionally been the dominant party of Canadian politics and features a wishy-washy center-left ideological positioning similar to that of the moderate wing of the US Democratic Party.</p> \n<p>But the Liberals have also traditionally been the party of Canadian bilingualism and binationalism. It's the party that Quebecois who don't favor independence vote for, and the party that in English Canada stands for the principle that Francophone Canadians deserve recognition as a distinct and co-equal society within Canada. The high salience of regional and linguistic politics in the 1990s greatly advantaged the Liberals by fracturing non-Liberals into multiple parties — Jeffrey Simpson, an influential Canadian journalist, labeled this era a <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/The-Friendly-Dictatorship-Jeffrey-Simpson/dp/0771080786"">""friendly dictatorship""</a> — but the unification of two different center-right parties into the Conservative Party of Canada and the rise of the NDP have left it squeezed in the middle.</p> \n<h3>3) What time is the Canadian election?</h3> \n<p>The Canadian federal election will be held on October 19, 2015. The 11-week span between the August 2 beginning of the campaign and the October 19 election is the longest in Canadian history.</p> \n<h3>4) Wait, 11 weeks is considered a long campaign?</h3> \n<p>Yes. In most democracies outside the United States of America, it is traditional to take long — years-long, in fact — breaks between election campaigns so that members of the legislature can focus on legislative work, government ministers can focus on governing, and opposition party leaders can work on their alternative program. Actual campaigns take place during bounded periods of time.</p> \n<p>In Canada, the way it works is that while Parliament is sitting, there is no election. A campaign begins when the governor general (the largely ceremonial head of state who serves as the queen's representative in Canada) dissolves Parliament at the request of the prime minister. Dissolution of Parliament could be invoked as a response to some political crisis, but in the case of the 2015 Canadian federal election it was done in advance of a scheduled election. The campaign is going to be long because Prime Minister Stephen Harper dissolved Parliament well in advance of the scheduled election, a perfectly legal but somewhat norm-violating move.</p> \n<h3>5) This is a lot of Canada talk, where's my music break?</h3> \n<p>My personal favorite Canadian song is ""Your Ex-Lover Is Dead"" by Stars, which deals with such Canadian themes as heartbreak, longing, and the struggle to pronounce the French word for ""bridge.""</p> \n<p><iframe width=""420"" height=""315"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/r5Or6-HOveg"" frameborder=""0""></iframe></p> \n<p>Canada's music industry thrives in part due to protectionist regulations demanding that Canadian broadcast media dedicate a certain share of their time to ""Canadian content"" (what that means exactly is <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_content"">spelled out in complicated regulations</a>), thus ensuring that Canadian artists always have a local toehold and aren't drowned out by Americans. This <a href=""https://youtu.be/4I-pSO9_EMg"">weird video mashing up a Drake song</a> with videos of Canadian ""heritage minutes"" is arguably more archetypically Canadian than the Stars tune, since it involves both Drake and Inuit.</p> \n<h3>6) Why did Harper want such a long election?</h3> \n<p>Typically, a campaign would be short for one of two reasons. Either it is called in response to a crisis, so it has to be short, or else it's been called at what the prime minister thinks will be an advantageous moment, so he wants it to be short.</p> \n<p>But in this case, Harper was going to have to run for reelection during a tough 2015 economic climate driven by global commodity prices, so there was no ideal timing. Meanwhile, a long campaign serves the interests of the Conservative Party because of the way the Canadian campaign finance system works.</p> \n<p>Spending during an election season is restricted, but parties can spend more in longer campaigns than in short ones. Yet beyond legal restrictions, the parties are also limited by their ability to raise funds. The Conservatives have a much more robust fundraising capacity, and thus a long campaign with a high spending cap gives them an advantage. The Liberals and the NDP hoarded their resources to run ads in the closing weeks of the campaign. The Conservatives ruled the airwaves singlehandedly early on, but failed to really turn this to their advantage.</p> \n<h3><span>7) I'm not Canadian — should I care about this at all?</span></h3> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""3945702""><img src=""https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3945702/935px-US_trade_final-01.svg.png""></div> \n<p>Well, I bothered to write this, so obviously I think you should.</p> \n<p>Here are a few reasons why:</p> \n<ul> \n<li>Even though nobody talks about it, the US-Canada economic relationship is extremely important, and Canada — not China or Mexico — is our largest trading partner. </li> \n<li>Stephen Harper's defeat would be a rebuke to <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/10/5/9455457/niqab-canada-harper"" target=""_blank"">Islamophobic campaign tactics</a>. </li> \n<li>Last but by no means least, if a Liberal minority government ends up depending on the NDP for support that could have negative consequences for both the Keystone XL pipeline and the Trans-Pacific Partnership. </li> \n</ul> \n<h3>8) Who are the main candidates for prime minister?</h3> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""3946560"">\n<img src=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3946560/479592544.jpg""> \n<div class=""caption""> \n<p>Stephen Harper watching soccer in Vancouver.</p> \n</div> \n</div> \n<p>The Conservatives are running the incumbent, Stephen Harper, who is also the only person to have ever been a Conservative Party of Canada candidate for prime minister. Throughout the 1990s, the Canadian right was divided between the more moderate Progressive Conservative Party and the more hard-right Reform (later Canadian Alliance) Party. Harper came up through the Reform ranks, but spearheaded a merger that involved moderating some of the party's stances.</p> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""3946562"">\n<img src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3946562/151669860.jpg""> \n<div class=""caption""> \n<p>Pretty glamorous for a politician.</p> \n</div> \n</div> \n<p>The Liberals are running Justin Trudeau, whom you may feel like you dimly remember from the 1970s, but you are actually thinking of his father, Pierre Trudeau. Justin Trudeau is charismatic by the standards of Canadian politics, and has a strong family legacy to trade on, but he's considered a bit of a lightweight. He's young, and unlike many of his other colleagues in the Liberal Party he didn't serve in the last Liberal Cabinet that preceded Harper's first government. On the other hand, he is a very good-looking man.</p> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""3946570""><img src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3946570/20083569889_69e2117e7b_h.jpg""></div> \n<p>The NDP's leader is Tom Mulcair, who has a beard befitting the leader of a historically marginalized left-wing party. His predecessor and the architect of the NDP's surge to become Canada's No. 2 party was Jack Layton, who had a mustache. Layton died in the summer of 2011, shortly after his electoral triumph, and it initially appeared that his departure from the scene would throw the party into chaos. Mulcair, however, has emerged as one of Canada's most popular politicians. Unlike the vast majority of his NDP parliamentary colleagues, Mulcair also has some practical experience in government, having served as environment minister of Quebec.</p> \n<h3>9) Who is going to win?</h3> \n<p>I sure do not know. Fortunately, Canada has its own version of Nate Silver, Éric Grenier, whose website is called <a href=""http://www.threehundredeight.com/"">ThreeHundredEight</a> rather than FiveThirtyEight because there were 308 ridings at the time he founded it. According to <a href=""http://www.cbc.ca/news2/interactives/poll-tracker/2015/index.html"">Grenier's poll aggregation</a>, if the election were held today, the Liberals would win the popular vote comfortably.</p> \n<p>Due to possible vote-splitting issues, however, it's at least possible that the Conservatives would end up with more seats. Similarly, while it's possible that the Liberals will obtain a majority of seats in Parliament it's much more likely that they will fall short.</p> \n<p>There will probably be no majority party, the median member of Parliament will almost certainly be a Liberal, and the Liberals are likely to be the majority party in Parliament. That very likely means Prime Minister Trudeau, probably as the leader of a minority government but conceivably at the head of some kind of Liberal-NDP coalition.</p> \n<p>* Correction: An earlier version of this article misstated <i>why</i> a long campaign plays to the Conservatives' financial advantage.</p>",Politics
That time Lindsey Graham crafted a bill to destroy the economy,http://www.vox.com/2015/8/7/9116469/graham-debate-climate,"Climate change was mentioned exactly once last night, and it was ... ugly.","<p>Thursday was <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/8/7/9115255/first-republican-debate-gop-fox-news"">filled with political dramas</a>, not only the main event — <a href=""http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2015/08/trump-vs-the-republican-party-now-its-war.html"">Fox versus Trump</a> — but countless smaller side plots, from the unlikely rise of <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/8/6/9114731/who-is-carly-fiorina"" target=""_blank"">Carly Fiorina</a> to the testy face-off between <a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/chris-christie-scandals-explained"">Chris Christie</a> and Rand Paul.</p> \n<p><b>Update</b>: Coverage of second <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/9/16/9337873/republican-debate-cnn-gop-trump-bush"">Republican debate</a> on CNN.</p> \n<p>If you scroll down that list of dramas ... farther ... no, skip a few pages ... there, toward the bottom ... you will find this sad little episode, the only time during the two debates when the words ""climate change"" were uttered:</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>HEMMER: Senator Lindsey Graham, you worked with Democrats and President Obama when it came to climate change, something you know is extremely unpopular with conservative Republicans.</p> \n<p>How can they trust you based on that record?</p> \n<p>GRAHAM: You can trust me to do the following: that when I get on stage with Hillary Clinton, we won't be debating about the science, we'll be debating about the solutions. In her world, cap and trade would dominate, that we will destroy the economy in the name of helping the environment. In my world, we'll focus on energy independence and a clean environment.</p> \n<p>When it comes to fossil fuels, we're going to find more here and use less. Over time, we're going to become energy independent. I am tired of sending $300 billion overseas to buy oil from people who hate our guts. The choice between a weak economy and a strong environment is a false choice, that is not the choice I'll offer America.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Couple things.</p> \n<p>In 2010, Graham <a href=""http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2010/10/11/as-the-world-burns"">supported a cap-and-trade bill</a>, alongside Sens. John Kerry (D) and Joe Lieberman (I). Presumably he did not think it would ""destroy the economy in the name of helping the environment.""</p> \n<p>Also, it's unclear why ""cap and trade would dominate"" under a Clinton administration. There's no way she could persuade the GOP House to pass a comprehensive cap-and-trade bill, so mostly what she'll be able to do is <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/8/6/9110093/climate-change-2016-election"">defend EPA's Clean Power Plan</a>, in which cap and trade plays only a minor role, as one compliance mechanism among many.</p> \n<p>Graham has not said what his alternative solutions to climate change would be, though  he's apparently ready to debate them with Clinton.</p> \n<p>As for fossil fuels, ""find more here and use less"" is precisely the strategy Obama has pursued. Under his administration, US oil production has <a href=""http://www.motherjones.com/environment/2014/09/how-obama-became-oil-president-gas-fracking-drill"">boomed</a> and US oil consumption has, for the first time in a half-century, leveled off and <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-boon-of-reduced-oil-consumption/2015/06/18/c02c43a4-146c-11e5-9ddc-e3353542100c_story.html"">begun to decline</a>. As a result, under Obama's watch, for the first time in 20 years, the US <a href=""http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/jan/17/barack-obama/obama-says-us-produces-more-oil-it-imports-first-t/"">produces more oil than it imports</a> from other countries.</p> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""3948684""><img src=""https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3948684/oilchart_520_111313.jpg""></div> \n<p>Graham might accelerate these trends (though he won't say how), but he will not make the US ""energy independent,"" because energy independence is a <a href=""https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/middle-east/2013-10-15/myth-us-energy-dependence"">myth</a>. Imports still supply about 40 percent of US oil. Even if through some miracle Graham cranked production up and demand down enough to close that gap ... it wouldn't matter, since oil is fungible, bought and sold on a global market that sets the price. As long as the US consumes oil, it will be paying roughly the global market price for it.</p> \n<p>It's not our consumption of Middle Eastern oil that makes us vulnerable to oil sheiks ""who hate our guts."" The US only imports about <a href=""http://www.npr.org/2012/04/11/150444802/where-does-america-get-oil-you-may-be-surprised"">13 percent</a> of its oil from the Middle East. It's the fact that those sheiks still control enough oil to manipulate the global price.</p> \n<p>As long as the US consumes a lot of oil — and it consumes about <a href=""http://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.cfm?id=33&amp;t=6"">19 million barrels a day</a>, more than double what <a href=""http://www.indexmundi.com/g/r.aspx?v=91"">any other country consumes</a> — it will be vulnerable to swings in the price of oil, which means being vulnerable to the people and forces that can cause such swings. There is no energy independence as long as the US is dependent on a global commodity.</p> \n<p>As for the ""choice between a weak economy and a strong environment,"" it is indeed false, as the past 60 years have seen the US implement regulations that radically reduced local air and water pollutants even as economic growth continued. Also, the association of cap and trade with a weak economy is misleading, as most economists say a cap-and-trade program (or other price on carbon) is the most efficient way to reduce carbon emissions.</p> \n<p>Other than all that, Lindsey Graham really nailed this one. I can see why <a href=""http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/03/lindsey_graham_for_president_the_republican_senator_from_south_carolina.html"">some call him</a> ""uniquely qualified to lead our country to a brighter, cleaner future.""</p>",Politics

Turns out primary debates matter way more than the generals,http://www.vox.com/2015/8/6/9100279/primary-debates-matter-watch,"Even though the generals get all the attention, the primaries are where the action actually happens.","General presidential debates, the face-off between the top candidate from both parties, get people excited about politics. The epic clash of worldviews on a high-stakes, high-pressure stage gets the nation to tune in and root for their party's superstar. But in spite of all the hype and attention, the general debates don't really matter — very few voters change their minds after watching. Primary debates, on the other hand, matter a lot in who will rise and fall in the race for the White House.

This Kentucky coal mining town wants Republicans to stop blocking Obama's aid plan,http://www.vox.com/2015/8/13/9148975/kentucky-town-coal-obama,"They'd like Mitch McConnell to shut up and take the money, please.","<p>One of the more bizarre aspects of the debate over coal is that while Appalachia's representatives in Washington use coal miners and their communities as a political bludgeon, it's President Obama who's actually trying to help them. One small Kentucky town seems to have noticed.</p> \n<h3>Coal mining communities are getting bupkis from their leaders</h3> \n<p>Most analysts now agree that the devastation wrought on Appalachian coal in the past several years has been about cheap natural gas, coal seam depletion, competition from cheaper and cleaner Western coal, and poorly run, debt-crippled companies. Obama's purported ""war on coal"" has at most pushed things along at the margins.</p> \n<p>Yet suffering coal miners are getting nothing from their self-proclaimed champions. Coal companies are going bankrupt <a href=""http://www.wsj.com/articles/patriot-coal-files-for-chapter-11-bankruptcyagain-1431435830"">right</a> and <a href=""http://www.wsj.com/articles/alpha-natural-resources-in-talks-to-obtain-bankruptcy-financing-1436995118"">left</a>, struggling to <a href=""http://thinkprogress.org/economy/2013/05/31/2084391/coal-workers-lose-pensions-as-execs-at-bankrupt-company-get-bonuses/"">renege on their pension promises</a> to those who have given their lives to mines. Legislators from Appalachian coal states, <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/05/us/politics/mcconnell-urges-states-to-defy-us-plan-to-cut-greenhouse-gas.html"">led by Republican Senate Leader Mitch McConnell</a>, have offered nothing but fruitless opposition. They opposed the 2009 cap-and-trade bill, which contained billions in subsidies for coal technology, knowing that the alternative would be EPA carbon regulations. They opposed those EPA regulations and are counseling states to refuse to implement them, knowing that the alternative is a federal implementation plan. They take money from coal barons and pretend that the US coal industry can be revived, which means they don't offer struggling mining communities what they most need: a clear-eyed plan for the inevitable transition away from coal.</p> \n<h3>Obama has a plan to help coal communities</h3> \n<p>Meanwhile, Obama has proposed just such a plan, in his fiscal year 2016 budget. It's called the POWER+ Plan. You can read all the details <a href=""http://www.arc.gov/images/newsroom/publications/fy2016budget/POWER+PlanBudgetFactSheet.pdf"">here</a>; here's a summary <a href=""http://www.wvgazettemail.com/article/20150812/GZ04/150819894/1455"">from the Charleston Gazette</a> of what the plan would do:</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>•  Pump $200 million per year for five years to clean up abandoned strip mines, which could create multitudes of jobs for laid-off miners.</p> \n<p>•  Add $5 million for ""brownfields"" work cleaning up pollution at coal-fired power plants.</p> \n<p>•  Give $20 million to retrain ex-miners and help them find new jobs.</p> \n<p>•  Grant $25 million to the Appalachian Regional Commission for efforts to create new businesses and upgrade water, sewer and telecommunications infrastructure.</p> \n<p>•  Add $6 million more for ""place-based regional innovation efforts"" to spur jobs in distressed coal communities.</p> \n<p>•  Award $3.9 billion over a decade to shore up pensions and medical care of retired miners.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Sounds like a good start. And it looks like at least some Appalachians have taken notice.</p> \n<h3>One Kentucky coal town says yes, please, they'd like the help</h3> \n<p>Earlier this week, the little town of Whitesburg, Kentucky, passed <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/81185680159/photos/a.447003820159.379411.81185680159/10156013852600160/?type=1&amp;comment_id=10156014910645160&amp;offset=0&amp;total_comments=18&amp;comment_tracking=%7B%22tn%22%3A%22R0%22%7D"">a resolution in support of the POWER+ Plan</a>. Whitesburg is home to just over 2,000 people, but it happens to be in the district of Rep. Hal Rogers (R), the chair of the House Appropriations Committee. And it happens to be in the state of the aforementioned Mitch McConnell.</p> \n<p>The resolution is worth quoting:</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>Whereas the Appalachian region of Kentucky is experiencing a dramatic economic transition with the decline of the coal industry, and Whitesburg is experiencing economic distress as coal jobs continue to decline;</p> \n<p>Whereas we believe that the transition to a future economy should be one that celebrates our culture; invests in communities; generates good, stable and meaningful jobs; is just and equitable; and protects and restores our land and water;</p> \n<p>Whereas the POWER+ Plan [many benefits of the plan]</p> \n<p>Whereas the POWER+ Plan has been proposed by the White House and currently sits before Congress;</p> \n<p>Therefore, let it be resolved that the City of Whitesburg supports passage of the POWER+ Plan by the U.S. Congress and encourages Congressman Hal Rogers to see passage of this Plan through the federal legislative process.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Rogers and McConnell could get the POWER+ Plan through Congress if they wanted to.  Will they listen to the people of Whitesburg, to all the suffering coal communities that desperately need help, or will they oppose the plan out of partisan spite?</p> \n<p>Ha, just kidding. Of course it's that second thing.</p>",Politics

The thin green line: fighting fossil fuel exports in the Pacific Northwest,http://www.vox.com/2015/8/16/9155849/cascadia-activism-billionaire,The activists fighting fossil fuel exports in the PNW would benefit from a couple zillion dollars.,"<p>By now, most people are familiar with <a href=""http://www.politico.com/agenda/story/2015/05/inside-war-on-coal-000002"">the story of the Sierra Club's Beyond Coal campaign</a>, which, in addition to blocking dozens of proposed coal plants, has secured the retirement of some 200 existing plants, an extraordinary victory for public health and an important driver behind America's progress on carbon emissions. It is one of the most sprawling, diverse, effective, and consequential citizen movements in postwar American history.</p> \n<p>One important chapter of that story took place in 2011, when a scrappy, underresourced 15-state campaign turned its attention to scaling up nationwide. To do so, it faced the dreary prospect of spending years and untold resources raising the necessary $50 million. Instead, billionaire Michael Bloomberg swooped in and gave it to them. And they were immediately off and running.</p> \n<p>Not only did Bloomberg give the campaign money, he gave it focus, an obsession with data, and what is too rare in the nonprofit world: strict accountability. Grassroots energy was honed and focused by business discipline, and the rest, as they say, is history.</p> \n<p>As it happens, there's another anti-fossil fuel activist movement beginning to coalesce, one that might also benefit from an infusion of billionaire money.</p> \n<h3>The next Beyond Coal, maybe</h3> \n<p>Beyond Coal started in the midst of a coal rush. Today, there's a similar rush on: an effort to use the US Pacific Northwest as conveyor belt for fossil fuels, carrying them from mines and wells in the interior to the coast, to be shipped overseas.</p> \n<p>Atop a region known for natural beauty, sustainability, quality of life, tourism, and advanced-technology jobs, fossil fuel industries propose to lay a skein of heavy new rail lines, pipelines, and export terminals. Millions of tons of coal and millions of gallons of tar sands oil would flow through one of America's most beautiful places, amidst one of its most environmentally concerned populations, destined to become millions of tons of new carbon emissions, putting climate safety further out of reach.</p> \n<p>But just as the coal rush sparked resistance, so has the rush to make the PNW a major hub for carbon energy export. Environmentalists have made common cause with local community and tribal groups to fight the proposals on all fronts: in city council meetings, in courts, in legislatures, and in the media.</p> \n<p>Eric de Place of the indispensable Sightline Institute has published a <a href=""http://daily.sightline.org/2015/08/13/the-thin-green-line-is-stopping-coal-and-oil-in-their-tracks/"">list of 18 fossil fuel export projects</a> proposed for the PNW that have been delayed or canceled. They have run into trouble for a variety of reasons, but in every case organized citizen action has helped, sometimes decisively.</p> \n<p>Sightline calls this new movement <a href=""http://www.sightline.org/research/graphics/infographic-the-thin-green-line/"">""the thin green line,""</a> and given how fast it's had to scramble, the power and number of its enemies, and its chronic lack of resources, it has been remarkably successful so far.</p> \n<p>But as de Place says, the next few years are crucial, as ""it is likely that in 2015 and 2016, the Northwest will face yet another tsunami of export schemes as new developments in the energy industry make available light hydrocarbon fuels and petrochemicals in unprecedented volumes.""</p> \n<p>The stakes could not be higher:</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>Sitting squarely astride the most economical and, in some cases, the only possible path from the vast energy reserves in the interior of North America to the world’s fastest growing energy markets in Asia, decisionmakers in the Northwest are in an unprecedented position. To a large extent, Cascadia now will call the shots for the western coal industry, huge swaths of fracked oil and gas development, and Canadian tar sands extraction—to say nothing of the global climate implications of <a href=""http://www.sightline.org/research/graphics/five-keystone-xls/"">unleashing five Keystone XLs’ worth of carbon fuels</a> into foreign markets.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>To hold firm against the oncoming tsunami, the thin green line will need resources. It will need focus, an obsession with data, and strict accountability. Gosh, where could it get those?</p> \n<h3>A chance to out-Bloomberg Bloomberg</h3> \n<p>Of course, if a public-minded billionaire did want to swoop in and help, it wouldn't be nearly as straightforward as Bloomberg's gift to Beyond Coal. There's not a single organization running things in the PNW, fully staffed and ready to go, like there was in the anti-coal movement. It might mean creating a new organization; it might mean creating some kind of formal coalition; it might mean picking a group to expand. A gift would require careful thought, good advisers, and plenty of discipline and persistence.</p> \n<p>But the opportunity is there. This is the next big carbon fight on the ground, the last chance US coal companies have to survive and the key to making North American oil sands and fracking profitable in the long term. Winning this fight, in the wake of Beyond Coal's success, would send an unmistakable signal: Fossil fuels are no longer safe in the US. Invest elsewhere.</p> \n<p>So if there are any do-gooder billionaires out there feeling competitive toward Bloomberg, well, here's your chance to do him one better.</p>",Politics
Climate wonks focus on economics. They need to pay more attention to politics.,http://www.vox.com/2015/8/20/9179001/clean-energy-political-economy,Enough with the economic models. Time to get a better understanding of power.,"<p>Citi GPS (a research arm of Citibank) has issued a <a href=""https://ir.citi.com/hsq32Jl1m4aIzicMqH8sBkPnbsqfnwy4Jgb1J2kIPYWIw5eM8yD3FY9VbGpK%2Baax"">magisterial new report</a> that is both a detailed exploration of the economics of climate change policy and an attempt to answer the perennial question of whether acting aggressively to avert climate change is ""worth it.""</p> \n<p>The report, written by a diverse group of scholars and analysts, digs deep on dozens of issues, including the size of investments needed to avert 2 degrees of warming, instruments for structuring those investments, the merits of various ways of measuring renewable energy costs, the proper societal discount rate, who stands to win and who risks ""stranded assets,"" and ... lots more. It's 122 pages of dense, wonky goodness.</p> \n<p>I'll just summarize the top-line findings, though, because I actually want to pivot off of this report to discuss something else.</p> \n<h3>The clean path requires roughly the same total spending on energy as the status quo path</h3> \n<p>The heart of the report is a comparison of two scenarios out to 2040: inaction (meaning a business-as-usual continuation of the current energy mix) versus action (""investing more heavily in low emissions technologies such as renewables, investing less in fossil fuels, in particular coal in power and oil in transport, and investing significantly more in energy efficiency to reduce overall energy usage"").</p> \n<p>The headline findings are twofold. First, ""Citi’s ‘Action’ scenario implies a total spend on energy of $190.2 trillion while our ‘Inaction’ scenario is actually marginally larger at $192 trillion."" In other words, the total energy investment necessary is slightly <i>lower</i> in the low-carbon scenario.</p> \n<p>This is due to three things: First, aggressive investments in energy efficiency reduce overall energy use; second, shifting away from fossil fuels yields a large ($1.8 trillion) reduction in fuel and capital costs; and third, renewables, though they currently cost more on average than fossil fuels, rapidly get cheaper.</p> \n<p>So the action scenario envisions total energy spending rising in the short term, as investment shifts to renewables (though even at its peak, that extra spending never amounts to more than 1 percent of global GDP), but decline in the long term, as efficiency kicks in and renewables decline in cost.</p> \n<p>This chart shows the total difference in energy spending between the action and inaction scenarios:</p> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""3980668""><img src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3980668/citi-energy-darwinism-ii-total-energy-spend.png""></div> \n<p>As you can see, the massive decline in spending on coal for power and oil for transport more than outweighs increased spending on other sources.</p> \n<p>(Wonk note: The report acknowledges that its projections differ substantially from the International Energy Agency's because it assumes a much faster decline in renewable energy prices, more in line with historical experience and current trends. In the action scenario, renewables go from 6 percent of total global energy in 2012 to 34 percent by 2040.)</p> \n<h3>The clean path avoids potentially enormous climate damages</h3> \n<p>The second headline finding is about avoided damages. The action scenario results in about 200 gigatons fewer CO2 emissions than the inaction scenario, cumulative through 2040. Those avoided emissions mean avoided climate impacts.</p> \n<p>Is it worth paying to avoid those impacts? Why, yes.</p> \n<p>Acknowledging how difficult it is to predict future damages, the authors take a median estimate from recent climate science and then compare it to the extra upfront investments required to drive a rapid shift to renewables. Turns out those investments have ""returns at the low point of between 1% and 4%, rising to between 3% and 10% in later years."" Sounds like a pretty good deal.</p> \n<p>(Wonky note: This is likely a lowball estimate, since many of the ""co-benefits"" of reducing fossil fuel use — environmental, health, and social — are difficult to quantify and generally get left out of climate integrated assessment models.)</p> \n<h3>Citi's report confirms lots of other recent analyses</h3> \n<p>So, this incredibly deep and wide-ranging research project has concluded ... more or less the same thing all the other research has concluded: ""The incremental costs of following a low carbon path are in context limited and seem affordable, the 'return' on that investment is acceptable and moreover the likely avoided liabilities are enormous."" In other words, we can easily afford the cost of transitioning to a low-carbon system; we cannot afford the costs of failing to do so.</p> \n<p>As I <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/7/28/9053283/clean-energy-efficiency-money"">said recently</a>, at least directionally speaking, this is the conclusion of an increasingly huge body of research. (The rapidly falling cost of renewables has only made the case stronger.) At this point, those who claim that a clean-energy transition would harm the economy face the burden of proof.</p> \n<h3>Okay, a clean energy transition is ""worth it"" — now what?</h3> \n<p>For years and years, climate analysts and economists have focused on cost-benefit analysis — whether the costs of climate mitigation are justified by its benefits. This remains the overwhelming focus of most climate policy research.</p> \n<p>At this point, though, the pile of research showing that it <i>is</i> worth has gotten pretty damn high. More is always welcome, of course, but at a certain point it becomes reasonable just to accept it as an established fact. Insofar as we can have confidence in the wisdom of a large-scale, coordinated global effort like this — and of course there's tons of speculation and uncertainty involved — we're pretty confident in the wisdom of this one.</p> \n<p>So ... now what?</p> \n<p>After reviewing the evidence, the report says this: ""Given that all things being equal cleaner air has to be preferable to pollution, a very strong 'Why would you not?' argument begins to develop.""</p> \n<p>Hm. Indeed. Why would we not? More to the point, if it makes so much economic sense, why <i>are</i> we not? Why, when study after study has found that we ought to be acting aggressively to transition to clean energy, does actual movement in that direction remain tentative, halting, incremental, and insufficient?</p> \n<p>The report doesn't pursue the question. Instead, Citi being Citi, it turns to ""the potential solutions that financial markets can offer,"" including ""new [investment] instruments, vehicles and markets.""</p> \n<p>And that's fine. Market analysts gonna market analyze. Financial instruments can surely help.</p> \n<p>But actually answering the question ""why would we not?"" requires more than economic models and market analysis. It requires an understanding of <i>power</i>, of political economy.</p> \n<h3>The clean-energy transition will create winners and losers, which shapes politics</h3> \n<p>While the net public benefits of a transition to low carbon will almost certainly outweigh the private costs, those costs will not be spread evenly. There will be winners and losers. To wit:</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>In financial terms, we estimate that the value of unburnable [fossil fuel] reserves could amount to over $100 trillion out to 2050. The biggest loser stands to be the coal industry, where we estimate cumulative spend under our Action scenario could be $11.6 trillion less than in our Inaction scenario over the next quarter century, with renewables, wind and nuclear (as well as energy efficiency) the main beneficiaries.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>As for oil and gas, the story is somewhat more mixed, as I've <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/6/5/8733601/big-oil-carbon-price"">written before</a>. Taking coal out of electricity will help natural gas in the short run, especially in the US. But anything that raises carbon prices at the margins will hit risky projects like liquid natural gas and non-US shale gas first, working its way down to heavy oil, oil sands, and deepwater drilling.</p> \n<p>Point being, the costs of a clean-energy transition fall unevenly, which will in turn create pockets of intense social and political resistance. It's always worth revisiting this immortal quote from Niccolo Machiavelli:</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>It ought to be remembered that there is nothing more difficult to take in hand, more perilous to conduct, or more uncertain in its success, than to take the lead in the introduction of a new order of things. Because the innovator has for enemies all those who have done well under the old conditions, and lukewarm defenders in those who may do well under the new. This coolness arises partly from fear of the opponents, who have the laws on their side, and partly from the incredulity of men, who do not readily believe in new things until they have had a long experience of them.""</p> \n</blockquote> \n<h3>Wanted: a report on climate political economy as deep and detailed as Citi's report on climate economics</h3> \n<p>So here's what I'd like to see: a report as extensive as Citi's, conducted by an equally distinguished group of researchers, about the political economy of the action scenario. Which companies, industries, and governments face threats to which interests? Which industries give money to which public officials, and through what channels? Which industries do public officials gravitate to when they leave office? Which spend the most on lobbying? What domestic and international levers do industries and governments have at their disposal to impede or delay the transition?</p> \n<p>In short, I want a report that answers ""why would you not?"" — a report that canvases potential winners and losers and charts their sociopolitical capacity to accelerate or delay the transition.</p> \n<p>In my experience, popular conceptions of political economy tend to be pretty crude. ""Big Oil buys politicians"" — stuff like that. Not that it's necessarily wrong in spirit, but it would be helpful to both investors and social changemakers to have a more sophisticated understanding of the channels of power and influence involved in the ongoing energy transition.</p> \n<p>I'm not sure what organization could or would take on a research project like that. Political economy is even more volatile and difficult to predict than markets. It would necessarily involve a mix of reportage and analysis, something like political scientist <a href=""http://grist.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/skocpol-captrade-report-january-2013y.pdf"">Theda Skocpol did for the 2009 cap-and-trade fight</a>, only on a larger scale and in real time. (I had <a href=""http://grist.org/politics/the-road-forward-from-cap-and-trade/"">some issues</a> with Skocpol's analysis, if you're into that sort of thing.)</p> \n<p>I don't know who could pull off a comprehensive political economy analysis like that. But someone needs to do it. As I've <a href=""http://grist.org/climate-energy/we-can-solve-climate-change-but-it-wont-be-cheap-or-easy/"">written before</a>, having a model scenario doesn't help much if you don't understand the sociopolitical barriers to implementing it.</p>",Politics
"Hurricane Katrina showed what ""adapting to climate change"" looks like",http://www.vox.com/2015/8/24/9194707/katrina-climate-adaptation,In a word: ugly.,"<p>I don't have a ton to add to the <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/8/20/9183479/hurricane-katrina-anniversary-new-orleans"">retrospectives and analyses</a> prompted by the 10th anniversary of Hurricane Katrina. I just want to make one small point, something that struck me about Katrina at the time and has been on my mind ever since.</p> \n<h3>Why not just adapt to climate change?</h3> \n<p>There is a certain line of thinking that goes like this: Climate change may well be happening, but disrupting the world's economic and energy systems to reduce carbon emissions is too expensive and difficult. Why launch some crazy, probably doomed effort to control the weather? We'll just do what people have always done, which is adapt to the changes.</p> \n<p>Here's <a href=""http://thinkprogress.org/politics/2009/03/25/37070/barton-climate-shade/"">Rep. Joe Barton</a> (R-TX):</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>When it rains we find shelter. When it’s hot, we get shade. When it’s cold, we find a warm place to stay. Adaptation is the practical, affordable, utterly natural reflex response to nature when the planet is heating or cooling, as it always is.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>I suspect this view is fairly widespread, even among people who might not be able to fully articulate it. Trying to prevent (the worst of) climate change by rapidly reducing global carbon emissions is a huge and politically fraught task with uncertain success. On the other hand, humans have always shown immense resourcefulness in adapting to what nature throws at us. We live in all sorts of places with extreme heat or cold; we live in swamps, on mountains, in deserts, atop tundra; we live in places beset by monsoons and tornadoes and droughts. We've shown that we can adapt to just about anything. Why wouldn't we be able to adapt to whatever climate change brings?</p> \n<h3>Adapting to the old climate isn't the same as adapting to the new one</h3> \n<p>The ""let's just adapt"" view has two key problems.</p> \n<p>First is the fact that people are extremely bad at envisioning inclement circumstances they haven't experienced or witnessed. We are generally familiar with natural disasters as rare and extraordinary one-offs. This leads people intuitively to underplay both the severity of the damages climate change threatens and the effort and expense required to prepare for them.</p> \n<p>In fact, if climate change remains unchecked, there will be multiple simultaneous disasters: heat waves, droughts in key agricultural areas, rising sea levels and more frequent floods, food shortages, resource conflicts, and mass migrations. Even if we think it's better to adapt to those things, we are certainly nowhere <em>near</em> prepared at present. Getting prepared will be extremely expensive — <a href=""http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2012/11/11/1176411/adaptation-mitigation-misery/"">much more expensive</a> than reducing carbon emissions up front — and just as politically difficult.</p> \n<p>But the second problem with the adaptation view is the one Katrina always makes me think about. People often imagine mitigation and adaptation as substitutes, different ways of preventing the same amount of suffering. In fact, mitigation and adaptation are not equivalent. One key way they differ is <em>morally</em>. (I once wrote a <a href=""http://grist.org/climate-energy/preventing-climate-change-and-adapting-to-it-are-not-morally-equivalent/"">longer post</a> about this if you want to dig in.)</p> \n<h3>Mitigation is altruistic and universalist; adaptation is tribal and local</h3> \n<p>Put simply, every unit of mitigation (preventing CO2 emissions or pulling CO2 out of the air) helps everyone.</p> \n<p>Carbon dioxide is not a local pollutant like smog. Its only negative effects are global; it holds heat in the atmosphere, thus tweaking the entire planet's climate systems.</p> \n<p>Similarly, the effects of preventing CO2 emissions are not local but global. Any little bit of climate change that is forestalled helps everyone on the planet and everyone in future generations. (For simplicity's sake, I'm putting aside the ""co-benefits"" of reducing carbon for now.)</p> \n<p>In other words, mitigation is an altruistic, universalist undertaking. Jesus would dig it.</p> \n<p>Adaptation is very different. It is not global but local, not universal in impact but highly targeted. A billion dollars of mitigation helps everyone a little bit; a billion dollars of adaptation helps a few people a lot. Specifically, adaptation helps people who have the luck to live in areas that can afford it.</p> \n<h3>Mitigation slows the spread of inequality; adaptation speeds it up</h3> \n<p>Among its other ill effects, climate change threatens to exacerbate global inequality; it will hit first and hardest in countries that are already poor, <a href=""http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2014/11/23/new-climate-normal-poses-severe-risks"">setting back decades of development efforts</a> aimed at raising them to a decent standard of living.</p> \n<p>Mitigation helps prevent that acceleration of inequality. Adaptation does not. Adaptation, in fact, is likely to <em>further exacerbate it</em>.</p> \n<p>One's ability to adapt is tied directly to one's wealth. Rich countries will be able to do more of it than poor countries; within rich countries, wealthier cities will be able to do more of it than poorer cities and rural areas; and even within wealthy cities, it will be the more affluent residents who have access to the most adaptation and the poor who have access to the least.</p> \n<p>It's not just that money can buy more sea walls, drought-tolerant agriculture equipment, private water supplies, and other material aids to adaptation. It's that money also tends to come along with social capital, and one of the most important findings in research on resilience is that <a href=""https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/green/report/2015/05/11/112873/social-cohesion-the-secret-weapon-in-the-fight-for-equitable-climate-resilience/"">social cohesion is just as important as technology</a>. It is the places with strong social networks that tend to have plans, civic institutions, early warning systems, and systems of aid and support that help communities through crisis.</p> \n<p>It is socially cohesive communities, in which people are ""in it together,"" that survive disaster and rebuild afterward. Places without those social networks fragment; their suffering becomes a self-reinforcing cycle.</p> \n<p>Unfortunately, economic inequality also tends to reduce social cohesion, leading to lack of trust and fewer shared resources. So if the people who support adaptation were being honest, they would acknowledge that perhaps the first and most effective form of adaptation is to <em>reduce economic inequality</em>, to create more cohesive communities defined by fellow-feeling rather than mutual suspicion and resentment. That's true on the local level and also on the national and international level, as resource transfers between and within countries will need to rise markedly to prepare the most vulnerable places for what's to come.</p> \n<p>Spoiler alert: That won't happen. The people most likely to be pushing the never-mind-mitigation-we'll-adapt line also tend to be the people most hostile to attempts to reduce inequality.</p> \n<h3>Katrina shows what adaptation looks like for a segregated city</h3> \n<p>Which brings us back to Katrina.</p> \n<p>The debate over whether the hurricane was strengthened by climate change — which tends to be the focus of any attempt to link the two — is utterly beside the point. We know events like Katrina are going to become more common in coming decades. And what Katrina reveals is that adaptation, in this world at least, is a cruel joke.</p> \n<p>The failure of New Orleans to properly prepare for a foreseeable hurricane has been written about a great deal and there's no need to rehash it. One key factor in that tale is the role played by the extraordinary inequality and segregation within the city, which made lawmakers and taxpayers loath to spend money on shared resources.</p> \n<p>So when disaster struck, all of New Orleans's submerged dysfunctions rose to the surface. There was shockingly little solidarity. Wealthier white people fled; poorer black people were trapped. The authorities were grotesquely racist in every stage of their response, nowhere more unforgivably than in the way <a href=""http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2015/8/18/inside-a-post-katrina-police-massacre.html"">police treated dislocated black residents</a>. It was a nightmare in slow motion and an uncomfortable experience for everyone who watched it unfold on television. This was a wealthy city in the wealthiest country in the world. And <em>this</em> is what happens?</p> \n<p>What's it going to look like when climate change brings storms, droughts, and floods to more and more places, more and more often?</p> \n<p>Perhaps New Orleans isn't a fair example. It's unique in many ways, not all of them good. New York seemed to handle Hurricane Sandy at least somewhat better. But even there, residents in lower Manhattan made out a whole lot better than residents of <a href=""https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2012/12/12/rock-d12.html"">Rockaway, Queens</a>. And what city in the world has more social and economic capital than New York?</p> \n<h3>Real adaptation begins with reducing inequality</h3> \n<p>US policymakers face two trends, proceeding in tandem. One is accelerating climate change. The other is accelerating economic inequality and racial and class-based segregation.</p> \n<p>The trends are not unrelated. Climate impacts will put communities under greater stress even as economic and racial inequality make them more brittle and vulnerable.</p> \n<p>Those who oppose climate mitigation in favor of adaptation need explain how they are going to reduce inequality and segregation, not only within US cities but between them, and between nations. Otherwise, their talk of adaptation is little more than a veneer for selfishness: ""We'll be fine; everyone else is on their own.""</p> \n<p>As things stand now, Katrina shows exactly what adaptation looks like: The wealthy escape while the poor suffer.</p> \n<!--  ########  BEGIN VOLUME VIDEO  ########  --> \n<div class=""volume-video"" id=""volume-placement-8111"" data-volume-placement=""article"" data-analytics-placement=""entry:middle"" data-volume-id=""566"" data-volume-uuid=""fedcba417"" data-analytics-label=""A visual tour of the world's CO2 emissions | 566"" data-analytics-action=""volume:view:entry:middle"" data-analytics-viewport=""video""></div> \n<!--  ########  END VOLUME VIDEO  ########  -->",Politics
Grassroots pressure has put a stop to the proposed Exelon-Pepco merger in DC,http://www.vox.com/2015/8/26/9209227/exelon-pepco-merger-opposition,The big fish will not eat the little fish.,"<p>On Tuesday, the Washington, DC, public service commission (PSC) <a href=""http://dcpsc.org/pdf_files/hottopics/FC1119_ExecutiveSummary.pdf"">unanimously rejected</a> a bid by giant utility holding company Exelon to acquire Pepco, the utility that provides electricity services to DC residents.</p> \n<p>Boring as it sounds, it's actually a pretty big deal. As the PSC writes in its summary decision, ""This proceeding has generated more interest and more active participation by parties and interested persons than any other proceeding in the Commission’s more than a century of operations."" It is considerably more important than most PSC decisions, as it could have permanently altered the ownership and control of DC's utility. So this ruling has been hotly anticipated and will reverberate far beyond DC.</p> \n<p>(Note: Exelon and Pepco can still ask for a re-hearing from the PSC. Failing that, they can appeal to courts. And at any time they could theoretically negotiate some sort of settlement with the PSC that satisfies its concerns. So this isn't over yet. But this decision is an unexpected victory for grassroots activists.)</p> \n<h3>Exelon wants to eat Pepco because it needs more ratepayers to pay for its nuclear plants</h3> \n<p>I wrote about the proposed Exelon-Pepco merger in some detail <a href=""http://grist.org/climate-energy/the-exelon-pepco-merger-big-nuke-heavy-utility-looking-for-new-ratepayers-to-fleece/"">here</a>; you should read that if you want the gory details. For now let's just review the basic background.</p> \n<p>Exelon is an extremely large utility holding company, which means it's a parent company that owns a whole bunch of utilities. Some of those are generation utilities, which own power plants and sell power on wholesale energy markets, and some of them are distribution utilities, which manage local grids and deliver power to customers. In ""restructured"" areas like the ones where Exelon operates — about half the country — it's no longer legal for a single utility to be ""vertically integrated,"" i.e., to own both generation and distribution. But it is legal for a utility holding company to own both kinds of utilities, as long as they (wink, wink) keep them walled off from one another.</p> \n<p>Anyway, Exelon, like many utility holding companies, is hurting.</p> \n<p>Not long ago, utility holding companies were buying up generation utilities by the bushel, stocking up on big coal and nuclear power plants. That's where the profits were: on wholesale power markets.</p> \n<p>But then those power markets got all, y'know, <i>competitive</i>. Smaller natural gas plants and wind farms got cheaper and started badly undercutting the profits of those big coal and nuke plants. Suddenly those same utility companies faced declining and unpredictable revenue.</p> \n<p>What to do? In response, utility holding companies have been stampeding in the other direction, buying up more distribution utilities. You see, the revenue from distribution utilities tends to be smaller, but they are fully regulated (none of this nasty ""competing in markets"" business), so their profits are guaranteed and extremely predictable.</p> \n<p>As a bonus, a utility holding company that buys a distribution utility suddenly has a whole new set of captive ratepayers. It's not <i>supposed</i> to exploit those ratepayers to force them to help it pay off its threatened coal and nuclear assets, but that rule is, as they say, honored in the breach.</p> \n<p>And that more or less describes Exelon's situation. Some 63 percent of its revenues are from generation utilities, and 81 percent of its generation output is nuclear. Those nuclear plants are currently <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.wsj.com/articles/three-exelon-nuclear-plants-dont-clear-capacity-auction-1440420101"">getting their asses kicked</a> on wholesale markets.</p> \n<p>So Exelon wants to eat Pepco, which owns three distribution utilities. It wants two things out of the deal. First, it wants steadier, more predictable revenue streams. And second, it wants new, captive ratepayers to help pay off the enormous cost of its nuclear plants.</p> \n<p>Sounds great for Exelon. And for Pepco shareholders. But not so great for Pepco ratepayers.</p> \n<h3>DC regulators have decided the risks of the merger outweigh the benefits</h3> \n<p>As part of the proposal, Exelon dangled all sorts of carrots. To <a href=""http://grist.org/climate-energy/the-exelon-pepco-merger-big-nuke-heavy-utility-looking-for-new-ratepayers-to-fleece/"">quote myself</a>:</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>[Exelon] has promised to keep employment at Pepco at least steady for two years, but it’s promised nothing after that. It has made commitments regarding reliability, but less than what D.C. law already requires. It has offered a ""Customer Investment Fund"" — i.e., a payoff to Pepco ratepayers — that would amount to a one-time bill credit of about $53 per customer (small beans relative to the bounty awaiting Pepco shareholders), but that’s unlikely to offset long-term rate increases.</p> \n<p>And finally, it has promised to ""ring fence"" Pepco, which would allegedly protect the smaller company from any raid on its resources by the Exelon parent company. According to [a <a href=""http://ieefa.org/exelons-acquisition-of-pepco-at-ratepayer-expense/"">report</a> from independent analysts at] IEEFA, ""no independent assessment of the ring fencing provisions has been made and no opinion by an independent party offered as to their integrity and ability to handle a hostile attack."" Plus the ring-fence provisions wouldn’t protect Pepco ratepayers from rate hikes, which, remember, Exelon has conspicuously not promised to avoid.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>The DC PSC acknowledged that there were some real benefits to the merger. Some of the other promised benefits, it said, were ""neutral"" at best (like the reliability promise, which trades on a reliability program that Pepco has already joined).</p> \n<p>But ultimately the PSC judged that those benefits are outweighed by the risks. They are:</p> \n<ol> \n<li>Exelon is likely to raise Pepco rates to help cover the high costs of its nuclear fleet.</li> \n<li>Pepco will be a tiny little part of Exelon, unable to exert much influence over the company's decisions. (In other words, DC loses lots of autonomy and control over its energy future.)</li> \n<li>Relatedly, Exelon is unlikely to care much about, or devote many resources to, DC's ambitious targets for clean energy.</li> \n</ol> \n<p>I have more on all these risks in <a href=""http://grist.org/climate-energy/the-exelon-pepco-merger-big-nuke-heavy-utility-looking-for-new-ratepayers-to-fleece/"">this post</a>, but I'll just quote myself about the third one:</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>D.C. has big green plans. It has a renewable energy standard targeting 20 percent renewables by 2020, with 2.4 percent solar by 2023 (which would involve a huge expansion of rooftop solar). The city’s official <a href=""http://sustainable.dc.gov/"">Sustainable D.C.</a> plan calls for 50 percent renewable energy, a 50 percent decline in energy use, and a five-fold expansion of green jobs by 2032. All those are stretch goals that will involve coordinated effort for decades.</p> \n<p>Exelon, meanwhile, is among the worst utilities on sustainability. It opposes net metering for solar, opposes the federal tax credit for wind (which, remember, competes against its nuclear fleet), opposes various clean-energy initiatives in the Maryland state legislature, and supports guarantees and subsidies for its nuclear plants. Renewable energy <a href=""http://grist.org/climate-energy/a-bit-of-good-green-energy-news-for-your-holidays-courtesy-of-new-england/"">reduces wholesale power prices</a> and Exelon needs wholesale power prices to stay high to keep its nukes in business. That’s a fundamental tension that won’t go away, even if Exelon supports a few token renewable projects.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>So the battle lines here were pretty clear. On one side were Exelon executives and Pepco shareholders, who stood to make out like bandits. On the other side were DC ratepayers and the district's clean energy goals, which stood to get the short end of the stick.</p> \n<p>Virginia, Delaware, Maryland, and New Jersey had already approved the merger, as had the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). The DC PSC was the last line of defense, and there was an extraordinary <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/joan-shipps/how-grassroots-activists-_b_7034086.html"">upsurge in grassroots organizing and opposition</a> in DC over the past several months aimed at swaying its decision.</p> \n<p>While the fight is not over, this decision is an unexpected victory for those activists.</p>",Politics
Tech nerds are smart. But they can't seem to get their heads around politics.,http://www.vox.com/2015/8/27/9214015/tech-nerds-politics,"A primer, for all you nerds.","<p>We live in an age of nerds.</p> \n<p>Sometimes I try to explain to my kids that I grew up in a time — a dark age known as The Eighties — when reading comic books, playing fantasy-based card games, watching <i>Doctor Who</i>, or being really into computers could get you publicly pantsed. There was a clear social hierarchy, and the way it worked, for boys at least, was that the nerds —the kids who had weird, obscure obsessions, who knew everything about something nobody else knew anything about — were at the bottom. At the top were ""jocks,"" the meatheads who were good at sports and knew where to get beer and had pretty girlfriends.</p> \n<p>My kids have no idea what the hell I'm talking about. The coolest kids they know are nerds. Their heroes are nerds. Their favorite billionaires are nerds. Nerds are the ones making the best movies and apps and Vine channels (that's a thing, right?), the ones inventing stuff that changes the world. The archetypes in all those '80s teen movies mean nothing to my children. These days, nerds run the world.</p> \n<p>But while nerds have taken over pop culture and technology, there's one area they haven't mastered: politics. To see what I mean, let's start with an unsolicited phone call from <a href=""http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Elon_Musk"">Elon Musk</a>, the king of nerds, to one of his subjects.</p> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""4004616"">\n<img src=""https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4004616/elon-musk.jpg""> \n<div class=""caption""> \n<p>Laughing at the doubters.</p> \n</div> \n</div> \n<h3>Wait But Why exemplifies the nerd spirit</h3> \n<p>One of the purest expressions of the nerd spirit is the site <a href=""http://waitbutwhy.com/"">Wait But Why</a>, started in 2013 by Tim Urban, a Harvard graduate and co-owner of a tutoring company but really, by his own testimony, just some dude.</p> \n<p>Urban is a nerd. He gets interested in some complicated subject, digs into it until he feels like he really understands it, and he explains it. (To get a flavor, start with <a href=""http://waitbutwhy.com/2013/10/why-procrastinators-procrastinate.html"">the one about procrastination</a> and the <a href=""http://waitbutwhy.com/2015/01/artificial-intelligence-revolution-1.html"">epic series on artificial intelligence</a>.) It's a bit like the explanatory journalism that's so popular these days, but in the case of WBW, it is completely untethered from the web-media demands for speed, volume, and topicality.</p> \n<p>Urban originally promised to post twice a week. Then it was ""every Tuesday."" Now it's ""every sometimes."" He takes his time. But the posts, when they come, are a delight — 3,000, 8,000, even 26,000 (seriously) words, complete with crude but hilarious illustrations, diagrams, and infographics, written in friendly, nontechnical language that still manages to honor the complexities of the subjects.</p> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""4004642""><img src=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4004642/wait-but-why.png""></div> \n<p>A WBW post is like a feast. At the end, you feel sated, like you just learned the shit out of something, like you <i>get</i> something in a way you didn't before.</p> \n<p>Here's a description of Urban's process, from a recent post:</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>One type of WBW post is the ""let’s just take this whole topic and really actually get to the bottom of it so we can all completely get it from here forward."" The ideal topic for that kind of post is one that’s really important to our lives, and that tends to come up a lot, but that’s also hugely complex and confusing, often controversial with differing information coming out of different mouths, and that ends up leaving a lot of people feeling like they don’t totally get it as well as they ""should.""</p> \n<p>The way I approach a post like that is I’ll start with the surface of the topic and ask myself what I don’t fully get—I look for those foggy spots in the story where when someone mentions it or it comes up in an article I’m reading, my mind kind of glazes over with a combination of ""ugh it’s that icky term again nah go away"" and ""ew the adults are saying that adult thing again and I’m seven so I don’t actually understand what they’re talking about."" Then I’ll get reading about those foggy spots—but as I clear away fog from the surface, I often find more fog underneath. So then I research that new fog, and again, often come across other fog even further down. My perfectionism kicks in and I end up refusing to stop going down the rabbit hole until I hit the floor.</p> \n<p>...</p> \n<p>Hitting the floor is a great feeling and makes me realize that the adults weren’t actually saying anything that complicated or icky after all. And when I come across that topic again, it’s fun now, because I get it and I can nod with a serious face on and be like, ""Yes, interest rates are problematic"" like a real person.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>I love that. (And it's not that far from how I approach posts, though I don't have quite the luxury of time Urban does.) One of the best things about it is that by coming to a topic as an outsider, Urban can be mostly free of preconceptions and write without jargon. He learns it with you.</p> \n<p>Getting to the bottom of something, Urban says, allows you to have a kind of base, a tree trunk of knowledge on which to hang new facts and information.</p> \n<h3>WBW takes on energy and climate change and gets it almost all right</h3> \n<p>I bring all this up because WBW recently tackled some issues close to my heart. The impetus was a telephone call from Elon Musk. (How's that for a nerd seal of approval?) Musk wanted Urban to come have a chat, to see if Urban would take on a few topics Musk thinks are poorly understood by the broader public.</p> \n<p>The result was a long interview with Musk and three of the meatiest, most fascinating, most satisfying posts I've read in ages. The <a href=""http://waitbutwhy.com/2015/05/elon-musk-the-worlds-raddest-man.html"">first is about Musk himself</a> — his history, his companies, and why he has chosen clean energy and space travel as his primary areas of focus. The <a href=""http://waitbutwhy.com/2015/06/how-tesla-will-change-your-life.html"">second, a 26,000-word monster</a>, contains the story of energy, the story of cars, and the story of Tesla, from the basics right up through the present. And the <a href=""http://waitbutwhy.com/2015/08/how-and-why-spacex-will-colonize-mars.html"">third, another monster</a>, is about humans and space, Musk's space program SpaceX, and how to colonize Mars.</p> \n<p>I really cannot recommend them highly enough. You will understand the world better for reading them.</p> \n<p>Naturally, I want to focus on the second, which covers energy and climate change. While acknowledging that it's one of those icky, fuzzy, politicized, and mostly unpleasant topics, Urban does a fantastic job of concisely covering the basics of climate change and the need for clean energy. (He focuses, appropriately, on <i>risk</i> rather than what's known for certain.)</p> \n<p>He mostly gets the science and energy parts right.</p> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""4004646"">\n<img src=""https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4004646/wbw-climate.png""> \n<div class=""caption""> \n<p>A pithy summary.</p> \n</div> \n</div> \n<p>The one problem I had with the post is in its treatment of <i>politics</i>, which to me illustrates some fairly common nerd shortcomings on that subject.</p> \n<p>Indeed, politics is one area where the general science/tech nerd ethos has not exactly covered itself in glory (I'm looking at you, <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/8/26/9210417/lawrence-lessig-president"">Larry Lessig</a>). And it's a shame, because if tech nerds want to change the world — as they <a href=""https://youtu.be/J-GVd_HLlps"">say with numbing frequency </a>that they do — they need to figure out politics, the same way they're figuring out solar power or artificial intelligence, in a ground-up, no-preconceptions kind of way. They need to develop that tree trunk knowledge that enables them to contextualize new political information. Currently, they lack a good tree trunk, as Urban's post demonstrates.</p> \n<p>(Note: There are policy and political nerds, of course. I am one, and work with lots of others. But the overlap between that demo and the larger tech nerd demo is pretty slim.)</p> \n<h3>The quasi-libertarian anti-politics of the tech nerd</h3> \n<p>Urban writes, in his post on energy:</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>This is a highly politicized issue, but this post has no political agenda. I’m not political because nothing could <i>ever possibly be more annoying</i> than American politics. I think both parties have good points, both also have a bunch of dumb people saying dumb things, and I want nothing to do with it. So I approached this post—like I try to with every post—from a standpoint of rationality and what I think makes sense.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>There are two broad narratives about politics that can be glimpsed between the lines here. Both are, in the argot of the day, problematic.</p> \n<p>The first, which is extremely common in the nerd community, is a distaste for government and politics. Sometimes this shades over into ideological libertarianism (see: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Thiel#/Political_activities"">Peter Thiel</a>, who wants to build a <a href=""http://valleywag.gawker.com/peter-thiel-s-dream-of-a-lawless-utopia-floats-on-1368141049/1371215728"">floating libertarian city</a>), but often it's just a sense that government is big, bloated, slow-moving, and inefficient, that politicians are dimwits and panderers, and that real progress comes from private innovation, not government mandates. None of which is facially unreasonable.</p> \n<p>The second is the conception of politics as a contest of two mirror-image political philosophies, with mirror-image extremes and a common center, which is where sensible, independent-minded people congregate (""both parties have good points; both also have a bunch of dumb people saying dumb things""). Urban actually has a visual on it in <a href=""http://waitbutwhy.com/2013/10/the-battle-to-lose-independent-vote.html"">another post on politics</a>:</p> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""3997996""><img src=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3997996/wbw-spectrum.png""></div> \n<p>In the next panel, a door labeled ""Registered Independents"" sits square in the middle of the spectrum. The story in the comic is that independents became Democrats in 2008 because of Obama's promises. Frustration with the Democrats would have led them into the arms of moderate Republicans, except the moderate Republicans let extremists talk over them, so independents are staying with Democrats for now.</p> \n<p>I think that these two narratives — disdain toward politics, and the parties as mirror images with rational thinking in the center — are connected. That vision of the political spectrum implies that one is partisan precisely in proportion to one's distance from rational thinking. It <i>defines partisanship as irrationality</i>, as blind, lemming-like behavior, the opposite of approaching things ""from a standpoint of rationality and what I think makes sense."" The independent thinker takes a bit from this party, a bit from that one, as rational thinking dictates.</p> \n<p>Since the loudest voices in politics are partisans, people who have chosen a side, seeing the political spectrum this way is inevitably going to lead to an irritation and disdain toward politics, a desire to wash one's hands of it and proclaim, as Urban does, that ""I am not political."" But that just won't do.</p> \n<p>On other issues, Urban has said that when he really digs in, ""what I usually find is that so many of the topics I’ve pegged as 'boring' in my head are actually just foggy to me—like watching episode 17 of a great show, which would be boring if you didn’t have the tree trunk of the back story and characters in place.""</p> \n<p>I would suggest that American politics is just one of those icky subjects Urban hasn't rolled up his sleeves and dug into yet. He can be forgiven — many political pundits are working with the same moldy frames, to this day. And he won't get much help from his fellow nerds. But it's important.</p> \n<h3>There are no independents, moderates aren't moderate, and the center is corporate</h3> \n<p>Let's start with a few findings in political science that have not yet sunk into common knowledge.</p> \n<p>First, independents are not independent. In fact, ""independent"" may be the second most <a href=""http://themonkeycage.org/2009/12/three_myths_about_political_in/"">myth-encrusted</a>, poorly understood phenomenon in US politics (the first is coming up). The key thing to understand about independents is that they generally <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2014/01/08/most-political-independents-actually-arent/"">vote like partisans</a>. As political scientist John Sides says:</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>They tend to be loyal to their party’s candidate in elections.  They tend to have favorable views of many political figures in their party. They are not much more likely to identify as ideologically moderate. To be sure, independent leaners are not as partisan as the strongest partisans. But they resemble weaker partisans much more than they do real independents. In actuality, real independents make up just over 10 percent of Americans, and a small fraction of Americans who actually vote.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>If the ne plus ultra of rational thinking is switching between parties, splitting votes from election to election, then there are very few rational voters in America. (You can decide for yourself how plausible that seems.)</p> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""4004656""><img src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4004656/monkey-cage-independents.png""></div> \n<p>Second, the <i>most</i> myth-encrusted phenomenon in US politics is the ""moderate."" The popular conception of moderates is that they gravitate toward the political center, splitting the difference between the mainstream positions of the two parties.</p> \n<p>If that's a moderate, then America doesn't have many of those either. In fact, the relative prevalence of moderates in popular polling is almost certainly a <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/7/8/5878293/lets-stop-using-the-word-moderate"">statistical artifact</a>. A voter with one extreme conservative opinion (round up and expel all illegal immigrants immediately) and one extreme liberal opinion (institute a 100 percent tax on wealth over a million dollars) will be marked, for the purposes of polling, as a moderate. What's really being measured is <i>heterogeneity of opinion</i>, not centrism. In fact, most moderates have at least one opinion that is well outside the mainstream of either party.</p> \n<p>Moderates also tend to be more disengaged from politics. More engaged voters will tend to follow the lead and adopt the positions of party leaders. People who know little about the landscape of politics or the mechanisms of policy will tend to support positions outside the mainstream, often positions that more experienced political observers will find ludicrous (for good or ill). A voter with deeply informed, mildly center-left positions will code as ""more partisan"" than a moderate who has ill-informed positions that are all over the map, but that doesn't mean the moderate is more centrist or more rational.</p> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""4004666"">\n<img src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4004666/no-labels.jpg""> \n<div class=""caption""> \n<p>This is the kind of thing you do when you're confused about moderates.</p> \n</div> \n</div> \n<p>Third, in practical coalitional politics, the ""center"" will tend to be shaped not by rational thinking but by money and power. If there is any space left for bipartisanship in US politics, it is around measures that benefit corporate elites.</p> \n<p>The right-wing base has a coherent position on climate change: It's a hoax, so we shouldn't do anything about it. The left-wing base has a coherent position: It's happening, so we should do something about it. The ""centrist"" position, shared by conservative Democrats and the few remaining moderate Republicans, is that it's happening but we shouldn't do anything about it. That's not centrist in any meaningful ideological sense; instead, like most areas of overlap between the parties, it is <i>corporatist</i>.</p> \n<p>The ones talking about ambitious policy to address climate change are mostly out in what Urban has labeled crazy zones. Doesn't seem that crazy to me.</p> \n<p>The previous three points show that the American political spectrum is not composed of two irrational extremes with calm, independent-thinking moderates in the center. But there's a deeper problem, which is that the spectrum isn't composed of two mirror-image sides at all. It turns out the sides are quite different.</p> \n<h3>Republicans and Democrats are different, and the former are more extreme</h3> \n<p>Last year, Ezra Klein <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/9/15/6131919/democrats-and-republicans-really-are-different"">wrote up some interesting new research</a> on enduring differences between the Democratic and Republican parties in the US. Here's how the researchers summarize their findings: ""The Republican Party is dominated by ideologues who are committed to small-government principles, while Democrats represent a coalition of social groups seeking public policies that favor their particular interests.""</p> \n<p>As Klein writes, ""The word 'ideologue' is a technical term within political science but an insult within American politics. There is nothing wrong with approaching politics ideologically — and that's particularly true when you compare it to the major alternatives, which are approaching it transactionally or as a pure partisan."" So perhaps a simpler way of putting the conclusion is that the Republican Party is motivated by a general philosophy while Democrats are motivated by specific policies they want to achieve.</p> \n<p>These motivations, the researchers argue, are entirely rational given demographic realities (more on that in a second), and help explain quite a bit about the workings of modern politics. New policy, even when it's passed by Republican presidents, tends to ""expand the scope of government responsibility, funding, or regulation."" So it's no wonder that Republicans are more content with gridlock and more likely to punish compromise.</p> \n<p>But the differing natures of the two parties often lead to confusion based upon projection: Republicans often assume Democrats are being more ideological than they are; Democrats are often baffled by Republicans' refusal to accept half a loaf in policy negotiations.</p> \n<p>The parties are not mirror images at all. They are different beasts entirely. And it's important to understand how they got that way.</p> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""4004670"">\n<img src=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4004670/democrats-republicans.jpg""> \n<div class=""caption""> \n<p>This stock art is an inaccurate depiction of political reality.</p> \n</div> \n</div> \n<p>In postwar, mid-20th-century America, there was a period of substantial bipartisanship, and it powerfully shaped the way political and economic elites think about US politics. The popular picture of how politics works — reaching across the aisle, twisting arms, building coalitions behind common-sense policy — has clung to America's self-conception long after the underlying structural features that enabled bipartisanship fundamentally shifted.</p> \n<p>What enabled bipartisanship was, to simplify matters, the existence of socially liberal Republicans in the Northeast and Democrats in the South who were fiscally conservative and virulently racist. Ideologically heterogeneous parties meant that transactional, cross-party coalitions were relatively easy to come by.</p> \n<p>Over the past several decades, the parties have polarized, i.e., sorted themselves ideologically (that's what the GOP's <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_strategy"">""Southern strategy""</a> was about). Racist conservative Democrats became Republicans and social liberals became Democrats. The process has now all but completed: The rightmost national Democrat is now to the left of the leftmost national Republican.</p> \n<p>Crucially, however, the process of polarization has been <a href=""http://grist.org/politics/asymmetrical-polarization-the-lefts-gone-left-but-the-rights-gone-nuts/""><i>asymmetrical</i></a>. While almost all liberals have become Democrats and almost all conservatives have become Republicans, <a href=""http://www.gallup.com/poll/180452/liberals-record-trail-conservatives.aspx"">far more</a> Republicans self-identify as conservative than Democrats do as liberal, and consequently the GOP has moved much <a href=""http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2014/06/yes-polarization-is-asymmetric-and-conservatives-are-worse/373044/"">further right</a> than the Democratic Party has left.</p> \n<p>Part of the explanation is that there has been a <a href=""http://www.thebigsort.com/home.php"">demographic sorting</a> as well. The demographics that tend Democrat — minorities, single women, young people, LGBTQ folks, academics, and artists — cluster in the <a href=""http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/the-urban-archipelago/Content?oid=19813"">""urban archipelago""</a> of America's cities. Meanwhile, the Republican Party has increasingly become the voice of white people who live around other white people in rural and suburban areas, where they have been radicalized by <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/7/30/9074761/conservative-media-republican-party"">burgeoning right-wing media</a> and a network of ideologically conservative think tanks and lobbying groups.</p> \n<p>It is not surprising that small-government ideology appeals to people who view government as a mechanism whereby special interest groups make claims on their resources, values, and privileges. Conservative whites, freaked out by hippies in the '60s, blacks in the '70s, communists in the '80s, Clintons in the '90s, Muslims in the '00s, and Obama more recently, are now more or less permanently freaked out, gripped by a sense of <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/24/books/review/angry-white-men-by-michael-kimmel.html"">""aggrieved entitlement,""</a> convinced that they are ""losing their country.""

For a great explanation of why the lurch right has not (yet) caused any widespread backlash, as conventional <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median_voter_theorem"">""median voter theorem""</a> might predict, see <a href=""http://prospect.org/article/no-cost-extremism"">this piece</a> by political scientists Jacob Hacker and Paul Pierson.)</p> \n<h3>And that's where we're stuck</h3> \n<p>The sense among some Republicans that their country is changing isn't irrational. America is fast becoming a majority-minority nation — <a href=""http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-06-25/american-babies-are-no-longer-mostly-non-hispanic-white"">according</a> to the Census Bureau, a majority of children under 5 are now from racial and ethnic minorities — and that has stark implications for the balance of political power.</p> \n<p>Demographic trends are working against the GOP. If they continue, and the GOP continues to alienate growing demographics like minorities and single women, it will become <a href=""http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2015/04/why-hillary-clinton-is-probably-going-to-win.html"">increasingly difficult</a> for the party to assemble a national majority and win the presidency.</p> \n<p>However, for various reasons, aggrieved older white men still punch above their weight, politically speaking. Democratic constituencies cluster in urban areas, where many of their votes end up wasted. GOP demographics are more spread out, covering a larger geographical area, thus giving them a reliably large bloc of low-population states in the Senate and a built-in advantage in the House of Representatives. (That advantage was magnified by the <a href=""http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/gop-gerrymandering-creates-uphill-fight-dems-house/"">gerrymandering of 2010</a>, giving Republicans what is likely an <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/11/upshot/the-enduring-republican-grip-on-the-house.html"">unshakable lock on the House</a> through 2022.)</p> \n<p>On top of that, Democratic constituencies <a href=""http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2014/11/the-great-midterm-divide/380784/"">don't reliably vote in midterm elections</a>, which gives the GOP a huge advantage in those congressional elections (and in state elections).</p> \n<p>So that's where American politics <a href=""http://grist.org/politics/polarization-in-america-is-here-to-stay-what-now/"">stands today</a>: on one side, a radicalized, highly ideological demographic threatened with losing its place of privilege in society, politically activated and locked into the House; on the other side, a demographically and ideologically heterogeneous coalition of interest groups big enough to reliably win the presidency and occasionally the Senate. For now, it's gridlock.</p> \n<h3>You may not be interested in politics, but politics is interested in you</h3> \n<p>What does all this matter? For one thing, it can clear up a mystery that plagues Urban:</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>A lot of people have written about the hidden cost of carbon emissions, and many of them, on <a href=""http://niskanencenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/The-Conservative-Case-for-a-Carbon-Tax1.pdf"">both</a> <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/23/opinion/paul-krugman-conservatives-and-climate-change.html"">sides</a> of the political spectrum, have proposed a logical solution: <b>a revenue-neutral carbon tax</b>.</p> \n<p>A revenue-neutral carbon tax is revenue-neutral because any increase in government revenue as a result of the tax would be offset by an equal decrease in something else like income taxes. This makes it a politically moot proposal.</p> \n<p>...</p> \n<p>When it comes to a carbon tax, the only explanation for not having one seems to be the power big oil has over the US government—because to me, it seems like every politician in either party should be in favor of a revenue-neutral carbon tax. Right?</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Uh, wrong.</p> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""4004688""><img src=""https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4004688/tea-party.jpg""></div> \n<p>I see this kind of political naiveté among carbon tax supporters quite a bit. A revenue-neutral tax is ""politically moot"" only if you envision politics as a kind of ideological grid, with certain sweet spots where all of both sides' criteria are met. It makes sense that every politician ""should"" support any policy in those sweet spots.</p> \n<p>It ignores the fact that the GOP is not a policy checklist but a highly activated, ideological demographic that views Democrats as engaged in a project to fundamentally reshape America along European socialist lines. A coalition that will trust Democratic promises of revenue neutrality about as far as it can throw them. A coalition of which virtually every member has signed a pledge never to support any new tax, ever. (Ezra Klein once <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/wp/2012/09/15/my-fiscal-cliff-fantasy/"">asked</a> Grover Norquist about a revenue-neutral carbon tax, actually. Norquist warned that ""a Republican Party which creates a new tax would not be long for the world."")</p> \n<p>And it's a coalition that draws substantial support from companies involved in fossil fuels and suburban sprawl — though, side note: Big oil is <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/6/5/8733601/big-oil-carbon-price"">less likely to oppose a carbon tax</a> than big coal.</p> \n<p>It also ignores the fact that the Democratic Party is a fractious coalition of interest groups, many of which, especially in key electoral states, are highly invested in fossil fuels.</p> \n<p>In fact, the failure of a revenue-neutral carbon tax to gain support beyond wonk circles (and, uh, <a href=""http://grist.org/climate-energy/what-we-can-learn-from-british-columbias-carbon-tax/"">British Columbia</a>) is the most predictable thing in the world if you have a tree trunk of knowledge about US politics.</p> \n<p>Urban is certainly correct that American politics is annoying. As someone who follows it on a day-to-day basis, I can testify that it only gets more annoying the closer you look. But despite Urban's dismissive attitude, it remains quite important to the goals and aspirations he articulates so well.</p> \n<p>While it may be true that government cannot force major innovations, as Musk and Urban agree, it is still very much the case that <a href=""http://www.pwc.com/gx/en/technology/pdf/How-governments-foster-innovation.pdf"">government can help or hinder innovation</a>. Tesla got off the ground <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/joeharpaz/2013/10/18/tesla-success-fueled-by-u-s-innovation-policy/"">in part because of US policy</a>, including an early Department of Energy loan and an ongoing electric vehicle tax credit. SolarCity got off the ground because of policies like state renewable energy standards and net metering, and has gotten some of its biggest contracts with the US military. The incredible surge of innovation in clean energy in recent years has largely been driven by rising deployment, which in turn has been driven by (inconsistently) supportive policy.</p> \n<p>Urban supports what Musk is trying to do, which is accelerate a transition away from fossil fuels. As it happens, out of America's two major political parties, about a half of one of them supports that undertaking. That half a party is concentrated on the Democratic Party's left flank, over in Urban's crazy zone. Turns out he's in that crazy zone too, but he doesn't realize it.</p> \n<p>The US government could certainly do a better job of driving and managing a transition to clean energy. And if Urban is concerned with cleantech innovation, he should look with horror on the <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonkblog/wp/2013/04/09/three-charts-that-show-the-u-s-spends-too-little-on-energy-research/"">paltry resources</a> the federal government devotes to it.</p> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""4004690""><img src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4004690/aaas-trends-in-nondefense-rd.jpg""></div> \n<p>But politics is about who shows up. The fossil fuel interests that are threatened show up. Nerds like Urban, vaguely repulsed by politics, do not.</p> \n<p>(Actually, that's too sweeping. Bill Gates is <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/24/us/top-us-business-leaders-urge-increased-energy-research.html"">showing up</a>. Google is <a href=""http://blog.ucsusa.org/google-and-epa-clean-power-plan-leaders-and-fortune-500-companies-unite-in-support-of-renewable-energy-769"">showing up</a>. The tech industry is <a href=""http://www.techrepublic.com/article/how-tech-companies-are-propelling-the-environmental-movement/"">waking up</a>. But rank-and-file tech nerd engagement with politics remains sporadic and inconsistent at best.)</p> \n<p>Showing up means dealing with annoying people, many of whom are on your side. It means unpleasant compromises and second- or third-best solutions. But there's no way a new world can be born out of the old one without the midwifery of public policy. Musk may be several orders of magnitude smarter than most politicians, but politics is nonetheless the eye of the needle through which his enterprises must pass on their way to the promised land.</p> \n<h3>Time for for more nerdsplainers on politics</h3> \n<p>There is no subject more ripe for the dissection of an obsessive nerd than American politics. It is ridden with myths and outdated conventional wisdom. And the kind of people who read Wait But Why are among those most in need of tree trunk knowledge of politics.</p> \n<p>Nerds want to make the world better, but they cannot do so without allies in the public sector. They should roll up their sleeves, hold their noses, and try to get a better sense of the complicated web of historical, economic, and demographic trends that have shaped American public life. Only when they understand politics, and figure out how to make it work better, will all their dreams find their way into the real world.</p> \n<h3>VIDEO: How millennials are getting smarter about politics</h3> \n<!--  ########  BEGIN VOLUME VIDEO  ########  --> \n<div class=""volume-video"" id=""volume-placement-4279"" data-volume-placement=""article"" data-analytics-placement=""article:middle"" data-volume-id=""378"" data-volume-uuid=""636db56c6"" data-analytics-label=""How millennials are getting smarter about politics | 378"" data-analytics-action=""volume:view:article:middle"" data-analytics-viewport=""video""></div> \n<!--  ########  END VOLUME VIDEO  ########  -->",Politics
Will California redouble its push for clean energy? It all rides on this upcoming vote.,http://www.vox.com/2015/9/1/9235627/california-clean-energy-future,Big stuff going down in Cali this week.,"<p>It's difficult to overstate how important California is to the US clean energy effort. For decades it has been serving as a kind of existence proof, growing its economy even as per-capita energy use and carbon intensity have fallen.</p> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""4014152""><img src=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4014152/ca-senate-sb350.png""></div> \n<p>Every year, the market researchers at CleanEdge put out a <a href=""http://cleanedge.com/indexes/u.s.-clean-tech-leadership-index"">Cleantech Leadership Index</a>, ranking US cities and states on a range of more than 70 indicators, from renewable energy deployment to VC investment to clean energy patents to green buildings and more.</p> \n<p>Here are the overall top 10 states from 2010 on:</p> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""4014278""><img src=""https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4014278/cleanedge-cleantech-leadership-historical.png""></div> \n<p>California is leading the nation on climate change and clean energy. But the next phase of its leadership is now on the line.</p> \n<p>At issue is a set of bills that would substantially expand the state's existing clean energy programs. The bills will come up for a vote in the California Assembly within the next week or two. The oil lobby has mounted a full-court press against the effort, and a handful of Democrats in the Assembly are wavering. The stakes could not be higher.</p> \n<h3>Oil companies have always hated California's climate leadership</h3> \n<p>California's clean energy effort encompasses a wide variety of local and state initiatives, affecting almost every sector of the economy, but it has always been oil companies that hate it the most.</p> \n<p>To understand why, think of oil companies like coal companies: They provide a commodity. If laws force utilities to clean up, they can switch to cleaner sources of electricity, but coal companies only sell coal, so they're screwed. Similarly, laws that reduce petroleum use in motor vehicles are irritating for car companies, but not fatal — they can make cleaner cars. The oil companies, however, only sell oil. Less petroleum use in cars means they sell less of their product to one of the world's biggest markets.</p> \n<p>Two episodes have drawn their particular ire.</p> \n<p>The first is California's <a href=""https://oag.ca.gov/environment/clean-air/clean-cars/car-standards"">Clean Car Standards</a>, which regulate greenhouse gas emissions from motor vehicles. They were proposed in 2002; the state requested a waiver from the EPA in 2005; after years of delay, the waiver was granted in 2008; and in 2009, Obama took the standards as the template for new national fuel economy standards. The oil companies hated all of that and did everything they could to stop it, to no effect.</p> \n<p>The second episode was the passage of the <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.arb.ca.gov/cc/ab32/ab32.htm"">Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006</a>, or Assembly Bill 32 (AB 32), under the leadership of then-Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger.</p> \n<p>Among many other things, AB 32 established a statewide carbon cap-and-trade system, with the goal of returning to 1990 levels of CO2 emissions by 2020 — around a 15 percent reduction from a business-as-usual trajectory. As of January, motor vehicles are included under that cap.</p> \n<p>AB 32 also established a <a href=""http://www.arb.ca.gov/fuels/lcfs/lcfs.htm"">low-carbon fuel standard</a> (LCFS), which would limit the carbon content of fuels imported into the state. The LCFS is <a href=""http://www.its.ucdavis.edu/californias-low-carbon-fuel-standard/"">in effect</a> as of January 2011 and has survived several lawsuits.</p> \n<p>The oil companies really, <em>really</em> hated AB 32. In 2010, they got a proposition on the state ballot, Prop 23, that would have gutted the law. The fight that ensued was <a href=""http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2010/10/prop-23-ab32-california-climate-bill"">protracted, vicious, and expensive</a>, but ultimately the law survived.</p> \n<p>But the coalition of oil companies hostile to California's climate laws has not dissolved — if anything, it has become <a href=""http://www.bloomberg.com/bw/articles/2014-11-25/revealed-the-oil-lobbys-playbook-against-californias-climate-law%23p1"">more coordinated</a> — and it is now pouring resources into its latest fight, trying to kill a set of bills that would expand upon AB 32.</p> \n<h3>California's latest bid to increase the ambition of its climate program</h3> \n<p>In a speech this year kicking off his fourth and final term as governor, Jerry Brown <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/06/us/california-governor-focuses-on-energy-consumption-as-final-term-begins.html"">called for</a> three ambitious state goals, to be reached by 2030:</p> \n<ul> \n<li>50 percent reduction in petroleum use</li> \n<li>50 percent of the state's electricity to come from renewables</li> \n<li>50 percent increase in the efficiency of the state's buildings</li> \n</ul> \n<p>The following month, California Democrats, led by Senate President pro tempore <a href=""http://www.sacbee.com/news/local/news-columns-blogs/marcos-breton/article27054298.html"">Kevin de León</a>, introduced <a href=""http://focus.senate.ca.gov/sites/focus.senate.ca.gov/files/climate/505050.html"">Senate Bill 350</a>, which would enshrine those three goals into law.</p> \n<p>None would require new government agencies or authorities. The reduction in petroleum use would be administered by the California Air Resources Board (CARB), using ""existing laws and financial resources."" The increase in renewables would come by boosting the state's renewable energy standard, as overseen by the California Public Utilities Commission (or, for municipal utilities, the California Energy Commission). And, similarly, the building efficiency goal would be achieved by cranking up ""existing energy efficiency retrofit funding and regulatory tools"" in the hands of the state's energy agencies.</p> \n<p>Alongside SB 350 were three other important bills:</p> \n<ul> \n<li> <b>SB 32</b> would build on AB 32 by putting in place a statewide target of 80 percent reduction from 1990 CO2 levels by 2050.</li> \n<li> <b>SB 189</b> would create an expert committee to ""advise and inform state clean energy and climate actions"" to make sure they create jobs and benefit the economy.</li> \n<li> <b>SB 185</b> would divest the state's two largest pension funds (CalPERS and CalSTRS) from coal.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>All these bills have already <a href=""http://sd24.senate.ca.gov/news/2015-06-03-senate-passes-california-climate-leadership-billslegislative-package-underscores"">passed the state Senate</a>. They will be voted on in the Assembly in the next week or two, most likely right after Labor Day. When I spoke with de León last week, he said, ""It's going to be a very, very tough battle. It's going to go down to the very last vote."" All indications are that it's <a href=""http://www.mercurynews.com/science/ci_28725373/historic-climate-change-bills-california-legislature-go-down"">going to be close</a>.</p> \n<h3>Big Oil is blitzing against California's latest efforts</h3> \n<p>The headline bills in this legislative package, 350 and 32, have drawn support from a <a href=""http://focus.senate.ca.gov/climate/saying"">large and varied cast</a>. The governor and the state Senate support the bills, as do both the state's <a href=""http://sd24.senate.ca.gov/news/2015-08-26-release-senators-boxer-and-feinstein-urge-assembly-act-climate-passing-sb-32-and-sb"">US senators</a>, as do House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi and <a href=""http://sd24.senate.ca.gov/news/2015-08-28-house-democratic-leader-and-majority-california-congressional-delegation-support-sb"">most of the California House delegation</a>, as do <a href=""http://sd24.senate.ca.gov/news/2015-08-24-release-former-legislative-leaders-voice-support-sb-32-and-sb-350"">nine previous leaders of the state legislature</a>, as do a wide array of <a href=""http://sd24.senate.ca.gov/news/2015-08-27-release-small-business-organizations-continue-support-pro-tem-de-le%C3%B3n%E2%80%99s-sb-350"">state businesses</a>.</p> \n<p>When he <a href=""http://www.c-span.org/video/?327754-1/president-obama-remarks-energy-policy"">spoke in Nevada</a> last week, President Obama singled out for praise ""leaders in California ... aiming to generate fifty percent of their electricity from renewables by 2030 — fifty percent — while cutting carbon pollution from oil by 50 percent."" (That was followed by: [APPLAUSE].)</p> \n<p>Perhaps most importantly, according to a <a href=""http://www.ppic.org/main/publication.asp?i=1159"">recent poll</a> by the Public Policy Institute of California, the public supports the bills by a fairly wide margin. Some 69 percent of adults in the state support both AB 32 and the new bill to strengthen it, SB 32. And SB 350 also polls well:</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>When asked about the targets in [SB 350], strong majorities favor each one. The electricity goal has the highest support (82%), with majorities across party lines in favor. Most adults (73%) favor reducing petroleum use in vehicles, but there are partisan differences: 83 percent of Democrats and 75 percent of independents are in favor, while a majority of Republicans (53%) are opposed. Asked about increasing energy efficiency in buildings, 70 percent of adults are in favor. Democrats (82%) and independents (75%) are more likely to be in favor than are Republicans (52%).</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p><a href=""http://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-pol-legislature-climate-change-20150211-story.html"">Lined up</a> against the bill are Republicans (who are much more likely to represent car-dependent rural and suburban constituents) and oil companies, as represented by the <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.wspa.org/what-is-wspa"">Western States Petroleum Association</a> (WSPA).</p> \n<p>WSPA has a <a href=""http://grist.org/politics/dr-evil-is-defending-big-oil-is-anyone-defending-climate-the-same-way/"">familiar</a> modus operandi: Rather than allow oil companies to be the public face of resistance to clean energy policy, it creates campaign-specific front groups with benign names like ""Californians for Affordable and Reliable Electricity"" and the ""California Drivers Alliance."" This is not a conspiracy theory, it's something the association boasts about — this is from a <a href=""http://www.businessweek.com/pdfs/western-states-petroleum-association-powerpoint.pdf"">leaked presentation</a> WSPA did to the Washington Research Council (via <a href=""http://www.bloomberg.com/bw/articles/2014-11-25/revealed-the-oil-lobbys-playbook-against-californias-climate-law%23p1"">Bloomberg Businessweek</a>):</p> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""4014320""><img src=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4014320/wspa-astroturf.png""></div> \n<p>Here's the ad the California Drivers Alliance is carpeting television with lately:</p> \n<p><iframe width=""560"" height=""315"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/usjtzx-7SBE"" frameborder=""0""></iframe></p> \n<p>These attacks are very much like the ones that oil companies used on behalf of Prop 23, which were rejected by voters and subsequently disproved by events. (California gas prices have not spiked, except after the <a href=""http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2015/04/13/3644173/inside-exxonmobil-explosion-blanketed-town-chemical-ash/"">refinery explosion in Torrance</a>.)</p> \n<p>The California Senate leadership has a <a href=""http://focus.senate.ca.gov/climate/sb350-facts"">sharp website</a> devoted to ""myths and facts"" about SB 350. Among other things, it makes the point that <span>""the best way to shield consumers from volatile gas prices is to reduce our dependence on gasoline."" </span></p> \n<p><span>The cost of electric driving is tied to the cost of technology, and as the market grows and scales, technology will only get cheaper. (It's </span><a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.technologyreview.com/news/536336/inexpensive-electric-cars-may-arrive-sooner-than-you-think/"">already happening</a>.) The same cannot be said of commodities like oil and coal. Their prices will always fluctuate based on factors outside the American consumer's control. The best way to reduce exposure to the volatility of fossil fuel prices is to run electric cars on domestic renewable energy.</p> \n<p> </p> \n<p>On the subject of whether it is actually possible for California to cut petroleum use 50 percent by 2030, it's worth checking out <a href=""http://www.arb.ca.gov/newsrel/petroleum_reductions.pdf"">this fact sheet</a> from the state EPA and this <a href=""http://switchboard.nrdc.org/blogs/smui/yes_california_can_cut_our_nee.html"">longer analysis</a> from NRDC's Simon Mui. In short, it can be done with an acceleration of current policies, but it is undoubtedly ambitious.</p> \n<h3>Democrats in the Assembly are wavering</h3> \n<p>The fight to protect AB 32 against Prop 23 was a historic victory for clean-energy advocates in California. But in politics, it's always easier to preserve the status quo than it is to pass something new. So this fight is different.</p> \n<p>The oil industry's ad and lobbying barrage has a group of around 20 Democrats in the Assembly getting <a href=""http://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/capitol-alert/article32679234.html"">weak in the knees</a>, says the Sacramento Bee, which in turn has ""bewildered activists who once expected a smooth ride in the Democratic-controlled Legislature.""</p> \n<p>(For those of you keeping score: Opposition is being led by council member <a href=""http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Henry_Perea"">Henry Perea</a>, who is putting up a series of amendments likely to kill support for the bill. For some reason, the media insists on referring to the group of oil-intimidated Dems led by Perea as ""moderate Democrats."")</p> \n<p>These Dems can't be seen to side with the oil companies, so they have focused their objections on the authority the bill grants to the California Air Resources Board (CARB).  According to the California Drivers Alliance, SB 350 would authorize CARB to ration gasoline and levy surcharges on drivers based on the amount they drive.</p> \n<p>In fact, SB 350 authorizes no such measures. According to an <a href=""http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/pub/15-16/bill/sen/sb_0301-0350/sb_350_cfa_20150714_101526_asm_comm.html"">analysis</a> of the bill by the Assembly Natural Resources Committee, ""the bill does not change ARB's regulatory authority"" at all. It extends the agency's existing authority. From the SacBee:</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>The ARB, which would maintain its existing – and often controversial – authority over vehicle emissions and fuel standards, estimates existing policies will reduce petroleum use in cars and trucks by more than 20 percent by 2030. Administration officials say expanding that effort to comply with SB 350 could include building high-speed rail, increasing fuel efficiency of cars and providing more incentives for alternative fuels.</p> \n<p>But many lawmakers are leery of ceding authority to the administration to make those decisions.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Originally de León opposed having the legislature intervene in CARB's decisions, saying it would <a href=""http://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-pol-legislature-climate-change-20150211-story.html"">""politicize""</a> the regulatory process. But more recently, he and his colleagues have considered amendments that would address some of those fears, including one prohibiting CARB from fuel rationing and one that would add legislative appointees to CARB. ""Giving the legislative branch more voice in the process,"" he told me, ""is definitely something I can live with.""</p> \n<p>The reaction was <a href=""http://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/capitol-alert/article32679234.html"">unsurprising</a>:</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>Catherine Reheis-Boyd, president of the Western States Petroleum Association, said proposed amendments under discussion at the Capitol do not go far enough.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Somewhat more surprising was this bit of honesty:</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>""We remain opposed to proposals to reduce petroleum transportation in California,"" she said in one prepared statement this week.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>WSPA may cite consumer costs or regulatory authorities, but in the end it's a petroleum trade group, so it doesn't agree that California should reduce petroleum use. No bill that reduces petroleum use will please it, and no amendments are likely to ""go far enough,"" no matter how many studies are done or legislative buffers installed.</p> \n<p>De León told me, ""I have every confidence that once Big Oil's smoke screen clears, the members of the Assembly will see that lives are at stake and choose the long-term physical and economic health of their constituents over the short-term profits of polluters.""</p> \n<h3>The stakes in California's latest clean energy fight are huge</h3> \n<p>There's an immense amount at stake in this battle. To begin with, the passage (or not) of SB 350 and its companion bills carries <a href=""http://www.latimes.com/local/politics/la-me-pol-brown-vatican-20150719-story.html"">enormous implications</a> for Jerry Brown's legacy. It's also a test of de León's political acumen and a moment of truth for the California Democratic Party, which has had almost total control of the state legislature since 2012. If a clutch of Democrats panicked by oil-industry lobbying rejects a bill supported by voters, their own party leaders, and the president, it sends a terrible signal to voters about the party's ability to follow through on its promises.</p> \n<p>Beyond that, if California loses its nerve on climate policy, the effects could ripple. Currently it is one of the few economies of any size (if it were a country it would be the world's seventh-largest economy) that seems to be taking its commitment to the <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/4/22/5551004/two-degrees"">2 degrees climate target</a> seriously. Reaffirming that commitment could influence international climate negotiations, which face a crucial turning point in Paris this winter and are looking more and more to subnational actors like states and cities to <a href=""http://www.usnews.com/opinion/economic-intelligence/2015/02/18/paris-2015-climate-change-agreement-optimism-is-growing"" target=""new"">pick up the slack</a>.</p> \n<p>It could also set an example (yet again) for other states, many of which will soon be casting about for ways to comply with Obama's <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/8/3/9090453/obama-climate-plan-full"" target=""new"">Clean Power Plan</a>. If there is any route to a nationwide carbon pricing system, it's likely to travel the same path as fuel economy standards, which began in California and <a href=""https://oag.ca.gov/environment/clean-air/clean-cars/car-standards"">spread from there</a>.</p> \n<p>For good or ill, the decisions made in the California Assembly in coming weeks will reverberate well beyond the state's borders.</p>",Politics
The line in Obama's climate speech most likely to enrage conservatives,http://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2015/9/1/9241453/obama-climate-responsibility,It's about responsibility.,"<p>President Obama launched an 11-day <a href=""http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2015/08/24/obama-speak-frankly-11-day-climate-change-tour/32265433/"">climate change tour</a> with a <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.ktuu.com/news/news/full-text-of-president-obamas-speech/35027560"">speech in Alaska</a> on Monday. Among other things, he <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/01/us/us-makes-urgent-appeal-for-climate-change-action-at-alaska-conference.html"">said this</a>:</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>I have come here today, as the leader of the world’s largest economy and its second-largest emitter, to say that the United States recognizes our role in creating the problem, and we embrace our responsibility to help solve it.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>That is the nub of climate politics — culpability and responsibility — and illuminates why conservatives have resisted acknowledging climate change for so long.</p> \n<p>Nothing is more repulsive to the nativist sentiment that currently has Donald Trump atop the polls than the notion that America is (partially) to blame for a problem that falls hardest on the global poor — and thus that America has a moral obligation to help the poor adapt to what changes are inevitable and prevent those that aren't. People inclined to build walls to keep out the foreign poor are unlikely to accede to sacrifices on their behalf.</p> \n<p>What's worse, the US has inflicted this harm <em>by getting wealthy</em>, by industrializing with fossil fuels. This connection, discovered long after fossil fuels were enmeshed in the economy, is a blunt reminder of interdependence and unintended consequences to a demographic that has mythologized rugged independence and the untainted virtue of American capitalism.</p> \n<p>Nativist conservatives rebel at any effort to assign the US blame or responsibility for ills in the world, which they see as unpatriotic. That's what all the <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/02/opinion/the-new-history-wars.html"">history curriculum fights</a> are about. Conservative psychology is <a href=""http://www.berkeley.edu/news/media/releases/2003/07/22_politics.shtml"">averse to ambiguity and nuance</a>, so for ideological conservatives America is either God's chosen country, a force for good, or not. Any discussion of American culpability or responsibility is interpreted as an argument for the latter.</p> \n<p>But acknowledging the scientific facts on climate change is the first step in a chain of reasoning that inevitably leads to the realization articulated by Obama. It's built into the structure of the situation.</p> \n<p>That's why the core of nativist voters on the right are unlikely ever to acknowledge those facts.</p> \n<p>Here's the full speech:</p> \n<p><iframe width=""560"" height=""315"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/FvIrlaXU28A"" frameborder=""0""></iframe></p>",Politics
"The controversy over Shell's Arctic oil drilling, explained",http://www.vox.com/2015/9/2/9248593/shell-arctic-drilling-obama,Obama's decision to green-light Shell's activities this summer have put him at sharp odds with environmentalists.,"<p>This week, President Obama has been touring Alaska, gawking at melting glaciers and <a href=""https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/09/01/remarks-president-glacier-conference-anchorage-ak"">making speeches</a> about how global warming is an urgent threat that needs to be tackled ASAP.

How, they ask, can the president say he cares about climate change if he's opening up fresh areas for drilling?</p> \n<p> \n<script src=""//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"" charset=""utf-8""></script> \n</p> \n<blockquote class=""twitter-tweet"" lang=""en""> \n<p lang=""en"" dir=""ltr"">It's literally painful to hear Obama's powerful words from Alaska and know that they're so cheapened by his decision to let Shell drill</p> \n— Bill McKibben (@billmckibben) <a href=""https://twitter.com/billmckibben/status/638688539241246720"">September 1, 2015</a>\n</blockquote> \n<p>This is part of a bigger conflict <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/2/25/8108099/keystone-debate-climate-politics"">that's been simmering</a> for a few years. Sure, Obama <a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/obama-climate-plan/what-are-the-obama-administrations-specific-climate-policies"" target=""_blank"">has taken steps</a> to curb America's fossil fuel demand — through new regulations on cars, trucks, and power plants. But, greens argue, he hasn't shown nearly the same zeal in restricting fossil fuel <i>supplies</i>. The government still sells publicly owned coal in the Powder River Basin <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/7/29/5948561/is-the-us-government-giving-away-its-coal-too-cheaply"">at bargain-basement rates</a>. Obama's wavered over <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/11/14/7216751/keystone-pipeline-facts-controversy"">the Keystone XL pipeline</a>. And now comes Shell.</p> \n<p>The Obama administration, for its part, seems to have a genuine philosophical disagreement on this point. The way to stop global warming, Obama has <a href=""http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/obama-responds-to-critics-of-arctic-drilling-decision/article/2564552#.VVmtp9cXudM.twitter"">argued</a>, is to zero out fossil fuel consumption by developing cleaner alternatives. But that takes time. And in the interim, we're still going to need oil. If we block drilling in the United States, some other country will just drill to satisfy that demand instead. Better we do it, with proper safeguards in place, than someone else. (That's hardly the end of the debate; more below.)</p> \n<p>All the while, Shell is <a href=""http://www.alaskajournal.com/Alaska-Journal-of-Commerce/August-Issue-5-2015/Shell-exploration-drilling-advances-at-Burger-J-prospect/"">now pushing ahead</a>, drilling an exploratory well in Arctic waters. The company has set its sights on the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas, which contain up to 22 billion barrels of technically recoverable oil. It's an audacious plan — and quite risky. Shell isn't expected to produce oil for at least a decade, and even that's far from guaranteed. The area features violent storms, massive waves, and drifting ice floes, making drilling treacherous. Previous drilling efforts have met with disaster. And worse, any large oil spill here could be a nightmare to clean up.</p> \n<p>So here's a look at why Shell is going to such extreme lengths for oil, why Obama gave it the green light, and how this drilling project acquired such outsized significance in the climate debate.</p> \n<h3>1) No one's producing oil from US Arctic waters. Shell wants to change that.</h3> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""4025264"" alt=""Map of Shell"" src=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4025264/ARCTIC_DRILLING_MAP.jpg""></p> \n<p>It's not hard to see why energy companies would be interested in the broader Arctic Ocean. There's a staggering amount of oil and gas beneath those waters (by <a href=""http://www.usgs.gov/newsroom/article.asp?ID=1980#.VecoZyxViko"">some estimates</a>, 13 percent of the world's undiscovered crude and 30 percent of its undiscovered natural gas). And as global warming proceeds, sea ice <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/3/19/8258799/arctic-sea-ice-record"" target=""_blank"">has been receding</a> in the summer, making more areas accessible.</p> \n<p>Even so, no one's really drilled in US-owned Arctic waters since a handful of exploratory efforts in the 1980s and 1990s. It's difficult and costly. There are ice floes, severe storms — and if anything goes wrong, help is far, far away. In recent years, Total, ExxonMobil, Chevron, ConocoPhillips, and Statoil have all put Arctic drilling plans on hold.</p> \n<p>So why is Shell persisting? For one, the company is facing constant pressure to add new oil and gas reserves. Reserves are what determine an oil firm's value, its ability to sell stock and borrow money. And as a company pumps and sells oil from its existing fields, it needs to add new ones. (Back in 2004, Royal Dutch Shell saw its share price plummet after admitting it had <a href=""http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=ahNjS6biqhCc"">overstated its reserves by 22 percent</a>.)</p> \n<p>But finding new reserves keeps getting harder and harder. Most of the world's ""easy"" oil has either been pumped already or nationalized by governments. So private companies have been pushing into increasingly unconventional territory. Deeper offshore waters. Extracting oil from shale rock. Or exploring the Arctic — which, for Shell's US subsidiary, is one of the few frontiers left.</p> \n<p>Shell had poked around the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas back in the 1980s, and its geologists seem confident that there's something there. What's more, says Tyler Priest, a historian at the University of Iowa who <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/The-Offshore-Imperative-Petroleum-Montague/dp/1603441565"">has written a book on Shell</a>, the company's US subsidiary has a long history of pushing the envelope on exploration — it led the charge into deepwater fields in the Gulf of Mexico in the 1970s. <span>""There's no question Shell's the technological leader in offshore drilling,"" Priest says. ""It makes sense that they'd be the ones to take the initial risk.""</span></p> \n<h3>2) So far, Shell's Arctic efforts have been bogged down by lawsuits and disasters</h3> \n<p>Shell's Arctic foray got serious in 2008, when, under the Bush administration, the company spent $2.1 billion at auction to acquire leases in federal waters in the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas:</p> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""4022610""><img src=""https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4022610/Screen%20Shot%202015-09-02%20at%209.27.29%20AM.png""></div> \n<p>But then things got ... messy. Conservation groups, local communities, and Alaska Native groups all sued at multiple points to stop Shell from drilling. They argued that Shell's preparations and spill-response plans were inadequate, forcing the company to propose fixes. Then, in 2010, after <a href=""http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Deepwater_Horizon_oil_spill"">BP's massive oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico</a>, the Obama administration put a six-month moratorium on offshore drilling while it revamped safety rules.</p> \n<p>Shell finally got approval to drill exploratory wells in the Chukchi and Beaufort in the summer of 2012, but <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/04/magazine/the-wreck-of-the-kulluk.html"">that turned into a fiasco</a>. Early in the season, one anchored drill ship, the Noble Discoverer, got dragged by gale-force winds and nearly ran aground. Regulators then barred Shell from drilling deep into hydrocarbon zones after a containment dome, meant to limit the spread of oil in a spill, failed in early testing.</p> \n<p>It wasn't until September 2012 that the company was finally able to two shallow ""top holes"" (the first step in an exploratory well) in the Chukchi and Beaufort. And that's when things <i>really </i>went<i> </i>awry. The Discoverer had to give up drilling in the Chukchi after being menaced by a drifting ice floe. It later caught fire and had to be towed to safety.</p> \n<p>The other drilling rig, the Kulluk, worked for two months in the Beaufort before autumn sea ice started forming. En route to being towed down to Seattle for repairs that December, heavy winds and waves caused the tow rope to snap. The Kulluk was set adrift, the crew had to be rescued, and the rig eventually ran aground:</p> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""4022790""><img src=""https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4022790/GettyImages-159322953.jpg""></div> \n<p>To make things worse, one of the rig operators involved in that season, a Shell contractor called Noble Corporation, <a href=""http://www.adn.com/article/20141219/shell-drilling-contractors-sentence-includes-122-million-fine"" target=""_blank"">later pled guilty</a> to improper accounting and withholding information from the Coast Guard and got fined $12.2 million.</p> \n<p>The federal government investigated and found that Shell had ""screwed up"" (as Interior Secretary Ken Salazar <a href=""http://articles.latimes.com/2013/mar/14/nation/la-na-shell-arctic-interior-report-20130314"">put it</a>) and needed to fix its glaring safety issues before it'd ever be allowed to go out again. The company didn't even attempt to drill in 2013, and its plans to go out in 2014 were rejected. By this point, the company had spent more than $5 billion in the Arctic and still had nothing to show for it.</p> \n<h3>3) The Obama administration now thinks Shell is ready to drill</h3> \n<p>Now Shell's trying again. In May 2015, the Interior Department <a href=""http://www.boem.gov/shell-chukchi/"">gave conditional approval</a> for Shell to begin work on an exploratory well at the Burger prospect in the Chukchi Sea. Shell had an updated operations plan, and regulators had imposed new rules limiting drilling to shallower waters and warmer months. (<span>The Interior Department had also issued stricter rules around blowout preventers, a type of valve meant to protect against undersea oil and gas well explosions.)</span></p> \n<p>Environmental groups were livid at Obama's decision to move forward, arguing that Shell <i>still</i> hadn't adequately explained how it would avoid further disaster. <span>""Our government has rushed to approve risky and ill-conceived exploration in one of the most remote and important places on Earth,"" Susan Murray, a vice-president at the conservation group Oceana, </span><a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/may/11/shell-arctic-drilling-alaska-oil-gas"">said at the time</a><span>. ""</span><span>Shell has not shown that it is prepared to operate responsibly in the Arctic Ocean.""</span></p> \n<p>Nonetheless, Shell was cleared to start drilling the top sections of a well in the Chukchi earlier this summer while moving more equipment into place. Finally, on August 17, 2015, the Obama administration <a href=""http://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-issues-arctic-drilling-permit-to-royal-dutch-shell-1439844581"" target=""_blank"">gave its approval</a> for Shell to drill even deeper, into oil-bearing zones. <span>(In June, kayak-paddling activists in Seattle </span><a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/15/seattle-kayak-activists-detained-blocking-shell-arctic-oil-rig"">tried to block</a><span> Shell's deep-sea drilling rig from leaving port, but the Coast Guard cleared them out.) </span></p> \n<p>So what now? Shell has until late September to work in the Chukchi, at which point it will have to retreat before the sea ice returns. <span>For now, the company is only drilling an exploratory well, which could take one or two seasons to complete. </span></p> \n<p><span>And even if it </span><em>does </em><span>find oil or gas, commercial production still wouldn't happen for at least 15 years. </span><span>Among other things, the company </span><a href=""http://www.adn.com/article/shells-biggest-regulatory-challenges-arctic-alaska-may-yet-lie-ahead"">would need to build pipelines</a><span> that reach the coast and then stretch across Alaska to meet up with the existing Trans-Alaska Pipeline. Shell also has to hope it will prove economically viable to extract the fuel (not certain), that oil prices will stay high enough to justify production (not certain), and that regulations or litigation </span><a href=""http://www.adn.com/article/shells-biggest-regulatory-challenges-arctic-alaska-may-yet-lie-ahead"">won't halt Shell's efforts</a><span> in the future (also ... not certain). So nothing's certain yet.</span></p> \n<h3>4) The biggest worry about Arctic drilling: An oil spill could be a nightmare to clean up</h3> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""4023822""><img src=""https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4023822/480185774.jpg""></div> \n<p>Much of the controversy around Shell's project centers on the risks of drilling — particularly the possibility of an oil spill in Arctic waters. Modeling by the US government <a href=""http://www.boem.gov/BOEM-Newsroom/Risk-and-Benefits-in-the-Chukchi-Sea.aspx"">has suggested</a> that there's a 75 percent chance of at least one large spill (i.e., more than 1,000 barrels) in the Chukchi Sea if oil and gas drilling expands significantly over the coming century.</p> \n<p>If that ever happened, it could be extremely difficult for spill-response teams to get to this remote region. What's more, groups like Oceana <a href=""http://oceana.org/sites/default/files/reports/Shells_Frozen_Future_2_25_14.pdf"" target=""_blank"">have pointed out</a> that many of the usual methods of containing an oil spill — booms, dispersants — may not work as well in icy waters. And, unlike in the warmer Gulf of Mexico, it could be tough for microbes in the Arctic to break down any spilled oil quickly.</p> \n<p>In a 2014 report, the National Research Council<a href=""http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=18625""> warned</a> that current Coast Guard resources ""are not adequate for overseeing oil spill response in the Arctic."" That report also pointed out that much too little was known about the effects of a spill on endangered species in the area, such as bowhead whales, polar bears, or ringed seals — not to mention nearby indigenous communities.</p> \n<p>Shell, for its part, seems to believe it has a handle on the risks involved. In an interview with Bloomberg Business, Ann Pickard, Shell's top executive for the Arctic, <a href=""http://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2015-08-05/inside-shell-s-extreme-plan-to-drill-for-oil-in-the-arctic"">claimed</a> that the company could have response materials, including a containment dome, capping stack, and surface booms, in place within 60 minutes of an accident.</p> \n<p>Obama also seems to believe that the new safeguards his administration has put in place will be enough. ""We delayed [Shell's application] for a very lengthy period of time until they could provide us with the kinds of assurances ... if, in fact, there was a leak that far north,"" Obama said at <a href=""https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/05/14/remarks-president-obama-press-conference-after-gcc-summit"">a May press conference</a><span>. ""Based on those very high standards, Shell had to go back to the drawing board, revamp its approach, and the experts at this point have concluded that they have met those standards.""</span></p> \n<p>But not everyone shares Obama's faith in technocrats, especially after Shell's 2012 debacle. ""Our takeaway from 2012 was that Shell did not appreciate how difficult it is to operate in Alaska,"" Michael LeVine of Oceana, who has been at the forefront of legal efforts to try to stop Shell, told me back in June. ""Now, three years later, without any real public disclosure of what's new or different, we're being asked to trust the same company. That's why the government rush to approve these plans is so disappointing.""</p> \n<h3>5) Obama and environmentalists disagree on whether Shell's drilling matters for global warming</h3> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""4020186"">\n<img src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4020186/obama-alaska.0.jpg""> \n<div class=""caption"">(MANDEL NGAN/AFP/Getty Images)</div> \n</div> \n<p>Then there's global warming. Climate scientists <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/9/22/6805513/un-climate-talks-in-seven-charts"" target=""_blank"">have long pointed out</a> that we'll need to keep the vast majority of our existing coal, oil, and gas reserves in the ground if we want to stay within our ""carbon budget"" and <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/4/22/5551004/two-degrees"" target=""_blank"">avoid significant temperature increases</a> (say, 2°C or more). Given those constraints, environmentalists argue, it simply doesn't make sense to open up new areas to drilling — especially ones that carry so many other environmental risks.</p> \n<p>The Obama administration doesn't seem to buy this — at least not entirely. Officials <a href=""https://twitter.com/Benenati44/status/638797592462270469"" target=""_blank"">often appear</a> to take the view, <a href=""http://blogs.cfr.org/levi/2015/05/13/the-environmental-and-climate-stakes-in-arctic-oil-drilling/"">summarized here</a> by Michael Levi, that trying to restrict fossil fuel supplies is like playing whack-a-mole. If you suppress drilling in the Arctic, someone elsewhere will drill instead, so long as there's demand for oil.</p> \n<p>That means the crucial thing is to reduce fossil fuel <i>demand</i><em> </em>by developing alternatives. But, Obama has also argued, reducing demand won't happen overnight. ""In the meantime, we are going to continue to be using fossil fuels,"" he said in that May press conference. ""And when it can be done safely and appropriately, US production of oil and natural gas is important. I would rather us, with all the safeguards and standards that we have, be producing our oil and gas, rather than importing it.""</p> \n<p>Increasingly, environmental groups have been pushing back more explicitly against this argument, making the case that it's crucial to tackle both demand <i>and</i> supply. See Steven Kretzmann of Oil Change International <a href=""http://priceofoil.org/2015/09/03/a-convenient-lie/"" target=""_blank"">for some counterpoints</a>, including<a href=""https://twitter.com/Kretzmann/status/638781617201381376""> the argument </a>that developing new supplies of oil now further locks us into fossil-fuel infrastructure for decades. There's also the fact that organizing campaigns against drilling can help build political power for climate action in the long run. (An even longer version of the climate case against Arctic drilling can be found <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://priceofoil.org/content/uploads/2015/08/OCI-Untouchable_Arctic_FINAL.pdf"">here</a>.)</p> \n<h3>6) What's next? Hillary says she'd oppose Arctic drilling. A Republican president... likely wouldn't</h3> \n<p>One outstanding question is whether Shell was a one-off case or the start of a trend. Obama officials <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/13/us/politics/alaskas-tricky-intersection-of-obamas-energy-and-climate-legacies.html?smid=tw-share"">have sometimes suggested</a> that Shell was operating under leases purchased during the Bush years, and it would have been legally dicey to cancel them outright — implying, in other words, that Shell's project is an exception.</p> \n<p>But if that's the case, what will Obama do next? <span>As Ben Geman </span><a href=""http://www.nationaljournal.com/energy/2015/08/28/why-next-arctic-drilling-fight-might-be-over-before-begins?c=&amp;e=None&amp;q=The+next+offshore+drilling+fight+over+begins&amp;t=&amp;a=&amp;s=None"">points out</a><span> in National Journal, the Department of Interior is currently scheduled to hold another round of sales for oil and gas leases in the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas in 2016 and 2017. Environmental groups have been urging the Obama administration to postpone (or cancel) those sales. This is something to watch closely.</span></p> \n<p>A lot will also depend on future presidents. Would they auction off more leases to oil companies? Will regulators approve drilling plans? A Republican president (Donald Trump, say) would probably be inclined to green-light these projects. By contrast, Hillary Clinton has said she wouldn't have let Shell go forward with drilling:</p> \n<p> \n<script src=""//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"" charset=""utf-8""></script> \n</p> \n<blockquote class=""twitter-tweet"" lang=""en""> \n<p lang=""en"" dir=""ltr"">The Arctic is a unique treasure. Given what we know, it's not worth the risk of drilling. -H</p> \n— Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) <a href=""https://twitter.com/HillaryClinton/status/633629814713397249"">August 18, 2015</a>\n</blockquote> \n<p><span>That implies she'd be considerably more skeptical than Obama about future drilling.</span></p> \n<h3>7) The broader future of Arctic drilling is highly uncertain — and a lot depends on Shell</h3> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4025434/GettyImages-144124987.0.jpg"" alt=""GettyImages-144124987.0.jpg"" data-chorus-asset-id=""4025434""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">A Greenpeace activist covers the logo of the Shell oil company to protest on May 10, 2012. (Michael Cizek/AFP/Getty Images)</p> \n<p>It's also unclear whether other oil and gas companies would even <i>want </i>to move forward on drilling in the Arctic. Right now, they're watching what Shell does closely. If Shell has another misadventure — or, worse, a spill — that could be a major deterrent.</p> \n<p>But even if Shell succeeds in the Chukchi, that doesn't mean we'd see an Arctic free-for-all. Oil prices are currently quite low, hovering around $40 per barrel, which is deterring many companies from contemplating the costly Arctic. In her Bloomberg Business interview, Shell's Pickard <a href=""http://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2015-08-05/inside-shell-s-extreme-plan-to-drill-for-oil-in-the-arctic"">said</a> that oil prices would need to rise to around $70 per barrel or more by 2030 for the company's Arctic project to have been worthwhile. If not, then not.</p> \n<p><span>Then there are other countries. Russian officials have indicated a strong interest in oil and gas drilling in their slice of the Arctic. But those efforts, too, have bogged down. US and EU sanctions </span><a href=""http://www.brookings.edu/blogs/order-from-chaos/posts/2015/08/27-russia-arctic-geopolitics-baev#.VeXTRUWR0_Q.twitter"">have prevented</a><span> Rosneft, the state-owned firm that would do the drilling, from further exploration — since the company can't import Western technology or work with its erstwhile partner ExxonMobil. Low oil prices haven't helped, either.</span></p> \n<p>Ultimately, it all comes back to demand. If worldwide demand for oil keeps surging in the coming years and props up prices, then there will likely be a renewed push to drill in the Arctic. After all, as a National Petroleum Council <a href=""http://www.eenews.net/assets/2015/03/30/document_cw_01.pdf"">report</a> pointed out earlier this year, the US shale boom won't last forever, and the Arctic is the next logical place to look for further oil supplies. Conversely, if the world starts shifting to alternatives (electric cars, say) and reducing its fuel use, Arctic drilling will look less and less tempting over time.</p> \n<h3>Further reading</h3> \n<p>-- This Bloomberg Business <a href=""http://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2015-08-05/inside-shell-s-extreme-plan-to-drill-for-oil-in-the-arctic"" target=""_blank"">piece</a> by Paul Barrett and Benjamin Elgin is an in-depth look at Shell's plans to drill in the Arctic.

This Ohio utility has an innovative plan to save coal power: force customers to buy it,http://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2015/9/3/9254213/ohio-utility-coal-rates,You can't say it lacks chutzpah.,"<p>A power utility in Ohio is attempting to shaft its own customers in a manner so shameless as to defy description. Yet describe it we must, for it represents everything backward and perverse in the electricity sector and reveals that the interests of the institutions that provide electricity have come fundamentally out of sync with the interests of the citizens who depend on it.</p> \n<p>Plus it's pretty funny, in a morbid sort of way. You almost have to admire the chutzpah. But to understand it takes a little explaining. Here's the TL;DR version:</p> \n<ul> \n<li>FirstEnergy, a power company that serves 6 million customers in Ohio, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Virginia, Maryland, New Jersey, and New York, owns a handful of big nuclear and coal power plants that are no longer competitive in power markets. Rather than shut down the plants, the company is asking Ohio regulators to force customers to buy the plants' power for the next 15 years, an enormous subsidy that would ensure FirstEnergy shareholders a steady, predictable profit even as its ratepayers get hosed.</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>FirstEnergy supported markets until markets got competitive</h3> \n<p>A quick bit of background.</p> \n<p>Let's recall that US power utilities come in two basic flavors. Most Americans are still served by <em>vertically integrated</em> utilities, meaning utilities that own the entire electricity supply chain, from power plants to transmission lines to transformers to local distribution lines. They generate the power, transport it, and deliver it to customers. This is the traditional regulated-monopoly utility model, which has been around for more than a century.</p> \n<p>In the 1990s and early 2000s, there was a wave of ""deregulation,"" whereby power <em>distribution</em> utilities — the ones that send you your bill and repair your power lines — were split off from power <em>generation</em> utilities. The idea was that the latter would compete in open wholesale power markets, while the former would buy the cheapest power available on those markets.</p> \n<p>Deregulation stampeded through about 15 states (Ohio among them) and then, after the <a href=""http://www.wikiwand.com/en/California_electricity_crisis"">California Enronpocalypse of 2000</a>, froze, where it remains more or less the same to this day. Here's the state of play as of 2012:</p> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""4021742""><img src=""https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4021742/consumers-digest-utilities.jpg""></div> \n<p>Until quite recently, FirstEnergy was a big fan of deregulation. It is a ""utility holding company,"" which means it owns lots of utilities on both the distribution and generation sides. With deregulation it spun off its best generation assets — mostly big coal plants — into independent companies that made big money on wholesale power markets. As a bonus, in the process of deregulation it secured a <a href=""http://www.rtoinsider.com/firstenergy-subsidize-gen/"">$6.9 billion subsidy</a> from customers to cover assets it risked having ""stranded"" in competitive markets. (Customers protecting FirstEnergy shareholders from the risks of competition turns out to be a running theme here.)</p> \n<p>For years, those big power plants made money as expected, and shareholders were happy, though rates in Ohio <a href=""http://ycharts.com/indicators/ohio_electric_utility_retail_price_yearly"">continued to climb</a>.</p> \n<p>Lately, however, something has happened in power markets that FirstEnergy finds most disturbing: competition. Natural gas has gotten very cheap even as electricity demand has stagnated. It's undercutting both nuclear and coal, even as coal plants undergo expensive retrofits to comply with new public health regulations.</p> \n<p>So FirstEnergy has seen its generation companies take a beating.</p> \n<p>It isn't the only utility holding company in the same predicament. As I <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/8/26/9209227/exelon-pepco-merger-opposition"">wrote last week</a>, trouble on the generation side is what has energy giant Exelon wanting to eat up distribution utilities like Pepco, where it can find safer, less volatile revenue streams.</p> \n<p>What FirstEnergy really wants is to <a href=""http://www.ohio.com/news/local/firstenergy-ceo-says-it-s-time-to-get-conversation-rolling-about-ending-deregulation-1.611947"">return to regulated markets</a> and end this competition nonsense once and for all. But that's a big lift. In the meantime, it has struck on a novel strategy that, whatever else you might say about it, requires some serious brass ovaries.</p> \n<h3>FirstEnergy would like to go back to the no-competition please</h3> \n<p>FirstEnergy is concerned with the fate of two big power plants. The first is the <a href=""http://www.wikiwand.com/en/W._H._Sammis_Power_Plant"">W.H. Sammis Power Plant</a> in Stratton, Ohio, a very large, very old coal-fired plant that has recently undergone expensive renovations to bring it in line with environmental standards. The second is the <a href=""http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Davis%E2%80%93Besse_Nuclear_Power_Station"">Davis-Besse power plant</a> on Lake Erie, a very large, very old nuclear plant with a <a href=""http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Davis%E2%80%93Besse_Nuclear_Power_Station#/Incident_history"">history of safety incidents</a>.</p> \n<p>Under the terms of the rate plan FirstEnergy recently submitted to the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (PUCO), the ratepayers of three of its distribution utilities — Illuminating Co., Ohio Edison, and Toledo Edison — would be forced to buy, through a ""power purchase agreement"" (PPA), all the power that those two plants produce over the next 15 years, along with the output of two other very old coal plants in which FirstEnergy has a partial stake. Among the costs consumers would cover are a $600 million upgrade to the nuclear plant and an 11 percent return on investment to FirstEnergy shareholders.</p> \n<p>It's worth pausing a moment let that sink in. The company can't sell its product on a competitive market, so it's asking the state to force customers to buy it. For <em>15 years</em>. A Russian oligarch would blush.</p> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4026498/first-energy-sammis-plant.0.jpg"" alt=""W. H. Sammis Plant"" data-chorus-asset-id=""4026498""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">The W.H. Sammis Plant. (<a href=""https://www.firstenergycorp.com/content/fecorp/environmental/environmental_stewardship/generation/sammis_plant.html"">FirstEnergy</a>)</p> \n<p>The company claims the agreement would mean a modest increase in customer bills in the early years, followed by rebates in the later years, for a total savings over 15 years of $2 billion. This is based on the assumption that natural gas prices will eventually shoot back up (and that renewables will not continue their downward march). The exact details are unclear, since FirstEnergy hasn't shared its modeling, but in effect it is assuming that the current financial difficulties facing large coal and nuclear power plants are a temporary problem. That is ... optimistic.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, the Ohio Consumers Counsel, a state agency assigned to protect the interests of utility ratepayers, <a href=""http://www.occ.ohio.gov/electric/fe/Factsheet_FirstEnergy_ESP_2016-2019.pdf"">contends</a> that the deal will cost ratepayers $3 billion over 15 years. According to <a href=""http://www.rtoinsider.com/firstenergy-subsidize-gen/"">RTO Insider</a>, ""UBS Securities said the PPA was priced to begin at about $65/MWh — <em>$26  above current market prices</em> — and increase by $2/MWh annually"" [my emphasis]. This is what FirstEnergy refers to as ""price stability.""</p> \n<p>Beyond the costs to consumers, large, subsidized baseload plants would suppress the market for new renewable energy and make it difficult for the state to comply with the Clean Power Plan.</p> \n<p>FirstEnergy has said that it will be forced to close the plants without this subsidy, but under grilling at the <a href=""http://www.cleveland.com/business/index.ssf/2015/08/firstenrgy_could_improve_power.html"">first hearing on the rate case</a> — held Monday and, delightfully, filmed for the second season of Showtime's <i>Years of Living Dangerously</i> — the company's director of rates and regulatory affairs, Eileen M. Mikkelsen, admitted that she couldn't say that for sure.</p> \n<h3>FirstEnergy's business plan is to keep its baseload plants running</h3> \n<p>Utilities have known for years that change is coming to the electricity industry, as power plants gets smaller and more nimble and customers, through distributed energy, become producers and demand a more sophisticated grid. Some utilities are working to create new business plans that accommodate these realities.</p> \n<p>FirstEnergy has opted instead to double down on its baseload plants, doing everything it can to keep demand high and competitors out.</p> \n<p>That's why it joined a coalition that <a href=""http://powersource.post-gazette.com/powersource/policy-powersource/2014/11/25/FirstEnergy-says-demand-response-putting-powerplants-out-of-business/stories/201411250013"">sued FERC</a> to keep ""demand response"" — programs that would shift or reduce electricity demand at times of congestion — out of PJM wholesale energy markets. Said a spokesman, ""We feel that it’s going to lead to even more premature closures of power plants."" (Here's a question: if shifts in demand render a power plant unnecessary, in what way is that plant's closure ""premature""?)</p> \n<p>FirstEnergy's devotion to its baseload plants is also why it <a href=""http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2014/05/28/3442396/ohio-renewable-energy-vote/"">led the fight</a> to roll back Ohio's clean energy standard, which forces it to invest in competition to those plants. (It only succeeded in <a href=""http://www.cleveland.com/business/index.ssf/2014/06/ohio_renewable_energy_and_effi.html"">freezing the standard in place</a>, not scrapping it.)</p> \n<p>It's also why FirstEnergy is hostile to energy efficiency. Last year, the company <a href=""http://www.cleveland.com/business/index.ssf/2014/09/energy_efficiency_programs_wil.html"">cancelled</a> all its residential and industrial efficiency programs. In a 2013 report to PUCO, it calculated that ""for every $1 spent on energy efficiency, customers had saved more than $2 in power costs."" Nonetheless, the following year, it claimed that canceling efficiency programs would <em>save</em> consumers money. Why? Because consumers would no longer have to pay the extra fees that FirstEnergy charged to make up for the revenue it was losing through efficiency. Orwell would blush.</p> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4026540/first-energy-davis-besse-nuclear.0.jpg"" alt=""Davis–Besse Nuclear Power Station"" data-chorus-asset-id=""4026540""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">The Davis–Besse Nuclear Power Station (Nuclear Regulatory Commission, via <a href=""https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:David_Besse_NPP.jpg"">Wikipedia</a>)</p> \n<p>And finally, devotion to these baseload plants has led CEO Chuck Jones to make the <a href=""http://www.cleveland.com/opinion/index.ssf/2015/08/firstenergys_powering_our_prog.html"">truly bizarre argument</a> that ""Ohio is losing its energy independence"" because instead of importing coal from outside the state on trains, it is importing electricity from outside the state on power lines. Says Jones, in horror, ""these billion-dollar transmission projects are paid for solely by customers."" This is the guy, you will recall, trying to stick customers with a 15 year bill for outdated power plants.</p> \n<p>Regardless, importing electricity is cheaper than importing coal. And it's not entirely clear what value Ohio would derive from being energy independent of, say, Indiana anyway.</p> \n<p>Why all this agita on behalf of a few power plants? ""Ohio’s economic security and quality of life is highly dependent on maintaining a diverse mix of baseload coal and nuclear power plants,"" then-CEO Anthony Alexander said in a 2014 <a href=""https://www.firstenergycorp.com/content/fecorp/newsroom/news_releases/firstenergy-ohio-utilities-announce-powering-ohio-s-progress--a-.html"">statement</a>. (Savor, for a moment, the phrase ""diverse mix of baseload coal and nuclear power plants."" Diverse indeed.)</p> \n<p>So in FirstEnergy's view, Ohio's economic security and quality of life are not served by renewable energy. They're not served by demand response, or energy efficiency. And apparently they are not served by competitive power markets. No, they can only be vouchsafed through the continued, state-mandated operation of a particular set of extremely old, economically uncompetitive power plants.</p> \n<p>That is crazy.</p> \n<p>A large majority of the American public, along with virtually every serious climate-change analyst, agrees that America needs to use more renewable electricity and to use electricity as efficiently as possible. Those two goals are essential (if not sufficient) to addressing climate change. As a bonus, they <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/7/28/9053283/clean-energy-efficiency-money"">save consumers money</a>.</p> \n<p>But both those goals are directly contrary to the financial interests of the company that has been granted a state-sponsored monopoly over electricity provision for 6 million people in Ohio and surrounding states.</p> \n<p>It's not a healthy situation. Nor is it coherent public policy.</p> \n<h3>FirstEnergy's attempt at Soviet-style market planning is likely to fail</h3> \n<p>PUCO is likely to reject FirstEnergy's rate case. It's not that the company has no pull. Legislators are acutely aware of the jobs and tax contributions provided by large power plants, whereas the benefits of cheaper, cleaner electricity are more diffuse. Utilities and their regulators have a long, cozy relationship that has mostly taken place outside the public gaze, protected by a <a href=""http://grist.org/climate-energy/utilities-for-dummies-how-they-work-and-why-that-needs-to-change/"">forcefield of tedium</a>.</p> \n<p>But these days, <a href=""http://www.politico.com/agenda/story/2015/05/inside-war-on-coal-000002"">people are watching</a>. Activist groups can't match the money and legal manpower of the big utility holding companies, but they can draw attention to the proceedings, and sometimes that's enough. PUCO <a href=""http://www.cleveland.com/business/index.ssf/2015/02/puco_rejects_deal_to_have_rate.html"">rejected a very similar request</a> from utility giant AEP earlier this year after activists mobilized around it. It would be difficult to justify a different decision in this case.</p> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4026544/wksu-puco-protest.0.jpg"" alt=""PUCO protest"" data-chorus-asset-id=""4026544""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Protestors in Cleveland drawing attention to a PUCO meeting on FirstEnergy. (<a href=""http://www.wksu.org/news/story/41689"">WKSU</a>)</p> \n<p>The fact is, if FirstEnergy can exploit its distribution customers to pay off the lemons owned by its generation companies, then it might as well be a vertically integrated utility. It's difficult to imagine anything more contrary to the spirit of deregulation.</p> \n<p>The company has been trying to convince Ohioans that competitive markets will bankrupt it and destroy the reliability of the grid. It finally got under the skin of PUCO chair Andre Porter, who <a href=""http://www.bizjournals.com/columbus/blog/ohio-energy-inc/2015/08/stop-trying-to-scare-ohioans-puco-chief-tells.html"">said last week</a>:</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>Stop trying to scare Ohioans.

Climate economists are coming around to the idea that a carbon tax isn't enough,http://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2015/9/4/9261801/carbon-tax,Baby steps.,"<p>The journal <i>Nature</i> has published a new commentary from a set of six (mostly) economists, called <a href=""http://www.nature.com/news/energy-policy-push-renewables-to-spur-carbon-pricing-1.18260"">""Push renewables to spur carbon pricing.""</a> It is notable not so much for the argument it makes as for the wider changes it augurs.</p> \n<p>The argument goes something like this:</p> \n<ol> \n<li>Carbon pricing is key to any serious, comprehensive effort to address climate change.</li> \n<li>It is politically difficult to implement carbon pricing — especially to implement a price as high as what's needed. (No extant carbon pricing system has a high enough price.)</li> \n<li>The declining cost of renewable energy, which has been accelerated by policy, lowers political barriers and makes carbon pricing an easier political lift.</li> \n<li>Therefore, economists and other fans of carbon pricing ought to support policies that further accelerate the deployment of renewable energy. (The piece mentions time-of-use pricing for utilities, modernizing grids, the Clean Power Plan, various renewable energy subsidies, and more.)</li> \n</ol> \n<p>When I first read this, my reaction was, ""Yeah, no shit."" This is something clean energy activists and (<a href=""http://econpapers.repec.org/article/eeeenepol/v_3a69_3ay_3a2014_3ai_3ac_3ap_3a467-477.htm"">some</a>) analysts have been banging on about for a long time.</p> \n<p>But I think it is significant. Lead author Gernot Wagner is a senior economist at the Environmental Defense Fund, which has championed carbon pricing since the 1990s. A few years ago, I would have pegged him as a pretty standard-issue climate economist (albeit a nice and very smart one), whose attitude toward climate policies that aren't carbon pricing hovered between disdain and hold-your-nose tolerance.</p> \n<p>In his <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/But-Will-Planet-Notice-Economics/dp/B0085SF9KU"">first book</a> he argued, as many newly minted climate economists are wont to do, that economics can save the world, if only non-economists would shut up and listen. (Okay, that latter part is implicit.) However, his <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Climate-Shock-Economic-Consequences-Hotter/dp/0691159475/ref=asap_bc?ie=UTF8"">latest book</a> (co-authored with climate economist Martin Weitzman) and the <i>Nature</i> commentary evidence a shift toward a more gimlet-eyed pragmatism.</p> \n<p>The book focuses less on the kinds of damages that can be quantified and plugged into economic models than on <i>degrees of risk</i>, just as the commentary focuses less on blue-sky policy than on <i>good-enough policy</i>, measures that can get cultural and political momentum going, judged not against a theoretical alternative but against the real-world baseline of no policy.</p> \n<p>In both cases, what we see is an economist grappling seriously with <i>political economy</i>, the trade-offs inevitably faced in a world where dangers are uncertain, time is short, and political change faces severe headwinds.</p> \n<p>It seems to me — though I may be projecting, since this is also my fond hope — that Wagner's evolution is indicative of a broader shift in the community of climate economists and wonks, away from arms-length purity (""we're not like those <i>activists</i>, we have <i>models</i>"") to a more jaundiced but realistic engagement with the social and political forces that shape policymaking. It is a welcome sign.</p>",Politics
It's not just Ahmed Mohamed: anti-Muslim bigotry in America is out of control,http://www.vox.com/2015/9/16/9336967/ahmed-mohamed-islamophobia,The country's 2.6 million Muslim citizens increasingly live in an atmosphere of fear and hostility.,"<p>The arrest of 14-year-old Ahmed Mohamed, who was treated as a threat by his own school and police for bringing in an electronic clock he'd made as an engineering project, was not an isolated event. This was completely in line with a problem that has been growing over the past year: Islamophobia, which is the fear-based hatred of Muslims, is out of control in American society.</p> \n<p>To understand why a Texas school would arrest a 14-year-old student for bringing in a homemade clock, it helps to understand what came before: the TV news hosts who declare Muslims ""unusually barbaric,"" the politicians who gin up fear of Islam, the blockbuster film that depicts even Muslim children as dangerous threats, and the wave of hatred against Muslims that has culminated several times in violence so severe that what happened to Mohamed, while terrible, appears unsurprising and almost normal within the context of ever-worsening American Islamophobia.</p> \n<p>Many Americans might be totally unaware this is happening, even though they are surrounded by Islamophobia: on TV, at airport security, in our pop culture and our politics, and inevitably in our schools. Perhaps, then, Mohamed's arrest will be a wake-up call.</p> \n<h3>Even just in greater Dallas, 2015 has been a year of Islamophobia</h3> \n<p> \n<script src=""http://www.nbcdfw.com/portableplayer/?cmsID=288937041&amp;videoID=NluS4OdTLqRE&amp;origin=nbcdfw.com&amp;sec=news&amp;subsec=local&amp;width=600&amp;height=360"" charset=""UTF-8"" type=""text/javascript""></script> \n</p> \n<p>American Islamophobia has grown so severe that, even looking just at the neighborhoods immediately surrounding Mohamed's Dallas suburb, one can see, in broad daylight, the climate of hostility and fear America's 2.6 million Muslims have been made to live in.</p> \n<p>The trouble began in January, when American Muslim families did what is increasingly expected of them, what American media and politicians demand of Muslims every time there is a terrorist attack: They gathered to formally condemn violent extremism and to cultivate positive ties with their local communities. They did this by organizing an event in the suburb of Garland called ""Stand With the Prophet Against Terror and Hate,"" to raise money for a center dedicated to promoting tolerance.</p> \n<p>In response, <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.nbcdfw.com/news/local/Thousands-Protest-Muslim-Conference-in-Garland-288936351.html"">thousands of protesters</a> mobbed the event, <span>waving anti-Muslim signs and American flags for hours, forcing local Muslim families who attended to endure a gauntlet of hate. </span><span>""We don't want them here,"" a woman at the protests </span><a href=""http://www.nbcdfw.com/news/local/Thousands-Protest-Muslim-Conference-in-Garland-288936351.html"" target=""_blank"" style=""font-size: 1.3em; line-height: 1.65; background-color: #ffffff;"">told a local TV reporter</a><span>.

Mohamed, a student with a love of science, had assembled a simple electronic clock as a sort of engineering project. He brought it into school to show it off to his engineering teacher, who was impressed.</p> \n<p>But when another teacher discovered the clock, school officials asked police to arrest Mohamed, handcuffing and humiliating him in front of his fellow students.

Rather, it is a story about widespread American problems that are playing out across the country, that occur regularly and repeatedly, and that have created the climate that made this incident and many others possible.</p> \n<h3>How American media creates a climate of anti-Muslim hate and fear</h3> \n<p><!-- CHORUS_VIDEO_EMBED ChorusVideo:57002 --></p> \n<p>This Islamophobia did not come from nowhere; the story of America's resurgent Islamophobia is in many ways a media story. Over the past year, much of the media has treated the rise of ISIS in the Middle East as an indictment of Islam itself, a sign that Muslims are somehow less human and more violent.</p> \n<p>This media coverage plays into precisely the narrative that groups such as ISIS wish to set, in which Islam and its 1.6 billion worldwide adherents are conflated with a tiny minority of extremists — even though it is Muslims who are by far the most likely to be killed by extremist groups, and who are the most likely to take up arms against them.

(TIMOTHY CLARY/AFP/Getty)</p> \n<p>The school and police officials in Irving, Texas, as appalling as their actions may have been, were only doing what the American TV media has been telling them to do all year: to view Muslims with fear and suspicion, and to do whatever is necessary to neutralize the threat they pose.</p> \n<p>It is no coincidence that popular attitudes toward Muslims are becoming more hostile in the US: Americans are <a href=""http://www.pewforum.org/2014/07/16/how-americans-feel-about-religious-groups/"">more skeptical</a> about Muslims and Islam, express <a href=""http://www.aaiusa.org/reports/american-attitudes-toward-arabs-and-muslims-2014"">lower favorability</a> toward Muslims, are more likely to support racial profiling of Muslims, and increasingly say that Muslim Americans cannot be trusted in positions of government authority.</p> \n<p>Sometimes the media is so effective at engendering Islamophobia that you can see attitudes hardening right before your eyes. Maher, in defending his comments about Muslims in an <a href=""http://www.salon.com/2014/10/06/exclusive_bill_maher_on_islam_spat_with_ben_affleck_were_not_crazy_tea_baggers/"">interview with Salon</a>, bragged about as much. Here is he describing how, over time, as he has pounded away at Muslims, his once skeptical audiences have grown to accept and even embrace his ideas:</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>What I think is interesting is that the audience, my studio audience, has really come around on this issue. When I used to talk about it, it was just either stony silence or outright booing and now I notice quite a shift. ...</p> \n<p>When I talked about it at the end of last week's show, they stood up at the end — they cheered during it and they stood up at the end. And when I introduced the topic last night, I'd say about half the audience gave a cheer when I said we need to stand up for liberal principles.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>That bears repeating: The audiences used to sit quietly or boo when Maher espoused his hateful and factually incorrect views on Islam. Now they stand up and cheer.

""We will see how long they stay in my office,"" she said.</p> \n<p>Her stunt likely seemed silly to many Americans — another far-flung legislator saying something outlandish — but it was neither isolated nor fringe, but rather part of a concerted and deliberate campaign to promote anti-Muslim fear and hatred that has coincided with anti-Muslim violence.</p> \n<p>Elements of the Republican Party <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/1/30/7931905/jindal-islam-2016"" target=""_blank"">have been hijacked</a>, at state and national levels, by a fringe group of anti-Muslim activists who see Islam itself as a threat.

It is the same climate that led school officials, even a full day later, to see Mohamed's arrest not as a terrible mistake but as an opportunity to send a <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/9/16/9336557/ahmed-mohamed-clock-school"">letter</a> to parents asking them to be on guard against ""suspicious activities.""</p> \n<p>This climate did not come from nowhere, and it is not isolated to Irving or to Texas or to the South. It came from CNN and Fox News, from Bobby Jindal and Bill Maher and Pamela Geller, from <i>American Sniper</i> and the film industry that decided to greenlight a mega-blockbuster that is laced with bigotry.</p> \n<p>It comes from fear and prejudice, it affects 2.6 million Americans, and, make no mistake, it is getting worse. It will continue to get worse until American society can recognize this problem in itself and begin to honestly address it, even if it is uncomfortable, even if many of us struggle to look past headscarves and prayer rugs to see human beings.</p> \n<p>The murders of the three students in Chapel Hill took us a step closer to seeing the problem of American Islamophobia and dealing with it, but it did not get us there. Perhaps the images of Ahmed Mohamed's arrest, the news that this child now says he no longer wants to share the things he builds, will finally help us see that Ahmed's arrest is an American problem, it is systemic, and, if we are to live up to our national ideals, we have to address it.</p>",Politics
Ahmed Mohamed came up in the JV Republican debate. It didn't go well.,http://www.vox.com/2015/9/16/9341651/ahmed-mohamed-gop-debate,Candidates refused even to say his name.,"<p>On Wednesday, at the first round of the Republican presidential debate, the candidates were asked about <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/9/16/9338099/ahmed-mohamed-irving-texas-clock"">Ahmed Mohamed</a>, whose arrest had provoked a national backlash, both against the school that arrested him and against the broader trend of Islamophobia run amok.</p> \n<!--  ########  BEGIN VOLUME VIDEO  ########  --> \n<div data-volume-id=""4303"" data-analytics-placement=""article:lede"" data-volume-placement=""lede"" id=""volume-placement-8082"" class=""volume-video"" data-volume-uuid=""c4681deaa"" data-analytics-label=""Jindal, Graham, Pataki respond to Ahmed arrest | 4303"" data-analytics-action=""volume:view:article:lede"" data-analytics-viewport=""video""></div> \n<!--  ########  END VOLUME VIDEO  ########  --> \n<p>It did not go well. The candidates were clearly uncomfortable with the subject of Islamophobia and anti-Muslim bigotry and worked very hard to avoid it. Of the three candidates who answered, none could bring themselves even to say the boy's name, Ahmed Mohamed. All three attempted to shift the conversation to Kim Davis, the Kentucky clerk who refused to issue <a href=""http://www.vox.com/marriage-equality"">same-sex marriage</a> licenses.</p> \n<p>Unsurprisingly, but depressingly, none came anywhere near acknowledging, much less condemning, the rise tide of intolerance against Muslims in America, and in some cases they fed into it.</p> \n<p>Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal was asked first whether the incident showed that ""anti-Muslim discrimination"" could go too far. Jindal, who has previously (and falsely) claimed that Muslims in the UK had converted vast areas into ""no-go zones"" for non-Muslims, seemed immensely uncomfortable with the question.</p> \n<p>Jindal said he was glad the student had been released but avoided saying whether he should've been arrested, then pivoted immediately to Kim Davis, whom he called proof that ""the biggest discrimination going on is against Christian business owners and individuals who believe in traditional forms of marriage.""</p> \n<p>When it was Sen. Lindsey Graham's turn to answer, he drew a bizarre contrast between Kim Davis and ""young men from the Mideast,"" whom he said he feared. It is honestly not clear to me, reading and re-reading his answer, whether he was suggesting this fear of ""young men from the Mideast"" includes 14-year-old Ahmed Mohamed, or if he had just completely forgotten about the arrest of a child that had hours earlier become a national controversy:</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>Kim Davis, I'm not worried about her attacking me. I am worried about radical Islamic terrorists who are already here planning another 9/11. We're at war, folks, I'm not fighting a crime. I want to have a legal system that understands the difference between fighting a war and fighting a crime. And here's the reality: young men from the Mideast are different than Kim Davis and we've got to understand that. Islamic web sites need to be monitored. And if you're on one I want to know what you're doing.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Former New York Gov. George Pataki answered as well, but mostly discussed Kim Davis. He did say that if Davis had been Muslim, then there would not have been ""that same outrage"" on her behalf.</p> \n<p>In all, if you care about what happened to Ahmed Mohamed, and especially if you care about the larger trend of anti-Muslim bigotry that his story represents, then this segment of the Republican presidential debate would leave you with the impression that these candidates do not particularly care about these issues and would really rather avoid them.</p>",Politics
How inefficient climate policies can build support for efficient ones,http://www.vox.com/2015/9/17/9343125/climate-policy-sequencing,Using policies to build constituencies.,"<p>Debates over policy often proceed in a kind of vacuum, ignoring the political forces that shape the trajectory and character of policymaking. A <a href=""http://www.sciencemag.org/content/349/6253/1170.summary"">new analysis in </a><i><a href=""http://www.sciencemag.org/content/349/6253/1170.summary"">Science</a></i> tries to counter this tendency in the area of climate policy, urging analysts to strategically consider the political effects of various policy alternatives.</p> \n<p>More to the point: it asks them to get over their obsession with carbon pricing.</p> \n<h3>The economic argument for carbon pricing</h3> \n<p>There's a long-running dispute in climate circles between those who support economy-wide carbon pricing as the best and perhaps only legitimate climate policy and those who (also) support targeted ""green industrial policy"" that boosts specific industries or technologies (think renewable energy standards, feed-in tariffs, or technology subsidies).</p> \n<p>The argument for economy-wide climate pricing — articulated frequently by economists, economist wannabes, and the <i><a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-carbon-tax/2012/11/10/6c576bfa-29f5-11e2-b4e0-346287b7e56c_story.html"">Washington Post</a></i><a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-carbon-tax/2012/11/10/6c576bfa-29f5-11e2-b4e0-346287b7e56c_story.html""> editorial page</a> — is simple: Rather than ""choosing winners and losers"" by favoring this or that technology, putting an equal price on every ton of carbon emissions allows the invisible hand of the market to work its magic, making the cheapest emission reductions first and working up from there. It is perfectly economically efficient. In theory.</p> \n<p>Green industrial policy, by focusing on particular sectors or technology, inevitably excludes some methods of reducing carbon and favors others. Consequently, it is less economically efficient — it costs more per ton of carbon reduced. And it raises the danger of ""regulatory capture,"" by which beneficiaries of a targeted policy influence regulators to continue the policy.</p> \n<p>That's the argument for <i>carbon pricing uber alles</i>, which is the default position of Very Serious People these days (when they think about climate change at all). And as long as the argument takes place on the plane of economic abstraction, it's difficult to counter.</p> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""4070212"">\n<img src=""https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4070212/winners-losers.jpg""> \n<div class=""caption""> \n<p>Green industrial policy, basically.</p> \n</div> \n</div> \n<h3>The argument for green industrial policy</h3> \n<p>But when the argument leaves the realm of economic abstraction and moves into the world of political economy, it's a different story. The two types of policy have very different political profiles and different political effects.</p> \n<p>A carbon tax is a paradigmatic <i>wide</i> policy — it sends a weak signal to the entire economy. The damages are concentrated in carbon-heavy sectors (which also concentrates political opposition) while the benefits are spread broadly over the populace (which diffuses political support). Green industrial policies are <i>narrow</i> — they send a strong signal to a particular economic sector. Their benefits are concentrated, while their costs are diffuse or hidden. This lends them roughly the inverse political valence and makes them difficult to uproot once they are passed, as the resilience of state renewable energy standards shows.</p> \n<p>I <a href=""http://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2015/9/4/9261801/carbon-tax"">wrote the other day</a> about the dawning realization among (some) economists that green industrial policy might be necessary as a way of building political support for carbon pricing. Now a <a href=""http://www.sciencemag.org/content/349/6253/1170.summary"">new analysis in the journal </a><i><a href=""http://www.sciencemag.org/content/349/6253/1170.summary"">Science</a></i> helps put a little flesh on the bones of that idea.</p> \n<p>Jonas Meckling and a group of fellow political scientists at UC Berkeley note that green industrial policy, by targeting its benefits, helps create industries and coalitions that support future policy. The classic historical example here is Germany:</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>German policies began with funding for research and development, then subsidies for demonstration projects during the 1970s and 1980s, and continued to larger-scale market formation programs, including a feed-in law after the 1986 Chernobyl disaster. These policies led to industrial expansion in wind and, later, solar energy production; these developments helped create and expand a coalition of interests that fought to defend existing measures and supported further measures.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>For all the hassle Germany sometimes gets from wonks, it has sequenced its climate policies brilliantly. Each one creates more industries and constituencies that support further policy expansion.</p> \n<p>This slow ramping up of policy holds in most places that have achieved carbon pricing, as this graphic shows:</p> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""4066608""><img src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4066608/science-meckling-sequencing-climate-policy.png""></div> \n<p>Here's the key takeaway:</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>Economists view [green industrial policies] as third- or fourth-best options for efficiency. But research in political science and law suggests that green industrial policy nurtures a political landscape of interests and coalitions that benefit from a transformation to low-carbon energy use—even when polluting industries might oppose it.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Targeted policies create the ""political landscape of interests and coalitions"" necessary to pass more ambitious policies like carbon pricing. With that in mind, the authors recommend a three-pronged strategy to policymakers.</p> \n<h3>The argument for strategic sequencing of climate policies</h3> \n<p>First, start with ""targeted sector-specific policies,"" which concentrate benefits in a visible way. The very specificity that wonks hate is what gives green industrial policies their power. The benefits are easy to see and understand, unlike broader policies like carbon pricing, which are more abstract and less salient to normal voters.</p> \n<p>Also, targeted policies can be linked with co-benefits that answer other policy concerns, thus opening up the space for coalition-building. (One example: reducing carbon pollution also tends to lower local pollutants like smog, which creates space for climate hawks to ally with health and social justice groups.) As long as political will for climate policy per se is limited, which it is likely to be for the foreseeable future, these coalitions will be important.</p> \n<p>Second, ""send direct, high-leverage policy signals rather than broad, shallow ones."" Again, this is roughly the opposite of the economist's advice. But the weak, economy-wide signals economists support will tend to produce changes at the margin, within the paradigm established by status quo industries.</p> \n<p>Serious political change requires more than that; it requires that the status quo be substantially disrupted. That in turn requires ""concrete, meaningful changes in industry investment or structure"" that can only be achieved with the strong, direct incentives created by green industrial policy.</p> \n<p>Third, ""sequence policies strategically."" Done right, targeted policies can plant seeds that grow into political coalitions. Policymakers should be conscious about implementing laws and programs that grow those coalitions, with an eye toward eventually moving from targeted, specific policies to more general policies like carbon pricing.</p> \n<p>Unfortunately, the authors don't say much about this strategic sequencing, other than to urge further research, to answer questions like these:</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>[W]hat type of policy sequences work in different types of political or energy systems? How can policy-makers avoid dead ends and maintain flexibility for adjusting policy measures? How can policy-makers best balance needs for politically salient and economically efficient policy interventions? When are policy-makers likely to retrench from decarbonization trajectories? How will opposing ""brown"" coalitions adapt over time to strategies based on these concepts?</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Good questions! These are exactly the sort of inquiries I had in mind when I <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/8/20/9179001/clean-energy-political-economy"">called for more attention to political economy</a> among climate researchers.</p> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""4070220"">\n<img src=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4070220/germany-solar.jpg""> \n<div class=""caption""> \n<p>German political constituents.</p> \n</div> \n</div> \n<h3>Real policy is still better than imaginary policy</h3> \n<p>On an economist's blackboard, carbon pricing is the most efficient policy, assuming it can be a) passed and b) raised to the right level.</p> \n<p>It turns out, however, that those are heroic assumptions. Because its costs are concentrated and its benefits diffuse, carbon pricing is politically difficult. And it is <i>not</i> economically efficient if it takes 50 years to implement it and raise it high enough to work.</p> \n<p>If targeted green industrial policy can help create political coalitions that support carbon pricing and get pricing implemented in, say, 10 years, then a portfolio of policies that begins with green industrial policy is more efficient. Real policy is better at reducing emissions than imaginary policy.</p> \n<p>Thinking through policy this way — not just how many tons of carbon it reduces, but how much it helps build or grow political coalitions — is a much-needed shift in the climate community. Policy ideas are inert in the absence of political strategy.</p>",Politics
What was really going on in that awkward debate moment about putting a woman on the $10,http://www.vox.com/2015/9/17/9347307/gop-debate-woman-ten-dollar,The candidates' answers were very revealing.,"<p>During last night’s GOP presidential debate, CNN moderator Jake Tapper lobbed what should have been a softball question at the candidates:  ""Earlier this year the Treasury Department announced that a woman will appear on the $10 bill. What woman would you like to see on the $10 bill?""</p> \n<p>This should have been an easy one. All the candidates had to do was choose a prominent American woman. How hard could that be?</p> \n<p>Apparently very, very, very hard. Three candidates named members of their own families, one refused to answer, and two more selected foreigners.</p> \n<p>This wasn't just an awkward moment in a long and exhausting debate, although it was certainly that. It was a pretty revealing, and appropriately painful, illustration of the GOP's serious and persistent difficulty reaching women, and why that problem goes a lot deeper than having polices unfavorable to women's rights.</p> \n<h3>The candidates praised women as caregivers or supporters</h3> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""4071702"" alt=""Jeb Bush Donald Trump debate"" src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4071702/GettyImages-488682854.0.jpg""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Justin Sullivan / Getty</p> \n<p>You can see the problem in not just who the candidates picked, but how they argued for them. Mike Huckabee chose his own wife, and Ben Carson his own mother, both arguing that the women should be honored for being such excellent caretakers. In their minds, apparently, the highest contribution an American woman can make to her country is to lovingly care for a male Republican.</p> \n<p>Chris Christie made a similar argument on behalf of his choice, Abigail Adams: ""Our country wouldn't be here without John Adams,"" he said, ""and he wouldn't have been able to do it without Abigail Adams. So I would put Abigail Adams on the $10 bill."" In other words, he was honoring her for service to her husband, not service to her country.</p> \n<p>Even the candidates who chose women known for their own accomplishments gravitated towards caregivers. Scott Walker selected Clara Barton, a pioneering nurse who founded the American Red Cross, and John Kasich chose Mother Theresa, who isn’t even American.</p> \n<p>As Megan Thielking tweeted after the debate, the candidates returned again and again to descriptions of women as beautiful, angelic caregivers:</p> \n<blockquote lang=""en"" class=""twitter-tweet""> \n<p dir=""ltr"" lang=""en"">here is a list of the words we have used for women tonight:  angel beautiful love of my life person who carries the babies</p> \n— Megan Thielking (@meggophone) <a href=""https://twitter.com/meggophone/status/644345175674888193"">September 17, 2015</a>\n</blockquote> \n<p> \n<script charset=""utf-8"" src=""//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js""></script> \n</p> \n<h3>Why it's so hard for Republicans to talk about accomplished women</h3> \n<p>It's no accident that these candidates so struggled to name prominent American women, and when they did, described them as caregivers.</p> \n<p>A big part of this is that there's disconnect between the traditional gender norms that the GOP still tries to embrace, and the reality of women's lives in America today.</p> \n<p>A lot of GOP voters are pretty big fans of traditional gender roles — recall the wild applause that Trump got in the first debate when he dismissed the criticism of his insulting comments about women as mere ""political correctness."" That means that there's risk for candidates who flout those norms, and incentive to maintain them.</p> \n<p>You could see this, for instance, when Ted Cruz mentioned his wife. He did not refer to her as ""the successful Goldman Sachs managing director"" or ""the accomplished Bush administration veteran,"" but rather as ""my angel."" Praising women for their accomplishments as wives, mothers, daughters, and caregivers is a way to embrace those traditional norms and argue that those accomplishments should be what women aspire to — which makes it difficult to talk about women who do the sorts of things that usually get you printed on the currency.</p> \n<p>And there's a related, but subtler way this problem plays out: because feminism only started to bring about real change in the late 20th century, many of America's most groundbreaking women have made their accomplishments in recent decades. But that makes it likely that those women have also embraced, say, reproductive rights or marriage equality — ideas that don't play well on a Republican primary debate stage.</p> \n<p>That makes it hard for Republicans to find an American woman who is famous for her groundbreaking accomplishments but who isn't also likely to offend conservative sensibilities, either because the woman herself was a liberal, or because she flouted tradition in ways that conservative voters would be uncomfortable with honoring.</p> \n<p>First woman in space Sally Ride, for instance, was a groundbreaking astronaut, scientist, and educator — but also gay, making her an awkward choice for a party that rejects same-sex marriage. Sandra Day O'Connor was the first woman appointed to the Supreme Court, and a Republican to boot, but her judicial opinions made her unpopular with pro-life conservatives. Even Rosa Parks, whom three candidates (Rubio, Cruz, and Trump) picked for the $10 bill, <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/rosa-parks-10-bill_55faee9ae4b08820d917b12a?r356zuxr&amp;ncid=tweetlnkushpmg00000067"">turns out</a> to have been on the board of Planned Parenthood. <span>And so on.</span></p> \n<p>That's not to say that there are no options. They could have named a conservative writer like Ayn Rand, a pioneer heroine like Laura Ingalls Wilder, or an apolitical scientist like Nobel Prize winner Barbara McClintock. But not as many political leaders: as Jeb Bush's quickly-withdrawn selection of Margaret Thatcher highlighted, the US has thus far failed to produce its own Thatcher. This country has never elected any woman, Democrat or Republican, as president or even vice-president. To find one, Bush had to look overseas.</p> \n<p>Of course, that might not last. In last night's debate, Carly Fiorina pointedly refused to choose a candidate for the $10 bill. Although her stated reasoning was that doing so was nothing more than a ""gesture"" that wasn't worth her consideration, it was hard not to hear an unspoken suggestion hanging in the air during her answer: ""How about the first woman president? I bet my face would look <em>great</em> on a $10 bill.""</p> \n<h3>VIDEO: Carly Fiorina responds to Donald Trump's personal attack</h3> \n<!--  ########  BEGIN VOLUME VIDEO  ########  --> \n<div class=""volume-video"" id=""volume-placement-655"" data-volume-placement=""article"" data-analytics-placement=""article:middle"" data-volume-id=""4311"" data-volume-uuid=""6f80a1345"" data-analytics-label=""Fiorina responds to Trump's personal attack | 4311"" data-analytics-action=""volume:view:article:middle"" data-analytics-viewport=""video""></div> \n<!--  ########  END VOLUME VIDEO  ########  -->",Politics

Mind control? Oh yes. Say goodbye to freedom, sheeple.</p> \n<p>While our minds are still our own, let's trace this story back a few years, as it is quite illustrative of the larger arc of Obama's presidency.</p> \n<h3>Early attempts at government mind control were thwarted by Glenn Beck</h3> \n<p>Several years ago, I became temporarily obsessed with behavioral psychology and its potential contributions to the energy field. (See further reading at the bottom.) Insights into how human beings make decisions in real-life circumstances can help boost conservation, reduce waste, and ease adoption of new technology.

The <a href=""http://dailycaller.com/2015/09/15/president-obama-orders-behavioral-experiments-on-american-public/"">Daily Caller</a> works in a few dark insinuations, but no high dudgeon. Even the <a href=""http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/09/15/obama-issues-executive-order-government-use-behavioral-data/"">Breitbart piece</a> is pretty straightforward. The best I could find is a kind of half-hearted belch of protest from Podhoretz:</p> \n<blockquote lang=""en"" class=""twitter-tweet""> \n<p lang=""en"" dir=""ltr"">Oh, great.

That's it?</p> \n<p>Honestly, the far-right outrage machine seems a little exhausted these days. They can't block Congress any more than it's blocked. Their opposition to anything Obama does is so predictable that no one, Obama included, cares any more. And they can't stop executive actions anyway, as their recent defeats on the Clean Power Plan and the Iran Deal make clear. So they just watch, stew, and think about 2016, when they'll have a chance to elect someone who will reverse everything Obama has done.</p> \n<h3>Mind control will become even more important in coming years as energy decentralizes</h3> \n<p>The intersection of behavioral psychology and energy is going to get extremely hot in the next few years. As I've described in <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/9/11/9306247/utilities-21st-century"">previous posts</a>, the electricity system is evolving from a centralized, one-way model to a decentralized, multi-directional model. Customers will be producing energy, storing it, selling it, and shopping for just the kind of backup power they want (based on carbon emissions, geographic origin, etc.). Their appliances and cars and buildings will all be connected to and communicating with the grid.</p> \n<p>It's exciting, but also somewhat perilous. With all these new technologies and opportunities come lots and lots of <i>decisions</i>. Customers will be much more actively engaged with energy, rather than just passive consumers.</p> \n<p>And here's the thing: people are lazy. Decisions are exhausting. Generally, we prefer to minimize decisionmaking, not expand it.</p> \n<p>Right now electricity is invisible, reasonably cheap, and above all, easy. Once a month you pay the bill. The rest just happens.</p> \n<p>If distributed and clean energy enthusiasts want customers to engage more with electricity systems, they're going to have to customers them into it. They're going to have to make the process really, really easy, even fun, and include incentives that make it worth the effort.</p> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""4072666"">\n<img src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4072666/fried.jpg""> \n<div class=""caption""> \n<p>An unsuccessful interaction with home energy technology.</p> \n</div> \n</div> \n<p>That will require some thoughtful product design, informed by good behavioral science. The interface between individuals and energy systems — not just technologies, but financing and business mechanisms as well — is the axle on which everything else in distributed energy turns.</p> \n<p>If you blunder into consumer homes with a few misguided, poorly designed ""smart grid"" technologies (see, e.g., the <a href=""http://www.essex.ac.uk/news/event.aspx?e_id=7227"">disastrous rollout</a> of smart meters in the UK), you're quickly going to turn them off to the whole enterprise.</p> \n<p>Traditionally, the electricity sector has been dominated by engineers and bureaucrats — not exactly the sort of people you'd turn to for insights about customer experience. As the smart grid takes off and new <a href=""http://grist.org/article/whats-threatening-utilities-innovation-at-the-edge-of-the-grid/"">grid-edge opportunities</a> open up, it's extremely important that customer-facing programs and technologies draw on good behavioral science. Maybe Obama's new mind-control team can give them some pointers.</p> \n<h3>Further reading</h3> \n<p>A few posts I did on behavioral psychology and energy:</p> \n<ul> \n<li><a href=""http://grist.org/article/2009-11-23-making-buildings-more-efficient-looking-beyond-price"" target=""_blank"">Making buildings more efficient: looking beyond price</a></li> \n<li><a href=""http://grist.org/article/2009-11-30-making-buildings-efficient-it-helps-to-understand-human-behavior"" target=""_blank"">Making buildings more efficient: It helps to understand human behavior</a></li> \n<li><a href=""http://grist.org/article/2010-01-12-never-mind-what-people-believe-how-can-we-change-what-they-do"" target=""_blank"">Never mind what people believe — how can we change what they do?

Is the pope changing minds on climate change? Survey says: meh.,http://www.vox.com/2015/9/18/9353423/pope-climate-game,Everyone paying attention has already made up their mind.,"<p>Pope Francis's <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/6/24/8834413/pope-climate-change-encyclical"">entry</a> into the contentious debate over climate change was welcomed by many climate hawks as a ""<a href=""http://ecowatch.com/2015/07/27/pope-francis-visit-us/"">gamechanger</a>."" For months, people whose <i>own</i> minds were not changed by the pope's encyclical, <i>Laudato Si</i>, have been confidently claiming that many <i>other</i> people's will be. I've yet to actually hear from, or even hear about, an actual human being whose mind was thus changed.</p> \n<p>I was discussing this on Twitter when, lo and behold, a fellow from the organization <a href=""http://www.faithinpubliclife.org/"">Faith In Public Life</a> overheard and sent me a <a href=""http://www.faithinpubliclife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/FrancisEffectReport.pdf"">recent survey</a> they did on just this question — or rather, on the broader question of how the pope is influencing American Catholics.</p> \n<h3>A poll shows that US Catholics dig Francis</h3> \n<p>It is obviously too early to guess at the long-term effects of the pope's leadership; it will take time for his shift in emphasis to work its way down into the parishes and schools where Catholic doctrine is conveyed. But this survey — with design help from the Institute for Policy Research &amp; Catholic Studies at The Catholic University of America, conducted by YouGov — offers some interesting hints.</p> \n<p>Broadly, it finds that American Catholics approve of the pope and the direction he's taking the church. Though there is some partisan difference, the number is pretty high across the board:</p> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""4073936""><img src=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4073936/fipl-francis-approval.png""></div> \n<p>There are some interesting specific results (Latino Catholics love Francis's talk about the government's role in addressing poverty and homelessness), but naturally what I really want to hear about is climate change.</p> \n<h3>But the same poll shows his climate change message isn't doing much</h3> \n<p>One of the survey experiments was set up like this: half the participants read a message about the urgency of climate change from ""climate scientists""; the other half read a similar message from Pope Francis. The idea was to run this on various groups of Catholics to find out which, if any, would be uniquely moved by the pope's message.</p> \n<p>Here's the relevant result:</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>Catholic Republicans who read about <i>Laudato Si</i> were more likely to agree that human activities are responsible for climate change (37%) than those who received the alternative message (27%), and to agree that humans have a moral duty [to protect the environment] (77%) than those who read the story featuring generic climate experts (70%).</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>That seems like a pretty modest effect. But okay, it's movement. Then again, there's this:</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>It is worth noting that differences were more modest (and statistically insignificant) when it came to agreeing that the U.S. government needs to take action: 33% among those who read about Laudato Si, and 30% among those who read the alternative message.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Sigh.</p> \n<p>FPL spins this as the pope changing the conversation, but that seems like a wild over-interpretation of some pretty sketchy, short-term data. The pope nudged a few conservatives to think climate might be a problem, which doesn't threaten any of their core tribal commitments. But when it comes to climate requiring a government ... sorry, Big Government solution, which very much <i>is</i> a core tribal commitment, there was no movement at all.</p> \n<h3>Partisanship is stronger than religion in America</h3> \n<p>I'm afraid this just plays to my cynicism. My thesis is pretty simple: in the US today, partisanship is a stronger force than religion. The latter is shaped to fit the former, not the other way around.</p> \n<p>To illustrate the point, I give you <a href=""http://townhall.com/columnists/congressmanpaulgosar/2015/09/17/why-i-am-boycotting-pope-francis-address-to-congress-n2053596/page/full"">Republican Congressman Paul Gosar</a>, who is a ""proud Catholic"" but is boycotting the pope's address to Congress:</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>Media reports indicate His Holiness instead intends to focus the brunt of his speech on climate change--a climate that has been changing since first created in Genesis. More troubling is the fact that this climate change talk has adopted all of the socialist talking points, wrapped false science and ideology into ""climate justice"" and is being presented to guilt people into leftist policies. If the Pope stuck to standard Christian theology, I would be the first in line. If the Pope spoke out with moral authority against violent Islam, I would be there cheering him on. If the Pope urged the Western nations to rescue persecuted Christians in the Middle East, I would back him wholeheartedly. But when the Pope chooses to act and talk like a leftist politician, then he can expect to be treated like one.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>To paraphrase: if the pope wants to reinforce my pre-existing ideological commitments, I'll listen to him; if he wants to challenge them, I'll ignore him.</p> \n<p>That is basically the attitude toward the pope I expected across the American right and nothing I've seen yet convinces me otherwise.</p> \n<p>Again: it's probably unfair to judge the pope's shift on climate change by whether it instantly changes the mind of opponents or transforms politics. Insofar as the ""game"" is current politics and the international climate talks coming up in Paris, no, the pope will not change the game.</p> \n<p>Over the longer term? As the pope's teachings work their way through churches and schools across the world? Maybe. We'll see. But for now, game ain't changed.</p> \n<p>---</p> \n<h3>Update</h3> \n<p>Aaaand a guy at the Heartland Institute just said that Pope Francis is <a href=""http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/gene-koprowski-pope-francis-environment-paganism"" target=""_blank"">smuggling pagan nature-worship back into the church</a>. So there's that.</p>",Politics
"AP says to call climate deniers ""climate doubters."" Whatever.",http://www.vox.com/2015/9/24/9393217/ap-climate-doubters-truthers,"Doesn't much matter what they're called, as long as they're understood.","<p>The AP stylebook, bible to journalists everywhere, has made an <a href=""https://blog.ap.org/announcements/an-addition-to-ap-stylebook-entry-on-global-warming"">official ruling</a> on the perpetually vexing question of what to call that hardy band of (mainly <a href=""http://grist.org/climate-skeptics/2011-08-02-stuff-white-people-like-denying-climate-change/"">older, white, conservative</a>, American) folks who reject the findings of mainstream climate science.</p> \n<p>For a long time they were called ""skeptics,"" but eventually that started to irritate climate scientists. Science is, after all, just operational skepticism. But when one retains skepticism long after it is warranted, one is no longer a skeptic, one is in <em>denial</em>.</p> \n<p>So then ""denier"" became the term of art among the more sharp-elbowed climate hawks. But that irritated climate deniers, who claimed that the term is meant to associate them with Holocaust deniers, and if climate deniers hate anything, it's <a href=""http://mediamatters.org/video/2006/05/24/fox-guest-likened-al-gores-an-inconvenient-trut/135785"">unfair comparisons</a> with <a href=""http://www.cc.com/video-clips/04rkt0/the-daily-show-with-jon-stewart-back-in-black---glenn-beck-s-nazi-tourette-s"">Nazis</a> or <a href=""http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2012/05/04/477921/heartland-institute-compares-climate-science-believers-and-reporters-to-mass-murderers-and-madmen/"">mass murderers</a>.</p> \n<p>AP, in its Solomonic wisdom, has elected to eschew both terms. Instead it's going with ""climate change doubter,"" or alternatively, ""those who reject mainstream climate science,"" which trips right off the tongue.</p> \n<p>Predictably, this pleased no one, as the replies under this tweet illustrate:</p> \n<p> \n<script src=""//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"" charset=""utf-8""></script> \n</p> \n<blockquote class=""twitter-tweet"" lang=""en""> \n<p lang=""en"" dir=""ltr"">AP Style tip: For those who don’t accept climate science or dispute world is warming from man-made forces, use climate change doubters.</p> \n— AP Stylebook (@APStylebook) <a href=""https://twitter.com/APStylebook/status/646388986487926784"">September 22, 2015</a>\n</blockquote> \n<p>My hot take: It doesn't really matter. Nothing of particular consequence rests on what journalists choose to call these people. Certainly nothing that would justify the endless hours of debate that have been devoted to it.</p> \n<p>Personally, I like the term ""climate truthers,"" which better captures the flavor of the thing. It's not like ""those who reject mainstream climate science"" all have the same story about <em>why</em> they reject it. There are dozens of varieties of counter-theories, as many as there are theories about Kennedy's assassination. What unites them all is a conviction that the official story <em>can't be right</em>, that it's covering for a nefarious agenda, that the truth is out there.</p> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""4093740"">\n<img src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4093740/kitty-truther.jpg""> \n<div class=""caption""> \n<p>The truth is meow't there.</p> \n</div> \n</div> \n<p>But really, use whatever term you want. All the huffing and puffing and language policing is tiresome.</p> \n<p>What is important is properly comprehending the phenomenon itself. And key to that is understanding that it's not primarily about climate science at all, but about tribal affiliations, reinforced through a process called <a href=""http://www.scienceandreligiontoday.com/2011/05/04/what-is-motivated-reasoning-and-how-does-it-work/"">motivated reasoning</a>.</p> \n<h3>Conclusions are usually the beginning, not the end, of human reasoning</h3> \n<p>The popular conception of reason is that it poses a question, gathers evidence, weighs the evidence, and draws a conclusion. But that turns out to be a highly idealized conception, tracing back to positivism and the Enlightenment.</p> \n<p>In fact, human beings are not primarily rational creatures. We are primarily <em>social</em> creatures. We are born into specific social contexts, overlapping tribes from which we absorb our worldviews and values. We stitch our identities together out of those tribal affiliations. Most of what we believe, we do not conclude. We do not reason to it at all. We <em>inherit</em> it.</p> \n<p>Those inherited beliefs are often tribal markers, conditions of approbation, even acceptance, among our tribes. Because belonging to tribes is fundamental to our well-being, those markers become very important to us. Protecting them is adaptive behavior, among our most basic instincts.</p> \n<p>And protect them we do, via what social scientist Dan Kahan calls ""identity-protective cognition."" (Ezra Klein wrote about it <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/4/6/5556462/brain-dead-how-politics-makes-us-stupid"">here</a>.) We are primed to resist information that casts doubt on our core beliefs and values. Such resistance is deeply rooted, often operating at a level beneath conscious awareness.</p> \n<p>So reasoning in the real world is usually the opposite of the idealized conception. Rather than ask questions and reason to conclusions, what most of us do, most of the time, is begin with conclusions and reason to justifications. We use our cognitive powers to build a case for what we are already inclined, for reasons of tribal affiliation, to believe. To use the analogy favored by psychologist Jonathan Haidt (via <a href=""http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2011/03/denial-science-chris-mooney"">Chris Mooney</a>), we think we're being scientists, but we're actually being lawyers.</p> \n<p>That's motivated reasoning. It's not a flaw, a weakness, or an exception. It's likely what cognition is <em>for</em>. After all, why would evolution select for a species of pure reasoning machines? Beyond our ability to successfully navigate our immediate surroundings, we don't really <em>need</em> accurate information, certainly not at the level of basic worldviews. It doesn't have a ton of adaptive value.</p> \n<p>What does have adaptive value is our ability to access the benefits of community, to enter into reciprocal relationships with others around us for mutual benefit. That's what evolutionary pressures are likely to select for — the master to which reasoning is a servant.</p> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""4093766"">\n<img src=""https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4093766/tribe.jpg""> \n<div class=""caption""> \n<p>""We're wrong, but we're wrong <em>together</em>!""</p> \n</div> \n</div> \n<p>This is not to say that inquiry is futile. It is possible to make self-criticism and self-correction themselves tribal values, to encourage the cognitive effort (and cushion the social risk) of skepticism. It is possible for individuals to develop, through practice, the mental habits of self-analysis and openness to revision. And science itself is, of course, an attempt to formalize those mental habits and be rigorous in their use. But it's <em>difficult</em> to reason that way, exhausting both intellectually and psychologically, so most people, most times, don't.</p> \n<p>Now, motivated reasoning is strikingly easy to recognize ... in other people, who disagree with you. It is much more difficult to recognize when you and your cohort do it. But all tribes are guilty of it.</p> \n<p>Nonetheless, it's facile to conclude that ""everyone does it"" and leave it there. Some tribes and individuals are more prone to it than others, and in varying amounts on different issues and in different circumstances.</p> \n<h3>Climate denialism is identity protection on the American right</h3> \n<p>Which brings us back to the climate truthers. What's happened is that rejection of mainstream climate science has become a powerful tribal marker in the US conservative movement.</p> \n<p>And it is mostly the US conservative movement. As Jonathan Chait pointed out in his <a href=""http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2015/09/sunniest-climate-change-story-ever-read.html"">recent piece</a>, there are smatterings of similar science rejection in Australia and in European splinter parties, but nowhere else in the developed world has climate, er, <em>doubt</em> taken over a major political party. It is, as he says, ""a regional quirk in the most powerful country on Earth.""</p> \n<p>The question of how exactly the truthers' disposition toward climate science might best be described — skepticism, doubt, paranoid hostility, whatever — is beside the point; what's going on has little to do with how they assess climate science. The story of climate trutherism is not primarily about science at all, or even about climate change. It is <a href=""http://grist.org/article/2010-09-09-the-rights-climate-denialism-is-part-of-something-much-larger/"">part of something much larger</a>, a story of how the US right became radicalized, aggrieved, empowered, and epistemically insular.

More shipwrecked rigs, perhaps, or a nightmarish spill that proved impossible to clean up.</p> \n<p>But on Monday, Shell <a href=""http://www.shell.com/global/aboutshell/media/news-and-media-releases/2015/shell-updates-on-alaska-exploration.html"">announced</a> that it was abandoning its controversial Arctic drilling plans for a much more prosaic reason: The company simply hadn't found enough oil and gas to justify further exploration ""for the foreseeable future.""</p> \n<p>At this point, Shell has spent at least $7 billion since 2008 buying up leases and trying to drill exploratory wells in the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas, north of Alaska. It's a remote and forbidding environment, with dangerous ice floes and frequent storms. But geologists believe there could be <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.cfm?id=21632"">up to 40 billion barrels</a> of technically recoverable oil beneath these waters, enough to supply the entire United States for five years.

Most of Shell's competitors, including Tota, had long ago shelved their plans to drill in the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas, deeming it too risky and difficult.

But at a time when </span><a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/12/16/7401705/oil-prices-falling"">global oil prices have plummeted</a><span>, from $100 per barrel last summer to around $45 per barrel now, Shell has now decided it's simply no longer worth the endless headaches.</span></p> \n<h3>An end to the Arctic drilling controversy — for now</h3> \n<p>The announcement puts an end, for now, to the longstanding controversy over Shell's drilling forays.</p> \n<p><span>Shell first acquired leases in the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas back in 2008, under the Bush administration, at a time when global oil prices were soaring upward of $100 per barrel and summer sea ice in the Arctic was receding due to global warming. The company hoped it could surmount the considerable technical challenges (and costs) in order to unlock massive new reserves of oil and gas.</span></p> \n<p>Since then, the company has faced setback after setback. Conservation and native groups filed multiple lawsuits, arguing that Shell's response plans in the event of an oil spill were insufficient. (If a major <em>spill</em> did happen, it would be difficult for a response team to reach this icy and remote region.) Then, in 2011, Shell's efforts to drill two initial exploratory wells <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/9/2/9248593/shell-arctic-drilling-obama"">ended in utter fiasco</a>, when, among other mishaps, gale-force winds caused one of its drill ships to run aground. As a result, the Obama administration put strict new rules in place to restrict how and when Shell could drill.</p> \n<p>By the time this summer came around, Shell had gone seven years without successfully drilling a single wells and wanted to try again. Environmentalists urged President Obama to block those efforts, <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/9/2/9248593/shell-arctic-drilling-obama"">arguing that it made no sense</a> to open up new areas to fossil fuel extraction at a time when the world is hoping to stop global warming. In August, the Obama administration sided with Shell and gave the company the go-ahead to drill, before Arctic sea ice started growing again in the fall.</p> \n<p>In the end, however, it didn't matter. Shell got to drill its exploratory well and didn't find enough oil and gas. So it's giving up. There will be no more Shell Alaska controversy for now.</p> \n<p><span>Shell said its decision was based on ""</span><span>the Burger J well result, the high costs associated with the project, and the challenging and unpredictable federal regulatory environment in offshore Alaska."" On the latter point, note that Hillary Clinton has said she would oppose Shell's offshore drilling efforts if she became president. </span></p> \n<p>The company is also expecting to take a financial charge on the move: ""The balance sheet carrying value of Shell's Alaska position is approximately $3.0 billion, with approximately a further $1.1 billion of future contractual commitments.""</p> \n<h3>Will anyone ever successfully drill for oil in the Arctic Ocean?</h3> \n<p>At this point, it's unclear if anyone will ever<em> </em>come back to drill for oil in the Chukchi or Beaufort Seas. A lot depends on what global supply and demand look like in the future.</p> \n<p>Most of the other oil companies had been waiting to see if Shell could overcome the steep hurdles and succeed in tapping Arctic oil. That obviously hasn't happened. Earlier this year, Ann Pickard, Shell's top executive for the Arctic, <a href=""http://www.wsj.com/articles/shell-places-huge-bet-on-arctic-oil-riches-1436311938"">told</a> the Wall Street Journal: ""If we fail for whatever reason … I think the US is another 25 years"" away from developing oil and gas in the Arctic.</p> \n<p>And what about the rest of the Arctic Ocean? Efforts to drill in Russia's portion <a href=""http://www.brookings.edu/blogs/order-from-chaos/posts/2015/08/27-russia-arctic-geopolitics-baev#.VeXTRUWR0_Q.twitter"">have been hampered</a> by low oil prices (as well as by US and EU sanctions). Meanwhile, up in the Barents Sea, north of Norway, Eni has been trying to produce oil, but those plans <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304908304579565753307108212"">have been bogged down</a> in cost overruns, delays, and other logistical challenges.</p> \n<p>Presumably if oil prices ever surge again worldwide, the Arctic Ocean could once again seem more appealing. Shell has long said that oil prices would need to rise to around $70 per barrel by 2030 for drilling in the Chukchi to be worthwhile. That scenario is hardly unthinkable. Oil demand from China and Europe is currently growing more slowly than expected, but it could easily pick up again. Likewise, if the United States ever ends up exhausting its shale oil resources, the untapped Arctic may get a second look.</p> \n<p>Ultimately, it all comes down to demand for oil. If companies think it's worth the risk, they'll likely come back in a few decades and try to push into the Arctic. If, by contrast, the world succeeds in finding alternatives to oil (<a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/9/25/9398063/self-driving-electric-cars"" target=""_blank"">electric cars</a>, anyone?), then they won't.</p> \n<h3>Further reading:</h3> \n<p> </p> \n<ul> \n<li> <span>Here's </span><a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/9/2/9248593/shell-arctic-drilling-obama"" target=""_blank"">our longer guide</a><span> to the controversy over Shell's Arctic drilling, including a look at why Obama and environmentalists disagreed over the global warming impact.</span> </li> \n<li> <span>In the Financial Times, Nick Butler </span><a target=""_blank"" href=""http://blogs.ft.com/nick-butler/2015/09/28/beyond-the-arctic-what-next-for-shell-and-the-majors/"">has a smart column</a><span> on Shell's decision.

Jeb Bush's low-energy energy plan,http://www.vox.com/2015/10/1/9430867/jeb-low-energy-plan,It lacks a certain something.,"<p>Jeb Bush is seeking, <a href=""http://www.politico.com/story/2015/09/jeb-bush-energy-climate-change-fossil-fuels-214241"">Politico says</a>, to ""add policy heft to his campaign."" So he's released an <a href=""https://jeb2016.com/policy-energy-plan/?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=energy_medium_social_20150929_e_v1&amp;lang=en"">energy plan</a>. Of sorts.</p> \n<p>The plan is just over 1,000 words long, fitting easily on one page. If that's too much policy heft for you, there's also a convenient <a href=""https://jeb2016.com/jebs-energy-policies-for-growth/"">summary</a> that comes in at under 300 words and fits even more easily on one page.</p> \n<p>As energy policy, it's mostly vaporware. Even if it were all put in place tomorrow, it would have very little effect on the larger trends and forces at work in the energy world. But as politics, it is quite revealing.</p> \n<p>In economic policy, Republican orthodoxy never changes, no matter how the world might change around it. Whether there's a tech boom, a recession, low deficits, high deficits, low unemployment, high unemployment — the answer is always tax cuts on upper income brackets. The same is true of energy: whether clean energy is expensive or cheap, whether oil prices are high or low, whether climate change is a pressing issue or not — the answer is always more fossil fuel extraction.</p> \n<p>And so, just as Jeb Bush's <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/9/8/9285421/jeb-bush-tax-plan"">tax plan</a> features the same debt-financed tax cuts his big brother pushed when in office, his energy policy features the same unstinting support for fossil fuels. And his is the consensus position; there is no disagreement within the GOP on energy.</p> \n<h3>The reason GOP energy policy is so predictable</h3> \n<p>Republican energy policy proposals are created under two constraints, which together render them utterly predictable.</p> \n<p>The first is conservative ideology. Over the last few decades, conservative preference for ""small government"" has become more and more rigid and simplistic. It has reached the point now where the basic conservative reflex is to decry the government doing <em>anything</em> — taxing, spending, or regulating, which together pretty much exhaust the possibilities for domestic policy.</p> \n<p>So GOP candidates can't promise to do anything when they take over the federal government. All they can promise is to <em>undo</em> things — reduce taxes and spending and repeal regulations.</p> \n<p>Yet the public has goals and desires. And they want their politicians to help achieve those goals and desires. Since Republicans can't promise to do anything proactive, they are forced to promise that <em>un</em>doing things would achieve those goals and desires, whatever they may be. They have to pretend (or, who knows, maybe really believe) that government is not only <em>a</em> problem, but <em>every</em> problem, the sole reason the public is not getting what it wants, whether it's cleaner energy or more jobs.</p> \n<p>These plans are always advanced under a heavy sheen of forward-looking, heroic rhetoric about dynamism and growth and right-to-rise, but underneath, the policy is always the same: cutting taxes on the wealthy, reducing social spending, and unwinding regulations that inhibit corporate profits.</p> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""4113960"">\n<img src=""https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4113960/jeb-bush-jeb-jeb-jeb.jpg""> \n<div class=""caption""> \n<p>In Florida, they call him Jeb! because he earned it.</p> \n</div> \n</div> \n<p>That constraint alone might yield a somewhat <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/5/13/8594727/conservative-carbon-tax"">libertarian energy policy</a>. But it's not the only constraint. The other is the enormous power of fossil fuel money within the GOP, which shapes policy as surely as any ideology. Thus: only taxes on fossil fuels may be reduced; only spending on clean energy may be reduced; only regulations that constrain fossil fuels may be repealed. And so it goes, in practice. (""<a href=""http://www.ibtimes.com/jeb-bush-energy-plan-most-benefits-his-top-donors-2119743"">Jeb Bush Energy Plan Most Benefits His Top Donors</a>,"" notes the International Business Times.)</p> \n<p>Bush's energy plan, substantially similar to what other GOP candidates have said about energy, shows what is possible within those constraints. It's not much.</p> \n<h3>The Bush plan's four-pronged strategy for boosting fossil fuels</h3> \n<p>Here are the four planks of the plan.</p> \n<ol> \n<li> <strong>Lift Restrictions on Exports of Oil and Natural Gas:</strong> For some reason, lifting the ban on crude oil exports has become a cause célèbre among Republicans, even though its effects are likely to be <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonkblog/wp/2014/01/08/u-s-oil-exports-have-been-banned-for-40-years-is-it-time-for-that-to-change/"">modest</a>. It would help some crude producers and hurt some refineries (which benefit from lower domestic oil prices), but in the grand scheme of things, its impact on the US economy and energy situation would be dwarfed by, say, another big swing in oil prices. Similarly, allowing export of liquid natural gas would have <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonkblog/wp/2012/12/06/natural-gas-exports-could-boost-u-s-economy-but-will-anyone-even-buy-the-stuff/"">mixed effects</a>. It might boost the fortunes of some fracking companies, but it might also raise the price of US natural gas, which could hurt domestic manufacturing. There's also the distinct possibility that there's not much market for exported LNG at all, so lifting the ban might make no difference. As this <a href=""http://blogs.cfr.org/levi/2012/12/05/thoughts-on-a-long-awaited-natural-gas-exports-study/"">Michael Levi study</a> demonstrates, ""either way, all of the macro numbers are pretty small."" This is red meat to conservatives but marginal, at best, as energy policy.</li> \n<li> <strong>Approve the Keystone XL Pipeline:</strong><strong> </strong>By now, this debate has been done to death. (Brad Plumer covered it pretty comprehensively <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/11/14/7216751/keystone-pipeline-facts-controversy"">here</a>, if you still need a primer.) Suffice to say, GOP claims about the pipeline's effects on GDP and employment are almost comically exaggerated — and even if they were true, would still be comparatively tiny in an economy America's size. This has become a symbolic football, but as energy policy, it just doesn't matter much. Low oil prices are <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/03/business/energy-environment/lower-oil-prices-strike-at-heart-of-oil-sands-production.html?_r=0"">crushing Canadian tar sands oil</a>; those effects vastly outweigh any effect the pipeline might have.</li> \n<li> <strong>Reduce Overregulation:</strong> This section is mostly hand-waving, except for the specific promise to repeal Obama's Clean Power Plan (something every GOP candidate has pledged). Bush does reference his <a href=""https://jeb2016.com/reformandgrowth/?lang=en"">bigger plan on overregulation</a>, which was released last week. That plan would effectively make federal climate regulation impossible, among its other malign effects. It would have likely have bigger effects on energy than anything in Bush's energy plan, mainly in service of further entrenching the fossil fuel status quo.</li> \n<li> <strong>Defer to Willing States and Tribes:</strong> This is code for allowing states to drill and mine in federally protected areas, which would be good for (specific companies in) those states, but would make only a modest difference in overall US production.</li> \n</ol> \n<p>That's it.</p> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""4113964"">\n<img src=""https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4113964/bush.jpg""> \n<div class=""caption""> \n<p>A bush.</p> \n</div> \n</div> \n<h3>What's left out of Bush's plan</h3> \n<p>Bush's plan is mostly political, a selection of conservative hot-button issues that would have only marginal effects on energy. It would not ""unleash an energy revolution"" or even much affect the energy revolutions already underway.</p> \n<p>However, it is notable for what it omits. As <a href=""http://www.politico.com/story/2015/09/jeb-bush-energy-climate-change-fossil-fuels-214241"">Darren Goode points out</a>, there's no mention of the fact that Bush himself opposed offshore drilling as governor of Florida. There's no mention of climate change at all, despite the (<a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/5/26/8654265/jeb-bush-climate-change"">tepid, hedged</a>) attention Bush has given to that issue in the past. There's <em>nothing</em> about clean energy, which is pretty remarkable for an energy plan in 2015.</p> \n<p>And there's no mention of repealing fossil fuel subsidies, which Bush was <a href=""http://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/248941-jeb-bush-calls-for-ending-subsidies-for-energy-including-oil-and"">touting</a> just a few months ago. Or is there? Here's an oblique reference:</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>In addition, we must create a level playing field for all energy sources including, but not limited to, nuclear, renewables, coal, natural gas, oil and alternative fuels. We unnecessarily drive up energy costs on Americans when we play favorites and suppress the dynamism of free markets.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>This is ... something, I guess. It'll be interesting to see if Bush sticks with it. (Spoiler: no GOP Congress will ever repeal oil subsidies. Indeed Congressional Republicans already <a href=""http://www.cnn.com/2012/03/29/politics/oil-subsidies/"">declined to do so</a>. Most talk about ""not choosing winners"" is code for repealing assistance to fossil fuel competitors. Also, repealing all energy subsidies would be both <a href=""http://grist.org/article/2011-01-07-is-eliminating-energy-subsidies-politically-realistic"">impossible</a> and a <a href=""http://grist.org/article/2011-01-06-should-we-get-rid-of-all-energy-subsidies/"">terrible idea</a>.)</p> \n<p>To me, the incoherence of the contemporary conservative approach to energy is perfectly represented by this paragraph:</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>Further, producers and consumers must have better access to new technologies such as ""intelligent"" electricity management devices, unconventional transportation fuels, advanced nuclear power designs and cutting-edge energy conservation methods. We must remove burdensome government regulations, subsidies and other barriers that get in the way of adopting and exploiting such innovations.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>#lolsob, as the kids say. All those new technologies are indeed great. And to the extent they've caught on at all in the face of the entrenched market power of fossil fuel incumbents, it is <em>thanks to regulations and subsidies</em>. If they are to grow from niche to mainstream technologies, it will be thanks to regulations and subsidies. In many cases, markets don't even exist for these technologies and must be kickstarted by policy. The idea that cutting edge energy technologies are held back by ""burdensome government regulations"" is just fantastical. But it's the one hammer Bush has got, so everything looks like a nail.</p> \n<p>Bush promises to ""release additional proposals that will complement our status as an energy superpower by revitalizing our position as the superpower of energy innovation."" Among other things, he says ""we can further accelerate the discovery of game-changing technologies by boosting funding for high-priority basic research and increasing the effectiveness of our national labs.""</p> \n<p>Federal energy research funding is indeed <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonkblog/wp/2013/04/09/three-charts-that-show-the-u-s-spends-too-little-on-energy-research/"">abysmally low</a>. If Bush made increasing it a priority, that would be something genuinely new and laudable in the GOP energy world. But if it's just a bunch of new tax breaks for ""clean coal"" and fracking, it will only demonstrate again how little is possible given the constraints under which GOP energy policy is made.</p>",Politics
What SNL got right â€” and wrong â€” in this brilliant fake ad about bad presidential candidates,http://www.vox.com/2015/10/4/9449103/what-snl-got-right-and-wrong-in-this-brilliant-fake-ad-about-bad,Watch the clip.,"<p>The season debut of <i>Saturday Night Live</i> featured a wickedly funny fake drug commercial that perfectly nails the self-delusion of some presidential candidates: believing that you'll win, even when all the evidence says you've got no chance in hell.</p> \n<p><iframe width=""560"" height=""315"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/GIYEGDJoluc"" frameborder=""0""></iframe></p> \n<p>At first, it's not clear where the fake ad is headed. A woman tells the camera that she's concerned about her husband's ""mental illness."" That he's ""say[ing] things that didn't make any sense."" Then the camera pulls back and reveals: The woman is Rick Santorum's wife, watching her husband declare that he'll be our next president.</p> \n<p>""That's when I knew. He had dementia,"" the fake Karen Santorum moans, as SNL's audience laughs.</p> \n<p>The wives of Jim Gilmore and Mike Huckabee are similarly bereaved, until all three men start taking a new drug — ""Abilify for Candidates"" — that cures their presidential delusions. SNL's clips of the fake candidates are pure fiction, but it's not that far from real life.</p> \n<p>""I'm ready to lead this country,"" the actual Rick Santorum said in a speech last week, as he campaigned to win the GOP presidential nomination. ""I've got experience to do it, the backbone to do it, and the vision to do it.""</p> \n<h3>Why candidates with low odds run for our highest office</h3> \n<p>Santorum may be ready to lead, but the country may not be ready for him. The former senator placed 12th in recent polls of GOP candidates, and he has virtually no national support. Of course, Santorum has company: At one point this summer, there were <a target=""new"" href=""http://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2015/6/9/8716137/2016-presidential-candidates-guide"">17 major candidates</a> in the Republican race, all of whom professed to be the best person for the job ... even though a dozen of them were receiving 3 percent or less support in the polls. And that's what SNL was poking fun at.</p> \n<p>""Prescribed for 11 specific people,"" the fake drug's tagline reads. ""Return to reality. Feel less confused. Feel happy and sane.""</p> \n<p>The spoof is brilliant for skewering the delusion necessary to run for president — the conviction that yes, a Rhode Island governor with zero percent national support, or a doctor who's never held public office, are somehow ready to win the nation's most important job. And SNL's sketch also contains an Easter egg that health-care wonks will appreciate. There really is an Abilify — an antipsychotic drug used to treat schizophrenia — with an identical logo, albeit with no American flag colors. (SNL took further creative license and shortened the name of Abilify's active ingredient from aripiprazole to just arirazole. In case you were wondering.)</p> \n<blockquote class=""twitter-tweet"" lang=""en""> \n<p lang=""en"" dir=""ltr"">Not everyone can be the president.

Even if they believe they truly are the best person to lead the nation, many politicians tell themselves it's okay being a runner-up, because the exposure of running for president tends to be career-enhancing.</p> \n<p>This delusional duality is perfectly captured in <i>What It Takes</i>, Richard Ben Cramer's epic chronicle of the 1988 presidential campaign. Cramer follows a half-dozen presidential candidates as they stump, schmooze, and scheme to win the presidency. Here's a telling passage about then-Missouri Rep. Dick Gephardt, who was a second-tier candidate in that year's Democratic primaries:</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>Of course he wanted to win—wouldn't have tried if he didn't think he could. But when he started... Dick Gephardt didn't think he could lose. Not that he thought himself inexorable victor — no, the odds were always against him. But if he just did well, if he ran a decent race... he'd have to end up better. A national figure, a force for the future!</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Gephardt was right: Although he dropped out of the race after being thumped on Super Tuesday, Gephardt's higher profile helped him win the job of House Majority Leader the following year.</p> \n<p>There's also another key factor. The spotlight that comes with a presidential campaign is addictive, which is one reason so many also-rans seem to keep running again and again.</p> \n<p>Just look at another candidate profiled in <i>What It Takes</i>: Joe Biden. The 1988 presidential campaign was rough on Biden. He was caught badly plagiarizing a speech, followed by allegations that he plagiarized in law school. As his poll numbers began to plummet, Biden dropped out of the race in September, stressed out and politically damaged. Just a few months later, he suffered two brain aneurysms. (Biden did better when he ran for president in 2008, but not by much: he barely broke 1 percent in the Iowa caucus in January, and quit the race that night.)</p> \n<p>Yet Biden refuses to rule out running this year — despite every indication that he'd get clobbered by entering the race so late.</p> \n<p>But who can blame him? For a politician, being in the national political conversation is intoxicating. The thrill of running another presidential campaign distorts reality. And there's no drug that cures those symptoms — except on SNL.</p>",Politics
New York's revolutionary plan to remake its power utilities,http://www.vox.com/2015/10/5/9453131/new-york-utilities-rev,"Under the leadership of Gov. Andrew Cuomo, New York is undertaking an astonishingly comprehensive and ambitious effort to remake its energy systems and reduce its carbon emissions.","<p>By now, many people are aware of the <a href=""http://grist.org/climate-energy/utilities-vs-rooftop-solar-what-the-fight-is-about/"">ongoing battles</a> between customers with rooftop solar panels and power utilities around the country. At first blush, this can look like a standard story of scrappy outsiders versus evil corporations. But as I've been <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/9/9/9287719/utilities-monopoly"">arguing</a>, that's not quite right.</p> \n<p>Utilities aren't evil. They are doing exactly what they are designed to do. The problem is the design. Right now, utilities operate in a regulatory environment that puts them intrinsically at odds with some of the coolest, most promising stuff happening in energy today: rooftop solar, energy storage in electric vehicles and household batteries, smart home energy management tech like the Nest thermostat, and various new ways of aggregating and managing demand.</p> \n<p>These new technologies enable people to use less utility power. But utilities want people to use <em>more</em> utility power. So they fight the new technology. Until that fundamental conflict is resolved, utilities will be an impediment rather than a partner in the transition to a cleaner, smarter electricity grid.</p> \n<p>States are beginning to understand this, and several are taking steps to reform how their utilities work. None, however, are going at it with the speed and gusto of New York.</p> \n<p>Under the leadership of Gov. Andrew Cuomo, New York is undertaking an astonishingly comprehensive and ambitious <a href=""http://energyplan.ny.gov/"">effort</a> to remake its energy systems and reduce its carbon emissions. One part of that broader effort is a program known as <a href=""http://www.ny.gov/programs/reforming-energy-vision"">Reforming the Energy Vision</a> (REV), which charges the state's public service commission (PSC) with developing a new vision for utilities and implementing it in the next few years. The goal is to realign the incentives facing utilities so that they can profit from, and benefit from accelerating, the spread of new clean, distributed energy technologies.</p> \n<p>Reforming utilities is a perilous process, with intense politics and high stakes. Reliable service must be maintained throughout any transition — it's like rebuilding an airplane in flight.</p> \n<p>But if New York succeeds, REV could spark a wave of utility reform, with salutary effects on US carbon emissions (and the success of President Obama's Clean Power Plan). If it blows up or falls apart, it could scare other states away from restructuring, just like Enron did in the early 2000s. It's arguably the most important clean energy policy initiative in the country today.</p> \n<p><iframe width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/wr9-etn-m-k"" frameborder=""0""></iframe></p> \n<h3>New York is trying to fix two major problems with utilities</h3> \n<p>Let's briefly review why utilities aren't working today. (A longer version of this argument can be found in <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/9/9/9287719/utilities-monopoly"">this post</a>, on why utilities are broken, and <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/9/11/9306247/utilities-21st-century"">this one</a>, on how to fix them.)</p> \n<p>When utilities were first created, the entire area of electricity was seen as a ""natural monopoly,"" with a single utility given exclusive purview over a region's power generation, long-distance transmission, and local distribution. This made sense because of economies of scale (bigger power plants and longer transmission lines made for cheaper power) and high transaction costs (it was a pain in the ass to contract with third-party providers for electricity services).</p> \n<p>In the late 20th century, economies of scale began breaking down, mainly due to the introduction of small, efficient natural gas plants. In the 1990s and early 2000s, there was a wave of utility restructuring that split the power generation side off and handed it over to competitive markets. Deregulation made it to about 20 states (including New York) before the Enron fiasco froze it in place.</p> \n<p>Today, economies of scale are breaking down further, and thanks to internet and communications technology, transaction costs have declined as well. The natural monopoly keeps shrinking. Just as markets took over wholesale power generation, it is now possible for third parties to provide many of the <em>retail</em> services, to both customers and the distribution grid, that were once the exclusive purview of utilities.</p> \n<p>So one problem is determining the proper boundary of the natural monopoly, and how to open up the areas outside it to markets.</p> \n<p>The other big problem is how utilities make money.</p> \n<p>Right now, utility revenue comes from returns on capital investments in power lines, substations, and other infrastructure. Utilities make money by building stuff. Naturally, they like it when electricity demand rises — that justifies building more stuff. They don't like it when demand plateaus or falls. And they don't like anything that helps make more efficient use of existing infrastructure. Both those make it difficult to justify building more stuff.</p> \n<p>That is obviously a perverse set of incentives in an age when demand is becoming a controllable (""dispatchable"") resource and new sources and storage options are springing up at the distribution edge of the grid. The key to reform is aligning the interests of utilities with expanded use of DERs, customer choice, and social goals like reduced carbon emissions and energy intensity. Utilities somehow need to be able to make money off that stuff.</p> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""4125280""><img src=""https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4125280/nyrev-bridge.jpg""></div> \n<h3>Why utility reform and grid modernization are particularly important in New York</h3> \n<p>The US grid is old and utilities are anachronistic everywhere, but the need for reform is particularly pressing in New York, for several reasons.</p> \n<p>For one thing, the state's <a href=""http://energy.pace.edu/sites/default/files/publications/RPS%20Report.pdf"">renewable portfolio standard</a> (RPS) and its <a href=""http://www3.dps.ny.gov/W/PSCWeb.nsf/All/2197DAD6F78ECCB085257BA9005E71A6?OpenDocument"">energy efficiency portfolio standard</a> (EEPS) are both set to expire this year. The state needs new, better ways to encourage clean energy. That's one thing REV is intended to provide and why it is the subject of such intense interest from cleantech advocates and businesses in the state.</p> \n<p>For another, while overall electricity demand in New York has been fairly steady for the past decade, the ratio of peak demand to average demand has been rising. In other words, baseline electricity demand has fallen somewhat (thanks to energy efficiency and the broader shift to a more service-based economy), but <em>peak</em> demand has risen (thanks to everyone having flat-screen TVs and air conditioners and turning them on at the same time). The same thing is happening across New England; the Energy Information Agency discusses it <a href=""http://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.cfm?id=15051#tabs_SpotPriceSlider-2"">here</a>.</p> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""4125276""><img src=""https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4125276/nyiso-peak-to-average.png""></div> \n<p>This has two ill effects. First, it causes grid congestion during peak demand hours, which means utilities need to build more lines and substations, which means rates rise.</p> \n<p>Second, it causes electricity generation to be wildly overbuilt. There have to be enough power plants to provide the maximum power needed during peak hours. That means lots of power plants are sitting idle lots of the time, in off-peak hours. Some only run about 40 hours a year. The average New York power fleet ""capacity factor"" (time spent running) is around 55 percent. It is expensive and inefficient.</p> \n<p>Rather than build even more power plants and grid infrastructure, New York wants to attack the problem from the demand side. It wants to make its ""load profile"" smoother, less peaky. To do that, it needs to encourage energy efficiency, demand shifting, and distributed energy resources (DER)s — all of which, in the traditional regulatory model, reduce utility revenue.</p> \n<p>Thus, REV.</p> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""4125272""><img src=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4125272/REV-logo.png""></div> \n<h3>New York has a new vision for its utilities</h3> \n<p>To run REV, Cuomo made a few key hires. As his ""energy czar"" — chairman of energy and finance for New York, in charge of the state's entire energy portfolio — he chose Richard Kauffman, a cleantech investor, senior adviser to Steven Chu at the Department of Energy, and a big <a href=""http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/new-york-energy-czar-we-need-clean-energy-markets-not-programs"">believer in markets</a>.</p> \n<p>As chair of the PSC, he chose Audrey Zibelman, who's been consulting and testifying on electricity industry issues for 30 years. Notably, she was a driving force behind electricity restructuring in 1990s.</p> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""4125290"">\n<img src=""https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4125290/Audrey%20Zibelman.jpg""> \n<div class=""caption""> \n<p>Audrey Zibelman.</p> \n</div> \n</div> \n<p>Kauffman and Zibelman came in with a clear understanding of the problems facing utilities. Their solution, in a nutshell, is to complete the work of restructuring. They want to create markets where third parties can compete to provide energy products and services on the retail side, things like energy storage, demand response, and distributed generation. They want the prices of those products and services to be set by the market, based on the real-time needs of the grid rather than by regulatory fiat.</p> \n<p>And they want utilities — alongside their continuing core functions of resource planning, maintaining the grid, and providing reliable service — to help establish these markets and get them running smoothly.</p> \n<p>It's a grand <a href=""https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-cuomo-announces-reforms-energy-utility-industry"">vision</a>, but devilishly complex in practice, with all sorts of difficult questions to answer along the way. I won't get into nearly all of them, but it's worth looking at two key questions in a little more detail.</p> \n<h3>Problem No. 1: How far should a utility's monopoly extend?</h3> \n<p>Utility restructuring in the 1990s and early 2000s sprang from a recognition that power generation was no longer a natural monopoly. It could be served by competitive markets.</p> \n<p>So states that restructured had to create — or, what is apparently the new term of art, ""animate"" — wholesale power generation markets.</p> \n<p>The first thing policymakers did is take any ownership of power generation away from regulated distribution utilities, recognizing the obvious fact that they couldn't be fair, impartial purchasers of power if they were also in the business of generating it. Power generation could only be owned by unregulated subsidiaries.</p> \n<p>The long-distance transmission system would be administered, and wholesale markets for power run, by independent, nonprofit organizations called independent system operators (ISOs).*</p> \n<p>The key feature of this arrangement is that regulated utilities no longer have any stake in wholesale power markets or any ability to influence them. They don't own power generation and they don't oversee the market. They only care about purchasing reliable, low-cost electricity for their customers. (In theory.)</p> \n<p>Responsibility for administering wholesale power markets was given to ISOs because their only incentive is to run the markets well. Order 888 from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), which established utility restructuring, said that the core purpose of ISOs was to ""operate the transmission systems of public utilities in a manner that is independent of any business interest in sales or purchases of electric power by those utilities.""</p> \n<p>Today, for a whole variety of reasons, the retail side of electricity is no longer a natural monopoly either. Retail customers (businesses and homes) increasingly want choices about where their power comes from, its quality and reliability, and how it's stored or managed. Where there was once a one-way flow of power from big power plants into passive buildings, the grid is evolving into a multidirectional network, with every node a participant, generating power, storing it, and selling it. There's a whole array of technologies and services blooming along the edge of the grid, where the grid meets the customer power meter, and ""behind the meter,"" inside homes and buildings. All those products and services are best provided by competitive markets.</p> \n<p>The boundary of the natural monopoly has moved inward again. What remains of it is grid operations and reliability planning — that is, running the distribution grid itself. That's the only function that is still properly the purview of a publicly accountable, regulated utility.</p> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""4125294""><img src=""https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4125294/monopoly-electric-company.jpg""></div> \n<p>So New York faces a question not unlike the one it faced some 20 years ago: how to animate new electricity markets, draw in third-party providers, and properly price new electricity products and services.</p> \n<p>There are two broad options. If New York were to follow the same model used in wholesale restructuring, it could require regulated utilities to divest of all ownership or participation in retail markets and establish independent organizations — independent distribution system operators (IDSOs) — to oversee those markets. That is just the model advocated by many grid reformers, most notably <a href=""http://www.utilitydive.com/news/jon-wellinghoff-utilities-should-not-operate-the-distribution-grid/298286/"">former FERC Chair Jon Wellinghoff</a>.</p> \n<p>But there's a second possible way to restructure. Regulated New York utilities believe <em>they</em> should be given the market-administering role played by the ISOs in wholesale markets.</p> \n<p>That would give utilities a hybrid role. They would be in charge of grid operations and reliability planning, per their natural monopoly. And they would also be in charge of animating and managing retail electricity markets, per the ISO function. In this hybrid model, utilities would be known as distributed service providers (DSPs).</p> \n<p>The argument between the IDSO model and the DSP model is quite interesting, more so than the thicket of acronyms might indicate. But the wonky details are probably better saved for another post.</p> \n<p>Suffice to say, the PSC found the utilities persuasive. In its <a href=""http://documents.dps.ny.gov/public/Common/ViewDoc.aspx?DocRefId=%7b0B599D87-445B-4197-9815-24C27623A6A0%7d"">Track One Order</a> (which establishes the basic framework of reform; Track Two, which will pin down many details, is in process) it settled on the <a href=""http://www.utilitydive.com/news/in-new-york-utility-of-the-future-will-be-air-traffic-controller/373342/"">DSP model</a>, under which the utility would plan and ensure reliability, run the grid, <em>and</em> administer the market.</p> \n<p>The PSC did emphasize that DSP ownership of assets or participation in retail markets would be ""the exception rather than the rule."" A DSP can own DERs when it has tried to procure them but the market has not produced affordable choices. It can own some energy storage to improve grid functioning. And it can own DERs when they will benefit low-income residents who can't afford them, or for <a href=""http://www.utilitydive.com/news/new-york-funds-5-clean-energy-projects-under-rev-for-175m/406327/?utm_source=Sailthru&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=Issue:%202015-09-28%20Utility%20Dive%20Newsletter&amp;utm_term=Utility%20Dive"">demonstration projects</a>.</p> \n<p><iframe width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/DNMcKdNLth8"" frameborder=""0""></iframe></p> \n<p>But for the most part, DSPs are not meant to participate in the markets they create. They will establish and enforce rules, provide reliable, open-access, real-time data, source (through procurement or rate design) services needed by the grid, coordinate and schedule resources, ensure cybersecurity, and possibly coordinate with wholesale markets via the New York ISO.  (Much, much more can be found on all these responsibilities in REV's Market Design Platform Technology <a href=""https://newyorkrevworkinggroups.com/"">working group report</a>.)</p> \n<p>A great deal remains to be worked out. The details will become clearer when the Track Two Order is finalized (comments on the <a href=""https://www.energymarketers.com/Documents/NY_REV_Track_2_paper.pdf"">straw proposal</a> are due today [<b>UPDATE:</b> the comment deadline has been pushed back; comments on track two are now <a href=""http://documents.dps.ny.gov/public/MatterManagement/CaseMaster.aspx?MatterCaseNo=14-M-0101&amp;submit=Search+by+Case+Number"" target=""_blank"">due on the 26th</a>]). What's clear is that lots and lots of this is uncharted territory.</p> \n<p>Originally, state utilities were expected to come up with distributed system implementation plans (DSIPs), which would chart their transition to this new model, by the end of 2015. That always seemed crazy to me; the deadline has now been moved to the end of June 2016.</p> \n<h3>Problem No. 2: How will utilities make money?</h3> \n<p>Right now, utilities make money exclusively through returns on capital investments. That creates an obvious incentive to seek more capital investments. But today's grids and resources are capable of operating much more efficiently than they do now. Peaky loads can be met with demand management, efficiency, and DERs rather than new infrastructure.</p> \n<p>To achieve that, however, utilities need to shift resources from capex (capital expenditures) to opex (operating expenditures). They need to shift from <em>building</em> to more intelligently <em>managing</em>, from machines to services.</p> \n<p>Obviously that's hard to do if you only make revenue on capex!</p> \n<p>So the PSC is trying to create new revenue streams for utilities, via <a href=""http://www.utilitydive.com/news/can-performance-based-ratemaking-save-utilities/252683/"">performance-based regulation</a>, or, in New York's specific argot, earnings impact mechanisms (EIMs).</p> \n<p>The idea is that the utility will still be on the hook for its traditional responsibilities, like reliability. But there will also be performance-based incentives available for the achievement of other goals, like peak reduction. If the utility exceeds its performance goals, it can earn extra revenue as a reward.</p> \n<p>So say a particular area of the grid is congested and suffering from high peaks. The utility faces a decision: Does it build a new substation, or does it procure demand-shifting services from a third party? Under the old model, building the substation was the only way it could make money. But if demand-shifting services help the utility meet its peak-reduction goal/EIM, under the new model it could receive a bonus for that. That gives the utility incentive to find new ways (other than building infrastructure) to reliably meet peak demand.</p> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""4125300"">\n<img src=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4125300/new-york-grid.jpg""> \n<div class=""caption""> \n<p>New York's hungry grid.</p> \n</div> \n</div> \n<p>EIMs are conceived of as a transitional measure. Over time, as retail markets mature, regulators plan to phase them out. The idea is that the utility eventually won't need them, as it will have a variety of market-based earnings (MBEs) available, services it can make money providing to market participants.</p> \n<p>This scheme raises some of the same objections from reformers as the DSP model, namely: If the services provided by the utility as MBEs can truly only be provided by regulated utilities, then they ought to be regulated services, with regulated prices, not market prices. And if they can be provided by third parties, then regulated utilities have no business providing them. There's a real danger of utilities shaping markets to favor the services that utilities provide.</p> \n<p>So far, the EIMs and MBEs envisioned by the PSC are mostly related to animating markets, not competing in them. But they are not very clearly defined in the Track Two straw proposal. Reformers will be watching closely as the EIM/MBE model is filled in with details.</p> \n<h3>New York is walking a high wire, and everyone is watching</h3> \n<p>Across the country, lawmakers, regulators, utility executives, and grid geeks are closely tracking the progress of NY REV. It is not the only effort at utility reform underway, but it is the biggest and in many ways the <em>cleanest</em>.</p> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""4125304"">\n<img src=""https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4125304/andrew-cuomo.jpg""> \n<div class=""caption""> \n<p>New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, squinting at the future of utilities.</p> \n</div> \n</div> \n<p>To a remarkable extent, the process thus far has been free of the usual poisonous politics that surround utilities in other states. Cuomo's entire energy plan falls under his executive powers, so there's been no fractious fight with the legislature. Experienced wonks are running the relevant agencies. Utilities have seen which way the wind is blowing and are on board. A broad array of stakeholders has been involved from the very beginning (shout out here to the clean energy trade group <a href=""http://blog.aee.net/major-steps-toward-a-21st-century-electricity-system-in-new-york-california"">Advanced Energy Economy</a>, which has deftly coordinated many of these stakeholder meetings).</p> \n<p>It would be naive to think the process is free of politics or the influence of incumbents. And it is sure to become more disputatious as it moves from generalities to specifics.</p> \n<p>But this is about as close to clean-sheet-of-paper reform as utilities have seen in any US state. If it works, the effects could be seismic. As customers become more directly involved in energy, they will also become <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/9/17/9343125/climate-policy-sequencing"">constituents for further reform</a>. As New York utilities profit from grid-edge innovation, utilities in other states will see that the much-feared ""death spiral"" is not inevitable and that a prosperous future is possible. And as new markets, services, and jobs are created, other state lawmakers will see that reducing carbon emissions (and meeting EPA standards) can be an economic stimulus.</p> \n<p>Or REV could all fail, in a thousand different ways, any of which could serve to dampen reform efforts elsewhere in the country. Utility reformers have been talking about opening retail electricity up to markets and innovation for a long, long time. Now, for good or ill, they are seeing their dreams put into action.</p> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""4125310"">\n<img src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4125310/clean-coalition-microgrid.jpg""> \n<div class=""caption""> \n<p>A microgrid, as rendered by someone without the money to hire a professional artist.</p> \n</div> \n</div> \n<h3>Further reading:</h3> \n<p>If you just can't get enough of REV and want to read more, here are some suggestions:</p> \n<ul> \n<li>No one is covering utilities, including NY REV, better than <a href=""http://www.utilitydive.com/"">Utility Dive</a>, which has risen to the top of my must-read list over the last year.

You know about net neutrality. Meet grid neutrality.,http://www.vox.com/2015/10/9/9483803/grid-neutrality,"Keeping the power grid open to all, just like the internet.","<p>The electricity grid is in the beginning stages of a fateful evolution.</p> \n<p>For a century or so, the model for the grid has been ""hub and spoke"" — electricity has been generated in large central power plants and spilled through wires into customer buildings. It works like water flowing downhill through canals and channels into basins; the basins are passive recipients, and the water only flows one way.</p> \n<p>In the grid of the future, electricity will behave less like water and more like information<em>. </em>Everyone will consume it, produce it, store it, and share it. The customers at the ends of the wires will become active participants — producer/consumers, or ""prosumers,"" in the awful jargon — and hub-and-spoke will give way to a multidirectional <em>network</em>.</p> \n<p>In short, the grid will become less like a public water system and more like the internet, a networked platform upon which all sorts of innovations and markets can grow.</p> \n<p>The internet is blessed with a community of thinkers, advocates, and activists who recognize that the full benefits of the web will only be unlocked if it is open to everyone, with no barriers to full, equal access. That's what the net neutrality movement is about.</p> \n<p>As the power grid evolves into a network, it needs the same protections, for many of the same reasons. It needs a grid neutrality movement.</p> \n<p>Nerds to the rescue!</p> \n<h3>The five core tenets of grid neutrality</h3> \n<p>In this month's issue of Public Utilities Fortnightly, a group of electricity analysts — Jenny Hu, an analyst at Clean Power Finance, Shayle Kann, head of GTM Research, James Tong, VP for strategy and government affairs at Clean Power Finance, and Jon Wellinghoff, lawyer for Stoel Rives and former chair of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission — have <a href=""http://www.fortnightly.com/fortnightly/2015/10/grid-neutrality?authkey=ed35b3b85bbf07d45ed851553614b1fd3b4d54c8899f72d8b0a569452900cdec"" target=""_blank"">issued a call for grid neutrality</a>, offering five broad tenets they say should guide coming efforts at grid reform.</p> \n<p>Here are the tenets:</p> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""4137838""><img src=""https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4137838/puf-grid-neutrality-tenets.png""></div> \n<p>Here they are as text, with a little explanation (quoted from the graphic above):</p> \n<ol> \n<li> <strong>The consumer empowerment principle:</strong> Empower the consumer while maintaining universal access to safe, reliable electricity at reasonable cost. (Maximize consumers’ ability to achieve their individual energy needs and the needs of the grid without compromising the universal right of all consumers to access a safe, reliable energy service at reasonable cost.)</li> \n<li> <strong>The commons principle:</strong> Demarcate and protect the ""commons."" (Establish clear operational and jurisdictional boundaries for public and private interests.)</li> \n<li> <strong>The risk/reward principle:</strong> Align risks and rewards across the industry. (Allocate financial risks to stakeholders who are most willing and able to assume them. Safeguard the public interest by containing the risks undertaken by private parties to those participants.)</li> \n<li> <strong>The transparency principle:</strong> Create a transparent, level playing field. (Promote and protect open standards, data access, and transparency to encourage sustainable innovation on the grid. Prevent any single party — public or private — from abusing its influence.)</li> \n<li> <strong>The open access principle:</strong> Foster open access to the grid. (Allow all parties who meet system-wide standards the opportunity to add value to the grid. Apply all standards evenly and prevent any non-merit-based discrimination.)</li> \n</ol> \n<h3>Using the five tenets to analyze a recent utility case</h3> \n<p>These principles are a bit abstract, so to show how they work in action, the authors use them to analyze a recent bit of hot utility action in New York.</p> \n<p>As you recall, New York is in the midst of a hugely ambitious rethink of its energy systems, including its power utilities (I wrote posts about it: <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/10/5/9453131/new-york-utilities-rev"">one</a>, <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/10/7/9465967/new-york-electricity-markets"">two</a>), but the authors hone in on a particular episode, an <a href=""http://www.eenews.net/stories/1060008037"" target=""_blank"">early harbinger</a> of those reforms.</p> \n<p>It begins with New York utility Con Edison:</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>Con Edison faced a situation common to many utilities. Electricity demand growth in Brooklyn and Queens had increased significantly, threatening by the year 2018 to overload the capabilities of feeders serving two substations (Brownsville 1 &amp; 2) by 69 MW. Historically, utilities in Con Edison’s position met similar grid needs by constructing new substations, feeders and switching stations, which in this case would result in an aggregate cost of over $1 billion. But this time, in July 2014, Con Edison solicited offers to fill this need not only in the traditional way, but also by non-traditional resources.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>The plot thickens!</p> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""4140444"">\n<img src=""https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4140444/new-york-power-lines.jpg""> \n<div class=""caption""> \n<p>Expensive.</p> \n</div> \n</div> \n<p>So Con Edison needed 69 MW of new grid capacity to handle the rising load. What it proposed was novel: It would get 17 MW of that capacity the traditional way, by investing in grid infrastructure, but it would get the other 52 MW by soliciting help from third-party suppliers of distributed energy resources (DERs). It would put out a request for proposals (RFP) saying, in effect, ""We have a problem; help us solve it.""</p> \n<p>Most of the responses to the RFP came in the form of ""demand management."" The goal of demand management is to make demand a controllable (""dispatchable"") resource. Each customer is paid a small amount to allow his demand to be slightly dialed back during peak hours; those customers are aggregated together (by a third-party ""demand response aggregator"") until the cumulative demand is enough to make a difference to grid congestion.</p> \n<p>Thus was born the <a href=""https://enerknol.com/ny-psc-approves-con-edison-bqdm-program/"" target=""_blank"">Brooklyn/Queens Demand Management (BQDM) program</a>.</p> \n<p>The total cost of ConEd's proposal was $200 million, which is ... considerably less than a billion. The New York Public Service Commission (PSC) approved it.</p> \n<p>So let's look at how this case stacks up to the five tenets of grid neutrality.</p> \n<p><strong>1) Empowering customers:</strong> By making some traditional infrastructure investments just in case, ConEd fulfilled its responsibility to assure reliable service. But by filling most of the need with DERs, it drew in private companies and empowered customers to lower grid-wide costs.</p> \n<p>That's the dual mandate: reliable service and empowering customers.</p> \n<p><strong>2) Demarcating the commons:</strong> The idea here is to clearly separate monopoly activities from market activities, and to keep the utility out of the latter. So in this case, ConEd made some traditional grid investments and will own the infrastructure; those investments will be ""rate based,"" i.e., charged to customers through rates.</p> \n<p>But the nontraditional portion of the proposal, the demand-management products and services, will be owned by third parties. ConEd will procure it, but not own any of it, so as not to wield undue influence on market competition.</p> \n<p>Thus: regulated monopoly on one side, market on the other.</p> \n<p><strong>3) Risk and reward:</strong> ConEd made money on the deal in two ways. It got the traditional rate-based returns on its traditional grid investments. And, through ""performance-based regulation,"" it got a bonus for encouraging DERs. But the PSC turned down ConEd's request to also capture 50 percent of the savings from the nontraditional, customer-side programs. The PSC doesn't want ConEd to have any stake in what products and services the market offers up. And it wants market participants to capture the full market value. So all the savings from the BQDM program went straight to customers.</p> \n<p>The utility makes noncompetitive investments, for rate-based returns; market participants make competitive investments, for market-based returns; never the twain shall meet. Or at least never the twain <em>should</em> meet.</p> \n<p><strong>4) Transparency:</strong> The PSC insisted that everything be upfront. A third party oversaw the issuance of the RFP and reported the results to the PSC. The RFP was clear about grid needs and what kind of DERs could meet them. ConEd will issue public reports on the new programs, quarterly. Everyone had all the information at every stage.</p> \n<p>The more information is clear and shared, the more neutral the grid is for prospective market participants.</p> \n<p><strong>5) Open access:</strong> The cool thing about <a href=""http://www.coned.com/energyefficiency/competitive_solutions_opportunities.asp"">ConEd's RFP</a> is that it didn't specify <em>how</em> the grid need was to be met. It was neutral among technologies and solutions. That meant that any company with an idea for how to shift or reduce demand could jump in. And sure enough, it elicited 78 responses, ranging from demand management to energy efficiency to distributed generation.</p> \n<p>That's what open access means: a level playing field for any participant with a product or service that meets grid needs.</p> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""4140496"">\n<img src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4140496/net-neutrality-protest.jpg""> \n<div class=""caption""> \n<p>Can some of you Fawkes-ers protest for the open grid?</p> \n</div> \n</div> \n<h3>Using grid neutrality as a guide for future utility reform</h3> \n<p>So the ConEd deal serves as a sterling example of the five tenets of grid neutrality in action. It empowers customers, keeps monopoly activities and returns separate from market activities and returns, makes all relevant information public, and provides a neutral platform that can be accessed by anyone with a grid solution. Good show, New York.</p> \n<p>However, as the authors stress, these principles are quite general; they can be adapted as a guide to a whole variety of utility proceedings or reforms.</p> \n<p>That's a good thing, because utility reform is only going to gain steam. A lot of states are going to be grappling with a lot of difficult questions soon; it will be nice to have a clear, simple set of principles they can consult for guidance.</p> \n<p>The grid is becoming a network. Ideally, it will become an open-access platform that enables distributed innovation. But there's every bit as much chance it could become a balkanized, tiered-access, incumbent-dominated, inefficient mess (even more so than it is today, that is).</p> \n<p>Vested interests and path dependency lurk around every corner. Here's hoping a citizen-driven grid neutrality movement arises, as organized and committed as the one now defending the internet, to make sure the grid of the future delivers on its potential.</p>",Politics

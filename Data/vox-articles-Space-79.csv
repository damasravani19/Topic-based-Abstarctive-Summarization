How space trash could start a nuclear war,http://www.vox.com/2014/4/21/5625246/space-war-china-north-korea-iran,"Like Star Wars, but for real.","<p>Panic in the skies! ""The threats to U.S. space assets are significant and growing,"" according to a new report from the Council on Foreign Relations, which warns that there's a real chance of breaching conflict's final frontier.</p> \n<p>This isn't idle fearmongering. The report makes a not-crazy case that efforts by China and other powers to limit America's total military dominance of space could accidentally destroy an American satellite, inadvertently convincing the US that war was coming and prompting retaliation on Earth. <span>Its author, Micah Zenko, has </span><a style=""background-color: #ffffff; line-height: 1.5;"" href=""http://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/the-anti-warrior/"">made a name</a><span> for himself in report-after-report downplaying the threat to the United States from China, terrorists, and, really, </span><a style=""background-color: #ffffff; line-height: 1.5;"" href=""http://blogs.cfr.org/zenko/2012/02/23/clear-and-present-safety-the-united-states-is-more-secure-than-washington-thinks/"">most things</a><span>.

Of all the money spent on space by all countries combined, America <a href=""http://www.cfr.org/space/dangerous-space-incidents/p32790?sp_mid=45655631&amp;sp_rid=emFjay5iZWF1Y2hhbXBAZ21haWwuY29tS0"">spends</a> 75 percent. It also owns 43 percent of all satellites. It uses that huge satellite network for, among other things, all sorts of military spying and coordination purposes. At one point, the Bush Administration <a href=""http://www.armscontrol.org/act/2004_11/Krepon"">mused openly</a> about putting actual weapons pointed at Earth in space.</p> \n<p>Countries who might hypothetically fight a war with the United States hate that space dominance, which gives the US a real strategic edge. Some have <a href=""http://www.stimson.org/images/uploads/Anti-satellite_Weapons.pdf"">developed</a> anti-satellite (ASAT) weapons, usually missiles that shoot into space. Zenko thinks ASAT weapons are really dangerous, particularly those owned by China, North Korea, and Iran. The threat comes from both deliberate use and the risk of a misunderstanding that could spiral out of control.</p> \n<p>The ""greatest threat to international space security,"" in Zenko's view, is a Chinese accident. China is <a href=""http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2014/4/16/china-s-presidentxiurgesgreatermilitaryuseofspace.html"">seriously investing</a> in ASAT weaponry, which it has tested by blowing up old satellites in low earth orbit, one of the places place where satellites live. <span>These explosions create debris, which can travel tens of thousands of miles per hour and shred up other satellites and spacecraft. </span></p> \n<p><span>If debris from a Chinese test destroys a US military satellite</span><span>, the US could mistake it as a preemptive strike against its space capabilities &mdash; some of which are </span><a href=""http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/military/nuclear-false-alarms.html"">designed</a><span> to detect nuclear missile launches. </span><span>If the US thinks China </span><span>is trying to take out its ability to detect a nuclear launch, things could get very bad, very quickly.</span></p> \n<p><img src=""http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/assets/4316261/missile_nasa.png"" class=""photo"" alt=""Missile_nasa""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">NASA</p> \n<p>Accidents aren't the only concern. Zenko also worries about intentional space attacks, either during peacetime or a crisis. Here, Iran and North Korea are probably bigger threats, though their ASAT capabilities are far from proven.</p> \n<p>North Korea has a pattern of crazy military moves designed to extort concessions from South Korea and the West; it could extend that behavior to space. Iran, according to Zenko, ""already views space as a legitimate arena in which to contest US military power."" He worries that Iran might fire missiles into space ""during a major crisis, especially if it believes war is imminent &mdash; an assessment that could have self-fulfilling consequences.""</p> \n<p>But even if none of these scenarios for war are likely, preparing and testing for space war is intrinsically dangerous. Space debris don't discriminate between military and non-military satellites; the more ASAT testing there is, the more hazardous space travel becomes for everyone. As satellites become increasingly important to the economy and scientific research, even preparation for space war becomes deadly.</p> \n<p><img src=""http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/assets/4316333/Screen_Shot_2014-04-17_at_4.30.40_PM.png"" class=""photo"" alt=""Screen_shot_2014-04-17_at_4""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Pictured: not actual space combat. Howard Longden/Flickr CC</p> \n<p><span>So what is to be done? Zenko has a 12-point list of recommendations, including investing in debris cleanup capabilities and a US declaration unilaterally forswearing ASAT weapons. These aren't pipe dreams: the US and Soviet Union negotiated the Outer Space Treaty, which </span><a href=""http://www.state.gov/t/isn/5181.htm"" style=""background-color: #ffffff; line-height: 1.5;"">banned</a><span> ""orbital weapons of mass destruction,"" in 1967.</span></p> \n<p>If the US and Soviet Union could do that at the height of the Cold War, the prospects for space arms control are real. Until then, though, it's worth lifting up our eyes and looking towards the heavens.</p>",Space

Voyager 2 is still active as well — it'll also enter interstellar space in a few years, after taking a slightly longer path than Voyager 1. Together, they're the two farthest human-made objects from Earth in existence.</p> \n<h3>So has Voyager 1 entered interstellar space?</h3> \n<p>Yes, it finally has. But for a few reasons, this has been an area of ongoing dispute among scientists — and in reality, it's more of an arbitrary distinction than anything else.</p> \n<p><img alt=""Voyager_1_entering_heliosheath_region"" class=""photo"" src=""http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/assets/4731204/Voyager_1_entering_heliosheath_region.jpg""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">(<a href=""http://www.nasa.gov/vision/universe/solarsystem/voyager_agu.html"" target=""_blank"">NASA/Walt Feimer</a>)</p> \n<p>The main reason is that the boundary between the heliosphere (the region filled with the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_wind"" target=""_blank"">solar wind</a>, a stream of plasma shot out by the sun) and interstellar space (the vast region filled with a disperse mix of matter called the <a style=""line-height: 1.5;"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstellar_medium"" target=""_blank"">interstellar medium</a>) is much less neat than it seems in the graphic above.</p> \n<p><q class=""right"" aria-hidden=""true"">the boundary is much less neat than it seems in the graphic above</q></p> \n<p><span>The solar wind flows outward at high speeds until it begins interacting with the interstellar medium at what scientists call </span><span>the termination shock, then slows abruptly. These two materials interact throughout a region called the heliosheath. Then, at the heliopause, the pressure of the interstellar medium exceeds that of the solar wind, pushing back on it and effectively marking the outer edge of the heliosphere, and the beginning of interstellar space.</span></p> \n<p>But the location of this boundary can move over time, based on the strength of the solar wind and other factors. Instead of thinking of it like the boundary between two states, a better analogy is the spot where the Mississippi River becomes the Gulf of Mexico. They're two distinctly different things, filled with different substances, but the border between them is blurry, and can move around over time.</p> \n<p>This is part of the reason why scientists have gone back and forth on the exact status of Voyager 1 for the past couple of years. But earlier this week, using data collected by Voyager on the density of plasma surrounding it, they firmly concluded that it's entered the interstellar medium. Most now agree that it formally crossed the boundary <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/voyager/voyager20130912.html"">back in August 2012</a>.</p> \n<h3>So has Voyager 1 left the solar system?</h3> \n<p>No. This is a fine, semantic distinction, but it's worth clarifying.</p> \n<p><span>The boundary of interstellar space is defined by the region dominated by the interstellar medium, instead of the solar wind. But </span><span>the solar system includes all sorts of extremely far-flung comets and other objects that are well outside the heliosphere.</span></p> \n<p>We know very little about these comets, which may make up a hypothetical region called the <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oort_cloud"" style=""line-height: 1.5; background-color: #ffffff;"">Oort Cloud</a> (its existence is only inferred, and based on some comets that have very long orbits that would take them well outside the heliopause).</p> \n<p><img src=""http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/assets/4731284/PIA17046_-_Voyager_1_Goes_Interstellar.jpg"" class=""photo"" alt=""Pia17046_-_voyager_1_goes_interstellar""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">(<a href=""http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA17046"" target=""_blank"">NASA/JPL-Caltech</a>)</p> \n<p><span>The Oort Cloud is probably extremely far away.

For this reason, the researchers planted a few nitrogen-fixing crops (which harbor bacteria on their roots that convert nitrogen in the air to the kind that's available to plants), in addition to crops like t<span>omatoes, wheat, cress, and carrot plants and a number of plants that grow wildly in the Netherlands, like </span><a style=""line-height: 1.5; background-color: #ffffff;"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedum"" target=""_blank"">stonecrop</a>.</p> \n<p>Apart from the Mars simulant, the researchers planted all these<span> in a </span><a style=""line-height: 1.5; background-color: #ffffff;"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_regolith_simulant"" target=""_blank"">simulated lunar soil</a><span> and the low-nutrient Earth soil as well.

This is important, because though the crops could live 50 days solely on the scant amounts of nitrogen available in the soil, it's very unlikely they'd be able to produce meaningful amounts of food that way. But if Martian colonizers also brought along some nitrogen-fixers, the two could potentially be combined to make a viable food system.</p> \n<p style=""font-family: 'Alright Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 22.5px;"">Interestingly, all of the crops did better in the Martian soil simulant than the nutrient-poor Rhine soil used as a control.</p> \n<h3>Why farming on Mars might still be impossible</h3> \n<p>The results of this study are certainly exciting. But there are a huge number of questions that remain before Martian agriculture would possibly be a viable option.</p> \n<p>The first question to ask is how closely the soil simulant resembles the actual soil on Mars. The researchers note that it might contain contaminants, present when it was harvested in Hawaii, that let plants to grow more successfully in it. And recent experiments carried out by Curiosity have indicated that toxic chemicals called perchlorates — not present in the simulant — <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.sciencemag.org/content/340/6129/138.2.full"">may be abundant in Martian soil</a>.</p> \n<p><q class=""right"" aria-hidden=""true"">how closely does the soil simulant resemble the actual soil on mars?</q></p> \n<p>Additionally, even if this experiment showed that plants might be able to sprout and produce a few leaves in Martian soil, that's hugely different from producing enough food to substantially contribute to the diet of colonizers. Even if nitrogen-fixing plants were brought along to help with the growth, they'd rely on the activity of specific bacteria that may not do well in the Martian environment. And the effect of <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/mars-exploration/what-is-mars-like"" style=""line-height: 1.5;"">Mars' reduced gravity</a> on plant growth is still unknown.</p> \n<p>On top of all this, there are a bunch of logistical questions that remain. Could we really build functional greenhouses on Mars? How would we keep them warm? Could we melt enough ice to produce enough liquid water?</p> \n<p>At this point, you get into bigger issues, like the fact that we don't yet have rockets big enough to <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/mars-exploration/how-hard-would-it-be-to-get-humans-to-mars"">send a crewed craft to Mars</a>, or the technology necessary to land one on it.

Historically, the Aral Sea was fed by both the Syr Darya and the Amu Darya rivers flowing down from the mountains. But in the 1960s, the Soviet Union <a href=""http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg12416910.800-soviet-cotton-threatens-a-regions-sea--and-its-children.html"">diverted both rivers</a> — through a network of dams and canals — for use in cotton fields and other agriculture.</p> \n<p><q class=""right"" aria-hidden=""true"">'Although irrigation made the desert bloom, it devastated the Aral Sea'</q></p> \n<p>Here's NASA: ""Although irrigation made the desert bloom, it devastated the Aral Sea. As the lake dried up, fisheries and the communities that depended on them collapsed. The increasingly salty water became polluted with fertilizer and pesticides. Blowing, salty dust from the exposed lakebed became a public health hazard and degraded the soil. Croplands had to be flushed with larger and larger volumes of river water.""</p> \n<p>By the 2000s, the Aral Sea was roughly 10 percent of its original size. The area's once-vital fishing industry had been completely eradicated, leaving <a href=""http://www.fao.org/ag/magazine/9809/spot2.htm"">entire communities unemployed</a>. The disappearance of the sea <a href=""http://www.columbia.edu/~tmt2120/environmental%20impacts.htm"">has also affected the local climate</a> — summers have been getting hotter, and winters have been getting colder.</p> \n<p>And now the lake <i>keeps</i> shrinking during dry years. In 2014, a paucity of snow in the mountains combined with continued high levels of water withdrawals for irrigation helped dry out the eastern basin for the first time in possibly 600 years, <a href=""http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/IOTD/view.php?id=84437&amp;src=twitter-iotd"">explained</a> Philip Micklin, a geographer emeritus from Western Michigan University.</p> \n<p>Of course, the lake tends to ebb and grow with wet and dry seasons. As you can see in <a href=""http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/WorldOfChange/aral_sea.php"">NASA's photos</a>, the eastern side of the lake had nearly gone dry in 2009 but then returned in 2010. Meanwhile, <a href=""http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1440-1770.2010.00437.x/abstract"">there are some projects</a> to try to save the deeper western basin of the Aral Sea from vanishing entirely.

But it also makes an important point about the tactics of the protesters — specifically, one thing they're doing right that a lot of other demonstrators do wrong.</p> \n<p><a style=""line-height: 1.5;"" href=""https://twitter.com/tmalmay87"">Tom Malmay</a>, who runs a <a href=""https://malmayassociates-public.sharepoint.com/about-us"">disaster planning group in Lousiana</a>, used software from <a href=""http://blog.geofeedia.com/featured-instagram-map-social-media-content-from-the-democracy-protests-in-hong-kong"">Geofeedia</a> to map and timestamp Instagrams from the Hong Kong protests. The result is pretty amazing: a map that shows you when and where the photo was taken. If you scroll photos by time using the tool at the bottom, you basically get a historical on-the-ground tour through the protests:</p> \n<p><iframe frameborder=""0"" height=""600px"" width=""100%"" src=""http://maps.geofeedia.com/prev.php?guid=MzNjOWM5NzNkZmVlYjg1Nzc2NTA1OTQxZmI1YzI4NzFjMjE1MDk4NQ=="" id=""GeofeediaMapsEmbed""></iframe></p> \n<p>This is obviously a really cool map. And s<span>crolling through the photos really is powerful. You get a great sense of the protest's enormous scope, as well as a deeply human portrait of the protesters themselves.</span></p> \n<p>But there's something else interesting here. It has to do with the patterns of where the Instagram photos pop up.</p> \n<p><span>You'll notice that the Instagrams aren't concentrated in one square, like the Cairo demonstrations in Tahrir Square or Occupy Wall Street in Zucotti park. They seem to cluster in the north of Hong Kong Island, in the financial district, and to a lesser degree across Victoria Harbor in the south tip of the mainland, but aren't confined to a particular public space.</span></p> \n<p>That's likely to make the protests more effective. ""I do sometimes get concerned with campaigns that think they have to stay in a square in occupation,"" Erica Chenoweth, a professor at the University of Denver who studies non-violent resistance, told me in an earlier interview. <span>""I think that becomes very vulnerable to really nasty crackdowns, lethal kinds, and mass killings.""</span></p> \n<p><iframe style=""line-height: 1.5;"" allowtransparency=""true"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""0"" height=""692"" width=""612"" src=""http://instagram.com/p/tn7NKct3M0/embed/""></iframe></p> \n<p>In other words, any one instance of violent repression — say, being forced out of a key square — doesn't necessarily crush the movement. There's not a lot invested in holding that one space, so it's not a huge blow if they have to retreat. Moreover, if the protesters aren't investing heavily in holding onto one space, they're able to focus on other actions, like boycotts and strikes. According to <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/10/2/6883313/hong-kong-protest-win"">Chenoweth</a>, the most successful non-violent resistance movements generally diversify their tactics in this fashion.</p> \n<p>So this map shows something that's becoming increasingly clear: the Hong Kong democracy movement <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/10/2/6883313/hong-kong-protest-win"">really knows what it's doing</a>.</p>",Space

(During partial or penumbral eclipses, which are more common, only the earlier, less-cool stages of the eclipse occur — there is no total blockage of the moon, and no eerie red glow.) But the next eclipse won't be visible from most of the US, so if you live in America and miss this one, your next chance will be in September 2015.</span></p> \n<p>As it happens, the 21st century as a whole <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_21st-century_lunar_eclipses"" target=""_blank"">is going to feature</a> eight tetrads <span>(that's 32 eclipses), an unusually high number. </span><span>Between 1600 and 1900, for comparison, there were zero tetrads.

Some of the light reflected off nitrogen and oxygen molecules, and was scattered out into space.</p> \n<p>The light most likely to be filtered out was light with shorter wavelengths — blues and greens — leaving mostly red light, with the longest wavelength, to make it through.

There's a partial solar eclipse Thursday afternoon. Here's how to see it,http://www.vox.com/2014/10/22/7039309/partial-eclipse-solar,Good news: it'll be viewable from pretty much anywhere in the US,"<p>On Thursday afternoon and early evening, people across the United States, Canada, and Mexico will be treated to a pretty cool astronomical phenomenon: a partial solar eclipse.</p> \n<p>The moon will pass between Earth and the sun and appear to take a nicely rounded bite out of the sun for<span> a period anywhere between a few minutes (for people on the East coast) to over an hour (for those on the West coast). The sky won't go dim (that only happens in a total eclipse), but it'll still be an interesting sight worth checking out.</span></p> \n<p>There is, however, a caveat: y<span>ou </span><b style=""line-height: 1.5;"">definitely </b><span>shouldn't look at the eclipse directly, as it can cause permanent eye damage. Instead, there are several ways to watch the eclipse happen safely. Here's what you need to know to see this astronomical event.</span></p> \n<h3>What is a solar eclipse?</h3> \n<p>A solar eclipse occurs when the moon's orbit of Earth takes it directly in between us and the sun, causing the moon to temporarily block out some of the sun's light.</p> \n<p><img src=""http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2380072/1280px-Geometry_of_a_Total_Solar_Eclipse.svg.0.png"" alt=""solar eclipse"" data-chorus-asset-id=""2380072""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">(<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Geometry_of_a_Total_Solar_Eclipse.svg"">Sagredo</a>)</p> \n<p>Places on Earth that fall within the moving path of the moon's umbra — the central part of its shadow — can briefly see a <b>total</b> eclipse, in which the entire sun gets blocked out by the moon, leaving just a faint shimmering ring of light in the otherwise darkened sky.</p> \n<p><b>Partial</b> eclipses are much more common, because they occur throughout the much wider penumbra region. Because of the alignment of the Earth, moon, and sun, in this case, only a partial eclipse will occur on Thursday — no part of the Earth will fall within the umbra.</p> \n<h3><span>What will the eclipse look like?</span></h3> \n<p>As the Earth rotates and your location enters the penumbra, the faint moon will gradually pass in front of the sun and block out a portion of it. Because it won't block the whole thing, the sky won't take on an eerie daytime darkness (as it does during a total eclipse), but it will dim slightly.</p> \n<p><img src=""http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2380174/Giumaiolini_-_Partial_Solar_Eclipse_-_Brazil_-_2007__by_.0.jpg"" alt=""solar eclipse time lapse"" data-chorus-asset-id=""2380174""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">A composite image showing the stages of a 2007 partial eclipse.

People on the West coast, who will see a much longer eclipse, will also get something a bit closer to this effect.</p> \n<p><img src=""http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2380246/1280px-Partielle_Sonnenfinsternis_Montage.0.jpg"" alt=""2011 eclipse"" data-chorus-asset-id=""2380246""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">A composite image of a 2011 partial solar eclipse, taken in Germany.

Additionally, the area of greatest eclipse is in extreme northern Canada, so people closer to there will see a greater portion of the sun blocked out by the moon.</p> \n<p><img src=""http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2380386/Screen_Shot_2014-10-22_at_12.39.19_PM.0.png"" alt=""partial eclipse map"" data-chorus-asset-id=""2380386""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">The concentric blue rings show the degree of eclipse, with the greatest eclipse seen by residents of extreme northern Canada.

It's never safe to look directly at the sun, even if it is partially blocked out. It might be tempting to try, but the light's intensity can quickly cause permanent damage to your retinas, potentially even leading to blindness. Using binoculars, a telescope, or a camera is an even worse idea, as the lenses focus the light further.</p> \n<p>There are, however, a few different solutions. One is a pair of <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.amazon.com/Eclipse-Glasses-Viewing-Sunspots-Flares/dp/B007RHW2IM"">eclipse glasses</a>, which are specifically made to block dangerous wavelengths of light. Don't try substituting normal sunglasses, as they're not designed to do this.</p> \n<p>Alternately, you can make a pinhole projector by poking a small hole in the side of a cardboard box or on a piece of paper. Hold the cardboard or paper in the sunlight as the eclipse occurs, and it'll project a miniature image of the eclipse on to the ground.

Between 2001 and 2009, the </span><a href=""http://www.spaceadventures.com/"" target=""_blank"">Space Adventures</a><span> company brokered deals between seven multi-millionaires and the Russian space agency, sending them to the International Space Station on Russian Soyuz rockets for a week or two, at a cost of $20 to $40 million each.

What aliens can teach us about global warming,http://www.vox.com/2014/11/9/7174157/global-warming-aliens,What if climate change is a predictable consequence of intelligent life?,"<p>There's no doubt that <a style=""line-height: 1.5;"" href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/global-warming/what-is-global-warming"" target=""_blank"">global warming</a> on Earth is a human-driven trend.</p> \n<p>But what if the tendency of intelligent species to alter their planet's climate was a more common phenomenon than we think? <span>In the vastness of the universe, it's very likely that other life forms have also evolved to an extent that they altered the atmosphere of their planets. If we looked at climate change as a predictable consequence of intelligent life — and a process that tends to follow specific patterns — </span><span>we might be better equipped to figure out how to stop it.</span></p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""right"">what if climate change is a predictable consequence of intelligent life?</q></p> \n<p>That's the idea put forth by astrophysicist <a href=""http://www.pas.rochester.edu/~afrank/afrankhome/afrank.html"" target=""_blank"">Adam Frank</a> and astrobiologist <a style=""line-height: 1.5;"" href=""http://www.astro.washington.edu/users/woody/"" target=""_blank"">Woodruff Sullivan</a> in an <a href=""http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213305414000484"" target=""_blank"">interesting new paper</a>. ""I<span>t's a change in perspective,"" Frank says. ""What we're saying is that what our species is</span><span> going through right now, from an astrobiology perspective, is probably not unique. It probably happens all the time — and we can learn from that.""</span></p> \n<p>It's a provocative way of looking at a familiar problem. I recently spoke to Frank to hear about the concept in greater detail.</p> \n<h3>1) We're likely not the only planet with intelligent life</h3> \n<p><span>""The first question you want to ask is, 'How many intelligent species have there ever been?'"" Frank says.</span></p> \n<p>Lots of people have asked this question before. The <a style=""line-height: 1.5;"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_equation"" target=""_blank"">Drake equation</a> multiples a number of factors (such as the fraction of planets in existence that might be habitable, the fraction of habitable planets that will actually spawn life, and the fraction of those planets that will spawn intelligent life) to try to answer it.</p> \n<p>Frank and Sullivan used the equation to try estimating the region of space you'd need to look at to find 1,000 planets will intelligent life. ""We found that <span>even if you're very pessimistic about how often life evolves on a planet, or how often it gets to where we are and produce energy-intensive technology — even if you think you need to</span><span> sort through 1,000 trillion planets to get one </span><span>that</span><span> has evolved intelligent life — </span><span>there would be 1,000 instances of it in just ten percent of the radius of the </span><span>visible</span><span> universe,"" Frank says.</span></p> \n<p>Of course, this is an enormous area, far more vast than we could ever hope to explore. And some of these species may be so different from us that the comparison can't tell us anything useful. But it still <span>means that if all our assumptions about planets and life are correct, other intelligent species have arose many, many times throughout history.</span></p> \n<h3>2) Other intelligent species have probably altered their climates too</h3> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""2440974"" alt=""kepler 20e"" src=""http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2440974/Kepler-20e_Planet.0.jpg""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Exoplanet Kepler-20e. (NASA/Ames/JPL-Caltech)</p> \n<p>This step isn't <i>quite </i>certain, but Frank and Sullivan believe that developing sophisticated technologies requires the use of energy-intensive processes that effectively multiply the work of individuals within a species<span>. The industrial revolution, in other words, couldn't have happened without coal.</span></p> \n<p>And the energy-intensive processes on other planets, they argue, <span>likely tipped the balance of those planets' atmospheres, just as </span><a style=""line-height: 1.5;"" href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/global-warming/where-do-greenhouse-gas-emissions-come-from"" target=""_blank"">greenhouse gas emissions</a><span> have tipped ours.</span></p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""right"">'i think with any species that gets to this point, you're going to get climate change'</q></p> \n<p>""I think we can show that with any species that gets to this point, if they're on the right kind of planet, you're going to get climate change,"" Frank says. He and Sullivan plan to try to demonstrate this in future work.</p> \n<p>It might seem like a strange idea, because we're so used to thinking of climate change as a uniquely human process. But, says Frank, ""two billion years ago, when plants evolved, they <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Oxygenation_Event"" target=""_blank"">oxygenated the atmosphere</a> and dramatically changed its composition."" The idea, in essence, is that if any species utterly dominates a planet's ecosystem, it'll be prone to altering the thin envelope of gas that surrounds it.</p> \n<p>This certainly doesn't mean we can't do anything about climate change now — it just means, according to Frank, that some amount of it was inevitable for us if we wanted an Industrial Revolution. ""I<span>t's not an inconvenient truth — it's an obvious truth,"" he says. ""Hundreds of years ago, if you knew how the atmosphere works and knew the Industrial Revolution was about to occur, you</span><span> could have predicted that we were scheduled for climate change.""</span></p> \n<h3>3) There are patterns in how species change their planets</h3> \n<p>The reason Frank and Sullivan were interested in figuring out how much space you'd need to encompass 1,000 intelligent civilizations is that with a large sample size, you can start to look for patterns in the way they alter their planets. This is the basis of any sort of science, and it's the basic idea of their approach.</p> \n<p>""You want enough species trajectories to take an average of,"" Frank says. ""Ultimately, that could let you <span>come up with a basic model for how a species interacts with a planet."" In theory, for instance, it might be that under certain conditions, species might tend to alter their atmosphere but then ultimately end up at a sustainable endpoint, while under other conditions, the species collapses.</span></p> \n<p>Here's what that might look like in graph form:</p> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""2438840"" alt=""frank"" src=""http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2438840/figure-4-630x384.0.png""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">A theoretical graph showing the trajectory of a sustainable civilization (blue) and a collapsing one (red).

(JTB Photo/UIG via Getty Images)</p> \n<p>Even though this approach to global warming might make it seem like a natural, inevitable outcome of intelligent life, Frank believes that stopping it is well within our capabilities. And a better understanding of the trajectories that civilizations take, he thinks, could be the key.</p> \n<p>""T<span>hey could be general: if your population gets to a certain point, and you're still using a certain technology that generates a lot of entropy, then you're going to end up on a collapse trajectory,"" he says. ""But if you switch, either by lowering your population or altering your technology, you end up on a sustainability trajectory.""</span></p> \n<p>To some, the <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/global-warming/how-do-we-stop-global-warming"">solution</a> to global warming might seem obvious — namely, cutting down on greenhouse gas emissions —<span> but Frank and Sullivan think that trying to model it in a broader context can help.</span></p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""center"">'even if you make decisions that you think are good, they're a bet on the future'</q></p> \n<p>""Even if you make decisions that you think are good, they're a bet on the future,"" Frank says.

Philae is stuck in a shadowy crater. Its battery is dying. What happens next?,http://www.vox.com/2014/11/13/7214941/philae-comet-rosetta,There's good news and bad news for the historic mission,"<p>Wednesday morning, Philae became the <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/11/12/7203081/philae-comet-rosetta"" target=""_blank"">first spacecraft ever to land on a comet</a>.</p> \n<p><!-- CHORUS_VIDEO_EMBED ChorusVideo:59248 --></p> \n<p>However, we now know that it didn't go exactly as planned. The craft's harpoons failed to engage, so Philae ended up bouncing off the comet, then landing two hours later, a kilometer away from its intended landing site.</p> \n<p>European Space Agency scientists now believe the lander is resting on its side, perhaps just inside the edge of a crater, with two of its three feet in contact with the comet. This certainly doesn't mean the mission is a failure, as Philae is still capable of gathering many types of data, including photos, and transmitting them up to Rosetta.</p> \n<p><img src=""http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2455304/comet_surface_vox.0.gif"" alt=""philae eye view"" data-chorus-asset-id=""2455304""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">A composite of six photos taken by Philae. (ESA)</p> \n<p>However, the rocky landing does pose some difficulties for the mission going forward. Here's a recap of the current situation.</p> \n<h3>The bad news</h3> \n<p><img src=""http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2453962/Screen_Shot_2014-11-13_at_8.32.18_AM.0.png"" alt=""philae map"" data-chorus-asset-id=""2453962""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Philae landed in the red area, and has bounced to somewhere within the blue area. (ESA)</p> \n<p>The fact that Philae is resting on its side in a crater poses two big problems.</p> \n<p>One is access to sunlight. The craft is equipped with solar panels, which are designed to top off its battery when the comet rotates to face the sun. In ideal conditions — such as on the relatively flat spot where Philae was supposed to land — this could have extended the craft's battery life significantly.</p> \n<p>But currently, only one of the craft's two solar panels is getting any sunlight, and it's only getting about 90 minutes of light for every 12-hour period.</p> \n<p>Without any solar power, Philae's battery was projected to empty about 64 hours after landing on the comet. Scientists are hoping to make one more scheduled data link between the lander and the orbiter late Friday evening (EST), but they believe that will be its last, based on battery simulations conducted on Earth.</p> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""2445358"" alt=""philae 2"" src=""http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2445358/Philae_touchdown.0.jpg""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">This is how Philae should have landed — rather than coming to a rest on its side.

But NASA was always hoping to get back into outer space.</p> \n<p>That's a big leap. The difference between putting astronauts in low-Earth orbit (where the ISS is) and deep space (such as the moon or Mars) is akin to the difference between sailing along the coast and crossing the ocean. The ISS orbits just 268 miles above Earth — a bit more than the distance from New York to Washington, DC.

A series of boosters, the first stage of the rocket, and the abort system were jettisoned.</li> \n<li>After completing the first orbit, a series of upper-stage rockets fired roughly two hours after launch, lifting Orion to its second, much-higher orbit: about 3,600 miles from Earth, which is 15 times as far up as the space station. On the way there, it passed through the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_Allen_radiation_belt"">Van Allen belt</a>, a layer of intense radiation that forced its external cameras to temporarily turn off to avoid damage. Orion then made one partial orbit of Earth at this high altitude.</li> \n<li>Roughly 3 and a half hours after launch, Orion separated from the service module and upper stage rocket and began descending to Earth on its own. Control thrusters fired to ensure the capsule was oriented correctly, and after about 45 minutes of descent, it hit the atmosphere traveling at roughly 20,000 miles per hour, with friction bringing the heat shield up to 4,000°F.</li> \n<li>Finally, a few minutes before landing, eight parachutes deployed, slowing the capsule down to about 20 miles per hour as it plunged into the Pacific Ocean off the coast of Baja California, to be recovered by the Navy.</li> \n</ol> \n<h3><img data-chorus-asset-id=""2511750"" alt=""orion 4"" src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2511750/15311567910_d7dd45f194_o.0.jpg""></h3> \n<p class=""caption"">(NASA)</p> \n<h3>What will Orion eventually be used for?</h3> \n<p>That's a difficult question to answer — because it will be the result of political wrangling, how Congress allocates funding, and perhaps the whims of whoever is elected president in 2016.</p> \n<p>The <a href=""http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/nasa-s-plan-to-visit-an-asteroid-faces-a-rocky-start/"">current plan</a>, announced by <a href=""http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/obama-space-plan/"">Obama in 2010</a>, is to use Orion to carry astronauts up to a small asteroid that would be tugged into orbit around the moon by a separate probe (still in development). The idea is that putting astronauts on an asteroid for a month-long mission sometime in the 2020s would give NASA the training and expertise necessary for an eventual crewed <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/mars-exploration/what-are-our-long-term-plans-for-exploring-mars"">mission to Mars</a>, which might occur sometime in the 2030s.</p> \n<p>This plan, however, is looking increasingly improbable.

We've never seen Pluto up close.

The probe is now just six months away from Pluto and will start preparing for the rendezvous when it wakes up from hibernation this Saturday at 3 pm EST. (Because the spacecraft is so far away, scientists won't receive a confirmation signal that the probe has been activated until 9:30 pm.)</p> \n<p><q class=""right"" aria-hidden=""true"">The new horizons probe will fly by pluto in july</q></p> \n<p>As New Horizons nears Pluto in the coming months, the craft will collect new information about the dwarf planet's geology and atmosphere and take the most detailed photos we've ever seen of it — along with its five moons.</p> \n<p>Even though Pluto seems very familiar to us, we know far less about it than any of the planets in our solar system. Two of its moons (Kerberos and Styx) have actually been discovered in the time since New Horizons left Earth in 2006.</p> \n<p>In the 1960s and '70s, the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mariner_program"">Mariner missions</a> showed us Mars, Venus, and Mercury, and in the 1970s and '80s, the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_program"">Voyager missions</a> showed us Jupiter, Saturn, Neptune, and Uranus. In much the same way, this summer, New Horizons will give us a close-up view of Pluto for the first time.</p> \n<h3>The New Horizons mission</h3> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2520290/051217nhpath.0.jpg"" alt=""new horizons 2"" data-chorus-asset-id=""2520290""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">(NASA)</p> \n<p>New Horizons was launched in January of 2006, and has now traveled about 2.9 billion miles from Earth, powered by an engine that harvests power from radioactively-decaying plutonium pellets. In total, the mission will end up costing an estimated <a href=""http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/missions/profile.cfm?MCode=PKB&amp;Display=ReadMore"">$700 million</a>.</p> \n<p>When the craft was launched, Pluto hadn't yet officially been demoted from planet to dwarf planet, and the mission was initially billed as a visit to the solar system's only unexplored planet. (In fact, Alan Stern, the principal investigator for New Horizons, has argued that <a href=""https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/news/display.cfm?News_ID=16236"">Pluto should still be considered one</a>.)</p> \n<p><q class=""right"" aria-hidden=""true"">the probe will take the best ever photos of pluto</q></p> \n<p>On the way there, in September 2006, the probe flew by Jupiter, taking photos of the planet (including the first close-ups of the <a href=""http://www.nasa.gov/centers/goddard/news/topstory/2006/little_red_spot.html"">Little Red Spot</a>) and its moons, and using Jupiter's gravity to slingshot out toward Pluto.</p> \n<p>Since then, the probe has spent most of its time in hibernation mode, so as to conserve energy and extend the life of its hardware.</p> \n<p>Beginning on January 15, 2015, as New Horizons gradually nears Pluto, the probe will begin using a number of instruments to gather data. Because of the vast distance between it and Earth, that data will take about 4.5 hours to arrive, and it actually won't be possible to send data at times, based on the probe's orientation.</p> \n<h3>What scientists hope to learn about Pluto</h3> \n<p>One of the most exciting things to come out of the mission will be the photos that New Horizons takes of Pluto. For now, the best images we have only show the dwarf planet as a blurry blob:</p> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2520282/Pluto.0.jpg"" alt=""pluto hubble"" data-chorus-asset-id=""2520282""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">(<a href=""http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/multimedia/display.cfm?Category=Planets&amp;IM_ID=10363"">NASA</a>)</p> \n<p>Starting in April, New Horizons will start taking photos better than the best photos we currently have (taken by the Hubble Space Telescope). As <a href=""http://www.planetary.org/blogs/emily-lakdawalla/2014/12031700-the-new-horizons-science.html"">Emily Lakdawalla of the Planetary Society puts it</a>, every photo the probe takes will be the best photo ever taken of Pluto. They may show polar ice caps, mountains, and perhaps even volcanic activity.</p> \n<p>New Horizons will also take images of Pluto and its moons using visible infrared and ultraviolet wavelengths of light, which will tell scientists more about their composition.</p> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2520286/20130726_new_horizons_diagram_f840.0.jpg"" alt=""new horizons"" data-chorus-asset-id=""2520286""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">(NASA)</p> \n<p>Other instruments will detect particles escaping from the dwarf planet's atmosphere, while a radio antenna will send signals through it. By analyzing these signals after they pass through the atmosphere and reach radio dishes on Earth, we'll get a better idea of the gases present in the atmosphere. Because the craft will collect so much data — and because it takes so long to send it back — it will actually continue transmitting it until 2016.</p> \n<p>Scientists will use this data for a few different things: They'll be able to calculate Pluto's mass more accurately, seek to better understand its geology, study clouds and wind movement on the dwarf planet's surface, and search for as-yes-undiscovered moons or rings.</p> \n<p>If the craft is still operational after its Pluto flyby, scientists hope to use it to study more distant objects in the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuiper_belt"">Kuiper belt</a> — a region that contains more than 100,000 rocky objects, including Pluto. It's still uncertain, because it depends locating a suitable object within New Horizons' narrow flight trajectory, but the probe may help us learn more about one or more of these objects sometime between 2018 and 2022.</p>",Space

Musk has <a href=""http://www.wired.com/2012/03/elon-musk-says-ticket-to-mars-will-cost-500000/"">famously likened this</a> to throwing away a brand-new 747 after a single flight to London.</p> \n<p>A controlled landing of a rocket — such as the Falcon 9 rocket that SpaceX launched last week, to carry an uncrewed space capsule up to the International Space Station to deliver cargo — could potentially let the company reuse the main component of the rocket in a future flight.</p> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2904938/CRS-4_Launch.0.jpeg"" alt=""spacex launch"" data-chorus-asset-id=""2904938""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">A long exposure photo of a SpaceX rocket launch in 2014.

(Pluto was famously demoted to a dwarf planet in 2006.) Yet in many ways, Ceres and Vesta are similar destinations. When Dawn was launched, they were the two largest rocks in the inner solar system that we had yet to explore.</p> \n<p>Vesta is heavily cratered, and rocky, while Ceres is much smoother, and icy.

But as the craft gets closer, it'll provide increasingly detailed images of the dwarf planet. By late January, NASA says, it'll be taking the highest resolution photos of Ceres we've ever seen — about 100 times more detailed than the ones so far.</p> \n<p>Last week, the <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/12/5/7337309/new-horizons-pluto"">New Horizons space probe</a> — which is quickly approaching the most famous dwarf planet, Pluto — officially began the ""encounter phase"" of its mission, and it's scheduled to become the first spacecraft to flyby Pluto in July.

It's not hard to see why: the distant cluster of galaxies pictured looks coincidentally like a smiley face.</p> \n<p>It's a pretty cute image. But the scientific truth about what's going on is far more fascinating.</p> \n<p>Let's start with the eyes. They're not stars, but entire galaxies — groups of 100 billion or more stars packed together, like our Milky Way. These galaxies are so large that traveling across them at the speed of light would take you hundreds of thousands of years or more. And each of these stars, astronomers now believe, likely has a planet orbiting it. It's very possible that among the hundreds of billions of planets in <em>each </em>of those eyes, there's <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/12/15/7393575/exoplanet-life"">some form of alien life</a>.</p> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3395644/black_hole_lensing_web.0.gif"" align=""right""></p> \n<p>The curves that make up the face's edges and smile, meanwhile, are the result of a phenomenon called <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_lens"">gravitational lensing</a>. We're not looking at a curved light source, but at light that's coming from far behind the galaxies and is traveling through spacetime that's bent by the enormous gravitational pull of them, as shown in the simulation at right (via <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Black_hole_lensing_web.gif"" target=""_blank"">Urbane Legend</a>)</p> \n<p>The particular ring-like phenomenon in the picture, called an <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein_ring"">Einstein ring</a>, occurs when the light source, the galaxies, and the viewer all line up directly. In essence, the galaxy eyes are acting as a magnifying glass, blowing up the light coming from behind them.</p> \n<p>Billions of stars, in galaxies so huge that they bend spacetime itself. But most of us (this author included) can't look at the image without seeing a lopsided smile. As <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/speaking-of-science/wp/2015/02/09/the-hubble-spotted-this-smiley-face-in-space/"">Rachel Feltman points out</a>, this is due to a phenomenon called <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareidolia"">pareidolia</a>: the inexplicable human tendency to see human faces in everything.</p>",Space

If the mission is successful, it will be the first to ever orbit two different extraterrestrial objects, which it achieved by using an </span><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_thruster"">ion thruster system</a><span> — an advanced form of propulsion that uses charged particles, rather than conventional propellant, allowing it to change trajectory while consuming much less fuel.</span></p> \n<p>After it enters Ceres' orbit on March 6, Dawn will spend about a year collecting all sorts of data — mapping the dwarf planet's surface, measuring the abundance of different elements on it, and looking for ice and water vapor. This information will help us better understand Ceres, and figure out whether it does have a layer of ice, or even a liquid ocean underneath.</p> \n<p>Ultimately, the goal of all this is to better understand how Ceres originally formed. We know that it coalesced during the early days of the Solar System, during the same time that other bits of rock (left over from the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protoplanetary_disk"" target=""_blank"">protoplanetary disk</a> that surrounded the early Sun) were coming together to form the Earth and other planets. So, on a very basic level, learning about the formation of Ceres will teach us about the formation of the Earth and the rest of the solar system, billions of years ago.</p>",Space
Russia is going to build its own space station â€” ending years of cooperation with the US,http://www.vox.com/2015/2/25/8107005/russia-space-station,It's bad news for the future of space exploration.,"<p>Russia <a href=""http://www.federalspace.ru/21321/"">announced</a> plans Tuesday evening to continue operating the International Space Station until 2024 — but afterwards, it will take its modules away to form its own space station.</p> \n<p>The ISS, which was assembled in orbit between 1998 and 2011, is made up mainly of modules owned by NASA and Roscosmos (the Russian space agency), along with some owned by Japan and Europe. Original plans called for it to be retired by 2020, but in January 2014, President Obama announced plans to <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/nasa-space-station-operation-extended-by-obama-until-2024-at-least/2014/01/08/9819d5c8-788e-11e3-8963-b4b654bcc9b2_story.html"">extend its mission to 2024</a>, and possibly to 2028.</p> \n<p>That, however, depended on Russia's cooperation, because under the station's current configuration, modules from both countries are needed to operate it. Last May, due to tensions from economic sanctions imposed over the <a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/ukraine-everything-you-need-to-know/what-is-the-ukraine-crisis"">invasion of Ukraine</a>, Russia <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/5/13/5714650/russia-just-evicted-nasa-from-the-international-space-station"">threatened to pull out of the project in 2020</a>.</p> \n<p>The new announcement ensures that ISS will live on until 2024 — but puts the future of US-Russia cooperation in space in doubt.</p> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""638528"" alt=""ISS"" src=""https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/assets/4397473/International_Space_Station_after_undocking_of_STS-132.jpg""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">The International Space Station.

And recently, as political tensions between the two countries have grown, space has remained one of few areas of cooperation.</p> \n<p>If Russia goes through with this plan, though, the era of space cooperation might be over. NASA currently relies on Russia to ferry its astronauts to the ISS, but by 2017, it's hoping that private American companies (<a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/private-space-flight/spacex-dragon"">SpaceX</a> and <a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/private-space-flight/boeing-spaceflight-cst-100"">Boeing</a>) will be able to <a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/private-space-flight/nasa-private-spaceflight-spacex-boeing"">carry out these missions</a> instead. Russia, meanwhile, says it plans to use several of its ISS modules to assemble its own, new space station, possibly as a precursor for human missions to the moon. NASA's <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/2/4/7977685/mars-nasa-orion-sls"">longer-term plans for crewed exploration</a> are uncertain, but no proposals involve collaboration with Russia.</p> \n<p>The good news is that in the short term, the complex, expensive ISS will continue to be used for research (helping scientists figure out, for instance, <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/1/26/7879779/scott-kelly-year-long-mission"">how to keep humans healthy in space</a>) instead of being thrown away prematurely for political reasons.

Some of these high-energy particles come from the sun (and spike whenever there's a particularly <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/7/30/5951263/a-catastrophic-solar-storm-just-barely-missed-earth-in-2012"">powerful solar storm</a>). Others, called <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_ray"">cosmic rays</a>, come from outside our solar system and might be produced by distant supernova.</p> \n<p>Neither of these have been a huge issue for human space exploration so far, since the only astronauts who have left the Earth's magnetic field so far were those on the Apollo missions to the moon — and they were only gone for a week or two at most.</p> \n<p>However, even that relatively short journey could theoretically cause problems. Between the Apollo 16 and 17 missions, for instance, the sun suddenly <a href=""http://srag-nt.jsc.nasa.gov/SpaceRadiation/What/What.cfm"">released a huge burst of protons</a> that would've been very dangerous for astronauts had a mission been underway.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""right"">radiation increases astronauts' risk of cancer</q></p> \n<p>For the journey to Mars — which will take at least six months each way — the risk would be much higher.</p> \n<p>The most straightforward problem is that space radiation increases astronauts' risk of cancer. NASA already caps how much time astronauts can spend on the<b> </b>International Space Station so that their lifetime cancer risk <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/31/science/space/data-show-higher-cancer-risk-for-mars-astronauts.html?_r=0"">doesn't increase by more than 3 percent</a>. A yearlong trip to Mars and back would slightly exceed this cap, even if no solar storms occurred — and in reality, the journey might end up taking longer.</p> \n<p>There might also be more acute effects of space radiation exposure. For instance, a few <a href=""http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/science/space/11576788/Mars-astronauts-could-develop-dementia-on-journey-to-Red-Planet.html"">recent studies</a> in rodents have suggested it could cause <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/4/25/5652566/space-radiation-causes-cognitive-impairments"">memory and focus problems</a> in astronauts, in some cases leading to irreversible dementia.</p> \n<p>All these reasons are why NASA is looking for new ideas for how to protect astronauts during the journey. We could just keep building spacecrafts with thick, heavy shields, but a lighter, novel system (such as a craft that <a href=""https://engineering.dartmouth.edu/~d76205x/research/Shielding/"">generates its own magnetic field</a> to fend off radiation) could be a better solution.

In much the same way, New Horizons will give us a close-up view of something even farther away: Pluto.</p> \n<p>Right now, the probe is already sending back the most detailed images we've ever taken of Pluto — but the dwarf planet still only appears as a hazy point of light. For instance, this image, <a href=""https://www.nasa.gov/feature/pluto-and-its-moon-charon-now-in-color"">released by NASA today</a>, shows Pluto with its largest moon, Charon, in orbit around it:</p> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""3812666""><img src=""https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3812666/loop_final.gif""></div> \n<p><br>Still, this is nothing compared to what we're going to see in just three weeks.

This was the seventh of 12 resupply missions SpaceX is <a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/private-space-flight/nasa-private-spaceflight-spacex-boeing"">carrying out for NASA</a>, and the capsule was scheduled to arrive there on Tuesday.</p> \n<p>The Falcon 9 is <a href=""http://www.spacex.com/falcon9"">made up of two parts</a>. The 138-foot-tall first stage burns for the first few minutes of flight, lifting the craft up to an altitude of about <a href=""http://www.spacex.com/sites/spacex/files/spacex_nasa_crs-6_presskit.pdf"">50 miles</a> before separating and falling back to Earth. A smaller, 49-foot-tall second stage burns for another six minutes, carrying the Dragon into orbit before disconnecting and falling back down to Earth, too.</p> \n<p>Normally, both of these parts — as well as the stages that make up other rockets, in general — break up into pieces as they plummet downward after the launch, eventually sinking into the ocean and becoming unusable. But on Sunday, as the first stage fell back to Earth, SpaceX planned to fire its engines in order to stabilize and guide it in for a controlled vertical landing that theoretically will look a lot like this:</p> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""3824390"">\n<img src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3824390/spacex-16.0.png""> \n<div class=""caption""> \n<p>A rendering of the barge landing.</p> \n</div> \n</div> \n<p>The plan was to land it on an autonomous uncrewed barge stationed east of Cape Canaveral. As the rocket descended, steerable fins affixed to its outside would have helped guide it and slow it down. As it nearedthe barge, a set of legs would have unfolded from its bottom, which should have allowed it to land gently upright.</p> \n<p>It might sound straightforward, but this is an extremely difficult, unprecedented maneuver, and Musk only predicted a 50 percent success rate during the previous attempts. Rockets are primarily designed to launch spacecrafts into orbit, which means that they're very tricky to slow down and steer on the way down. Still, the company says it's addressed the mechanical failures that doomed the last two attempts.</p> \n<p>Unfortunately, the launch failure rendered the landing attempt moot.</p> \n<div class=""vox-cardstack""><a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/private-space-flight/spacex-dragon"">Why does SpaceX get so much attention?</a></div> \n<p> \n<script src=""//embed.vox.com/cardstack.js""></script> \n</p> \n<h3>Why SpaceX wants to reuse a rocket</h3> \n<p>One of the factors that makes space travel so expensive that most of the equipment used to put cargo or people in orbit is destroyed after each use. As <a href=""http://www.spacex.com/news/2015/06/24/why-and-how-landing-rockets"">SpaceX put it in a recent press release</a>, ""We don’t throw away an airplane after a one-way trip from LA to New York. Each new plane costs about the same as one of our Falcon 9 rockets, but takes off and lands many times per day and is likely to conduct tens of thousands of flights over its lifetime.""</p> \n<p>From the beginning, this company has sought to make spaceflight cheaper with reusable components. Initially, SpaceX tried to use parachutes to slow down rocket stages as they descended. But they broke apart from stress and heat, so in 2011 the company switched to the current powered landing approach.</p> \n<p>Building a new Falcon 9 rocket <a href=""http://qz.com/153969/spacex-just-made-rocket-launches-affordable-heres-how-it-could-make-them-downright-cheap/"">costs $54 million</a>, but using it to put a payload into orbit takes only about $200,000 of fuel. While <a href=""http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2015/01/150109-spacex-barge-reusability-rocket-space/"">it'll cost some money to refurbish</a>, the rocket is still by far the most expensive component of their launch system — and reusing one, instead of building a new one each time, would hugely reduce launch costs.</p> \n<p>As a result, figuring out a way to reuse the rocket could make all sorts of missions — <a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/private-space-flight/private-spaceflight-satellites-spacex"">commercial satellite launches</a>, collaborations with NASA, and perhaps even <a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/private-space-flight/space-tourism-virgin-galactic"">space tourism</a> — cheaper by orders of magnitude, opening up all sorts of new possibilities in spaceflight.</p>",Space

See Venus and Jupiter pass right by each other tonight â€” without a telescope,http://www.vox.com/2015/6/30/8871547/jupiter-venus,Look west right after sunset to see something cool.,"<p>Tonight, after the sun sets, look west to see a cool astronomical phenomenon: the two brightest planets, Venus and Jupiter, will seemingly collide in the night sky.</p> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3836542/2015-06-30_13_40_57.0.gif"" alt=""venus jupiter"" data-chorus-asset-id=""3836542""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">(<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=29&amp;v=_ppuCZR8Mkw"">NASA</a>)</p> \n<p>Of course, the planets aren't actually hitting each other — in reality, they're hundreds of millions miles apart. But from our vantage point, they've been steadily approaching each other throughout the month of June. This evening will mark their closest pass — scientifically known as a conjunction — as they move within a third of a degree of each other.</p> \n<p>Because the two planets are so bright, they can easily be spotted without binoculars or a telescope and can even be seen before night completely falls. Just look to the west, and you'll see the two planets nearly touching, forming what looks like a double star fairly close to the horizon.</p> \n<p>These sorts of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjunction_(astronomy)"" target=""_blank"">conjunctions</a> occur because the planets orbit the sun at different rates: it takes Venus only 225 (Earth) days to complete a lap around the sun, compared to 12 (Earth) years for Jupiter. As a result, from our vantage point, they occasionally appear to pass each other in the sky — and if they align just right in a straight line with Earth, they appear to collide.</p> \n<p>Here are the two planets' current positions compared to Earth's (their sizes are not to scale):</p> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""3836586"" alt=""solar system"" src=""https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3836586/Screen_Shot_2015-06-30_at_1.51.42_PM.0.png""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">(<a href=""http://www.theplanetstoday.com/"">Theplanetstoday.com</a>)</p> \n<p>The planets will gradually drift apart until July 4, when they'll dip below the horizon and go out of view.

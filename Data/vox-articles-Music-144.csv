Aerosmith made more money from 'Guitar Hero' than from any one of its albums,http://www.vox.com/2014/7/11/5890237/aerosmith-made-more-money-from-guitar-hero-than-from-any-one-of-its-albums,"As album sales tank, musicians find creative ways to make up for lost profits","<p><span>Last year, Gizmodo</span>'s Matt Novak<span> </span><a href=""http://factually.gizmodo.com/aerosmith-made-more-money-on-guitar-hero-than-from-any-1594997008"">unearthed</a><span> an old PC Magazine </span><a href=""http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2330779,00.asp"">article</a><span> highlighting a remarkable fact about the music industry: While Aerosmith has </span><span>sold over 150 million albums and each member has an estimated fortune of well over $100 million, as of 2008, the majority of their money has come from … a video game.</span></p> \n<p>Back in 2007, Aerosmith licensed 29 of its songs to Activision, the American video game publisher behind the uber-successful franchise <i style=""line-height: 1.5;"">Guitar Hero</i>. One year later, in June 2008, <i style=""line-height: 1.5;"">Guitar Hero: Aerosmith</i> went on sale and brought in <a href=""http://www.celebritynetworth.com/articles/entertainment-articles/money-another-dimension-aerosmiths-video-game-millions/"" target=""_blank"" style=""line-height: 1.5;"">over $25 million</a> (almost 600,000 copies) in its first market week alone.

According to <a href=""http://multiplayerblog.mtv.com/2008/09/15/gh-money-for-aerosmith/"" target=""_blank"" style=""line-height: 1.5;"">Bobby Kotick</a>, CEO of Activision, Aerosmith's ""version of <i>Guitar Hero</i> generated far more in revenues than any Aerosmith album ever has.""</p> \n<p>This is part of a <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/music/shortcuts/2013/jul/15/spotify-musicians-money-thom-yorke"">much broader trend</a> of musicians getting less and less money from album or download sales and more and more from things like endorsements, cross-promotions, concerts, and video games.<span> And it's a trend even big-name musicians are having trouble coming to terms with. </span></p> \n<p><span>In summer 2014, in an editorial at the </span><a style=""line-height: 1.5; background-color: #ffffff;"" href=""http://online.wsj.com/articles/for-taylor-swift-the-future-of-music-is-a-love-story-1404763219"" target=""_blank"">Wall Street Journal</a><span>, Taylor Swift argued that, as m</span><span>y colleague Nilay Patel </span><a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/7/7/5878603/taylor-swift-doesnt-understand-supply-and-demand"">put it</a><span>, ""</span>artists should make high upfront investments in their albums, and then set correspondingly high prices on them at retail.""

Equally disheartening for musicians: digital sales were down 9.4 percent from the previous year. </span></p> \n<p>So how are musicians supposed to turn a profit? The real answer is probably something like Aerosmith's strategy. While in an era where it's basically free to create digital copies of songs, music itself isn't scarce at all, recognizable and marketable brands of the kind you can sell to, say, the makers of <i>Guitar Hero</i> <i>are</i> still scarce. An artist's <i>brand</i> is singularly her own, and as such, possesses incredible profit-making potential. In other words, Patel might be right: ""being Taylor Swift is perhaps more valuable than Taylor Swift's music.""</p>",Music
"""All About That Bass"" isn't actually body-positive",http://www.vox.com/2014/9/12/6126429/ban-meghan-trainor,"It's super catchy, but its lyrics promote mixed messages.","<p>Meghan Trainor's retro R&amp;B pop single ""All About That Bass"" dethroned Taylor Swift's ""Shake It Off"" this week to become <a href=""http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/6244214/meghan-trainor-tops-hot-100-all-about-that-bass"">the No. 1 single in America</a>. Although Trainor's name may not ring any bells — <span>""All About That Bass"" is the blonde pop star's first single —</span><span> her song is one of the most addicting tracks to come out this summer. But according to many, it's also incredibly problematic.</span></p> \n<p>Trainor's hit single is catchy. It's also — seemingly — a song about women accepting their bodies in a world where those bodies are held up to impossible standards and constantly ridiculed. <span>""All About That Bass"" is a messy song. In some verses, it uplifts the ideas of body positivity and self-worth, and in others, it destroys those ideals by putting down other women.  This confusion isn't that surprising since Trainor told Billboard she </span><a href=""http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/6259143/meghan-trainor-interview-all-about-that-bass-embracing-body"">doesn't consider herself a feminist</a><span>. But</span><span> the song</span><span> still might be a good entry point for many women to realize that the standards they are held to are unrealistic.</span></p> \n<h3><span>Is ""All About That Bass"" a body-positive anthem?</span></h3> \n<p><iframe frameborder=""0"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/7PCkvCPvDXk"" height=""480"" width=""853""></iframe></p> \n<p>Trainor's song is often referred to as a <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/14/fashion/meghan-trainor-colbie-caillat-and-sara-bareilles-address-body-image-issues.html"">body-positive anthem</a>. Body positivity is a movement that aims to help women (and men) <a href=""http://www.bodypositive.com/"">feel positively about their bodies</a> regardless of how they look or how much they weigh. The 20-year-old <a href=""http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/6244214/meghan-trainor-tops-hot-100-all-about-that-bass"">told Billboard</a> that ""All About That Bass"" is ""a song about loving your body ... and your booty."" I<span>n some ways that's definitely true, such as in the second verse of the song:</span></p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>""I see the magazines workin' that Photoshop/<br><span>We know that shit ain't real, C'mon now, make it stop/<br></span><span>If you got beauty beauty, just raise ‘em up/<br></span><span>Cause every inch of you is perfect from the bottom to the top""</span></p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Here, she encourages women to embrace their real bodies and feel confident in their size, which is tremendously empowering. She's also riding a wave of momentum. Trainor's anthem wasn't the only body-positive song this summer. Nicki Minaj released ""Anaconda"" and Jennifer Lopez released ""Booty,"" both about women being proud of their butts.</p> \n<p><span>""</span><span>It's hard not be charmed by the upbeat nature of the song and the lyrics suggesting 'every inch of you is perfect from the bottom to the top,'"" Renee Engeln, a professor at Northwestern studying body image and objectification, told me. ""Many of us have been clamoring to see more women in the media who manage to be body confident even if they aren't model-thin (or 'size two,' as Trainor puts it)."" </span></p> \n<p><span></span><span>But the song continues past that verse into ideas that, according to its critics, aren't that body-positive at all. </span></p> \n<p><span></span><span>""Everything is upbeat and happy; there's no ballads, and it's catchy,"" Trainor told </span><a style=""line-height: 1.5; background-color: #ffffff;"" href=""http://www.out.com/entertainment/music/2014/09/10/meghan-trainor-all-about-bass-t-pain-drunk-texting"">Out Magazine</a> of her new album<span>, and the song stands to that sentiment. </span><span>That is, if you don't think too much about it.</span></p> \n<h3>Trainor's form of body positivity is highly problematic</h3> \n<p><chorus-asset data-id=""693896"" class=""chorus-snippet browser_wide_media""> <img src=""http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/693896/14zNOTED-master675.0.jpg"" class=""small"" alt=""aatb meghan trainor""> </chorus-asset></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Screenshot from the video</p> \n<p>""All About That Bass"" quickly devolves into lyrics that both reinforce society's standards of beauty and measures the worth of a woman's body by how men view it.  After her ""ain't no size two"" line, Trainor sings that she's <span>""bringing booty back/Go ahead and tell them skinny bitches that."" </span></p> \n<p>""When you say that you're not a size two, but you're still desirable to men in a way that sounds like you're making up for the fact that you're not a size two, you're still adhering to the beauty standards your lyrics purport to be against,"" said Hillary Crosley, a staff writer at Jezebel who <a href=""http://jezebel.com/meghan-trainors-all-about-that-bass-hit-no-1-and-we-fe-1621020579"">wrote about the song hitting no. 1</a>.</p> \n<p><q class=""left"" aria-hidden=""true"">""I'm all for a more diverse perspective on female beauty, but what we need even more is simply less emphasis on female beauty""</q></p> \n<p><span></span><span>What's more, Trainor is hardly outside of what society says is an acceptable size for women to be. She may not be a size two, but she's certainly not a size 16 either. As feminist blogger </span><a href=""http://jennytrout.com/?p=7857"">Jenny Trout</a> <span>wrote</span><span>, what Trainor is really doing is creating an anthem that is ""</span><span>meant to make women who </span><i style=""line-height: 1.5;"">think </i><span>t</span><span>hey're fat feel good about the fat bodies they don't have, while constantly reminding them that they should feel fat.""</span></p> \n<p><span></span><span> Trainor's body positivity, in other words, includes women whose bodies are slightly larger than the insane, Photoshopped standard, but it's not all-inclusive for ""skinny bitches"" or women who are larger than a size eight. </span></p> \n<p><chorus-asset class=""chorus-snippet browser_wide_media"" data-id=""693794""> <img alt=""all about that bass "" class=""small"" src=""http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/693794/tumblr_n7wo3uowit1qkv33ao1_500.0.gif""> </chorus-asset></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Gif of the ""All About that Bass"" video</p> \n<p class=""p1"">""What I find problematic about the song is that it sets out a very limited definition of what it means to love your body. You can love it as long as men love it, and you can love it by putting down other women's bodies,"" Chloe Angyal, a senior editor at Feministing said to me.  She's referring to this particularly jarring line :</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p class=""p1"">""Yeah my mama she told me don't worry about your size/<br>She says, ""Boys like a little more booty to hold at night.""</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p class=""p1"">As L.V. Anderson, who wrote for Slate about <a href=""http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2014/09/05/meghan_trainor_s_new_song_title_is_just_as_anti_feminist_as_all_about_that.html"">Trainor's anti-feminist EP</a>, told me, this is ludicrous: ""Some men prefer women who are bigger; others don't. It's no more true that all men (or even most men) like curvy girls than that all men like skinny girls."" But the lyric also implies that the only reason to love your body is because it might be satisfying to a man.</p> \n<p class=""p1"">""In an ideal world, women wouldn't have to worry about being 'perfect from the bottom to the top.' Wouldn't it be great if we could worry about our intellect and our character and not the appearance of our bodies? I'm all for a more diverse perspective on female beauty, but what we need even more is simply less emphasis on female beauty,"" Northwestern's Engeln<span> said. </span></p> \n<h3>A gateway to feminism</h3> \n<p><span>As feminism becomes more deeply ingrained in pop culture, with Beyoncé and Taylor Swift claiming it as their own, it's easy to worry that the movement could be at risk of losing its power to commercialization. As a song built on female empowerment in its most basic — and questionable — form, ""All About That Bass"" is a perfect example of that. But maybe that's not a bad start for many young women.</span></p> \n<p>""<span>Songs like Meghan's will likely make her listeners feel the same way I did when I first heard</span><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq86e4Fhja0""> India.Arie's 'Video,'</a><span> like I'm the hottest woman in my bathroom mirror, let alone the street I'm walking down, regardless of what man is admiring my body. And that's the real point,"" Crosley said.</span></p> \n<p class=""p1"">Angyal agreed that, even if <a href=""http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/6259143/meghan-trainor-interview-all-about-that-bass-embracing-body"">Meghan Trainor doesn't consider herself a feminist</a>,  the song can be a good feminism entry point for Trainor's fans. ""<span>I don't think there's any such thing as perfectly feminist popular culture, but I do think that pop culture with a feminist bent can be a great gateway drug to the harder, less commercialized stuff,"" she said. ""</span><span>Meghan Trainor is no Susie Orbach. But if that's where your feminist journey starts, go for it.""</span></p>",Music

So while defining ""the Midwest"" is tough today, it has also been tough for hundreds of years. In his 1989 book ""<a href=""http://www.kansaspress.ku.edu/shomid.html"" target=""_blank"">The Middle West</a>,"" James Shortridge shows that the definition of ""Midwest"" has been highly changeable throughout US history. In the 1880s, Kansas and Nebraska were the ""Middle West,"" as opposed to the Dakota Territory (the Northwest) and the area that would be Oklahoma and Texas (the Southwest). It was in the early 20th century, he writes, that people began thinking about the Midwest as having broader definition looking more like the one we use today.</p> \n</div> \n</li> \n<li class=""list-5 clearfix""> \n<h4 class=""hide-at-large"">The Louisiana Purchase was a steal</h4> \n<div class=""vox-feature-photo vox-feature-column""> \n<div class=""vox-photo-hack"">\n<a href=""http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/677458/colormap.0.jpg"" target=""_black""><img class=""lazy zoom"" data-src=""http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/677458/colormap.0.jpg""></a> <a href=""http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/677458/colormap.0.jpg"" target=""_blank"" class=""icon-link-ext-alt""></a>\n</div> \n<p class=""caption""><a href=""http://www.earlyamerica.com/earlyamerica/maps/louisianapurchase/colormap.htm"">Early America.com</a></p> \n</div> \n<div class=""vox-feature-story vox-feature-column""> \n<h4 class=""show-at-large"">The Louisiana Purchase was a steal</h4> \n<p>After the Northwest Territory, most of the rest of the Midwest was added in 1803, with the Louisiana Purchase.

This map shows that in 1882, railways were densely concentrated in the Rust Belt and Midwest — even more densely concentrated than in the South, which had been a part of the United States for longer. Railways served very different purposes in those different regions, according to <a href=""https://people.hofstra.edu/geotrans/eng/ch2en/conc2en/american_rail_network_1861.html"">Hofstra University's</a> Geography of Transport Systems. While lines in the South simply connected rural areas with ports, the Midwestern lines were part of a network that connected them with cities. The expansion of the railroads was directly tied to the expansion of the agriculture industry, still a major force in the Midwest. One 2009 <a href=""http://www.nber.org/papers/w15520.pdf"">NBER paper</a> estimated that railroads were responsible for at least one-fourth of the roughly 150 million acres of farmland added to the US during the 1850s, and maybe even a majority.</p> \n</div> \n</li> \n<li class=""list-14 clearfix""> \n<h4 class=""hide-at-large"">The rise and fall of rail</h4> \n<div class=""vox-feature-photo vox-feature-column""> \n<div class=""vox-photo-hack"">\n<a href=""http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/677608/Screen_Shot_2014-09-02_at_9.40.05_AM.0.png"" target=""_black""><img class=""lazy zoom"" data-src=""http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/677608/Screen_Shot_2014-09-02_at_9.40.05_AM.0.png""></a> <a href=""http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/677608/Screen_Shot_2014-09-02_at_9.40.05_AM.0.png"" target=""_blank"" class=""icon-link-ext-alt""></a>\n</div> \n<p class=""caption""><a href=""https://people.hofstra.edu/geotrans/eng/ch3en/conc3en/usrail18402003.html"">Hofstra University</a></p> \n</div> \n<div class=""vox-feature-story vox-feature-column""> \n<h4 class=""show-at-large"">The rise and fall of rail</h4> \n<p>Put another way, the westward expansion of the US into what is now the Midwest was driven by, and helped drive, rail expansion. This chart shows the explosive growth of rail mileage in the second half of the 19th century. Though trains are no longer nearly as prominent in the Midwest as they once were, farmers still depend upon railways like BNSF to deliver grain to customers. In fact, rail delays this year frustrated many farmers, as <a href=""http://www.mprnews.org/story/2014/03/26/business/train-delays"">Minnesota Public Radio</a> reported. The cause of those delays differs depending on whom you ask: railways blame congestion and a brutal winter, while frustrated farmers blame oil shipments from North Dakota.

This changed the face of many Midwestern cities. According to the <a href=""https://www.census.gov/dataviz/visualizations/020/"">Census Bureau</a>, Gary, Indiana went from 2.3 percent black in 1910 to 18.3 percent black in 1940; those years are generally counted as the start and end of the first Great Migration. Similarly, Chicago's black population grew by 148 percent between 1910 and 1920 alone, and Detroit's grew by 611 percent, according to <a href=""http://www.history.com/topics/black-history/great-migration"">History.com</a>.

By 2039, temperatures are expected to grow appreciably across the region, by an average of 2.4 to 2.8 degrees Fahrenheit, a number that will only increase as time goes on and the atmosphere's carbon levels keep growing. One way the UCS depicts this is via the idea of ""climate migration,"" or comparing states' future climates with other states' climates today. In the UCS's most extreme, higher-emissions scenario, Illinois' climate will eventually be something like that in southern Texas today. Michigan's lower peninsula, meanwhile, could feel like North Texas today.

The idea was to keep their sewers from polluting Lake Michigan (and therefore their water supply), as <a href=""http://www.citylab.com/politics/2014/01/century-later-expensive-lesson-reversing-chicago-river/8069/"">CityLab</a> explains. The city accomplished this by building the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal, which connects the Chicago River and the Des Plaines River, which connect Lake Michigan to the Mississippi River. Altogether, this new system stopped the Chicago River from dumping into Lake Michigan by reversing its exit into the lake and having it instead connect to Des Plaines River. The project worked, <a href=""http://www.lib.niu.edu/2001/ihy010452.html"">stopping</a> water-born illness among city residents. All this sounds like an impressive feat, but today it's causing new problems, as the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported in <a href=""http://www.jsonline.com/news/wisconsin/97745959.html"">2010</a>. The biggest one is invasive species, particularly the Asian Carp. The Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal means those fish can get from the Mississippi to the Chicago River and then into Lake Michigan. These massive, leaping, invasive fish can not only disrupt ecosystems and also pose a threat to boaters. It's not just Asian carp, either; invasive fish have proven capable of getting past an electric barrier <a href=""http://www.jsonline.com/news/wisconsin/report-fish-swim-past-electric-barrier-meant-to-block-asian-carp-b99170326z1-237051941.html"">constructed</a> to keep them out. To solve the problem, the Army Corps of Engineers earlier this year <a href=""http://www.jsonline.com/news/opinion/closing-the-chicago-canal-is-still-the-best-option-for-great-lakes-b99179382z1-239185171.html"">released</a> eight proposals to keep fish out of the lake, including the possibility of reconstructing the former natural barrier.</p> \n</div> \n</li> \n<li class=""list-30 clearfix""> \n<h4 class=""hide-at-large"">A rapidly-drying aquifer</h4> \n<div class=""vox-feature-photo vox-feature-column""> \n<div class=""vox-photo-hack"">\n<a href=""http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/678154/Ogallala_changes_1980-1995.0.svg"" target=""_black""><img class=""lazy zoom"" data-src=""http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/678154/Ogallala_changes_1980-1995.0.svg""></a> <a href=""http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/678154/Ogallala_changes_1980-1995.0.svg"" target=""_blank"" class=""icon-link-ext-alt""></a>\n</div> \n<p class=""caption""><a href=""hhttps://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Ogallala_changes_1980-1995.svg"">Kbh3rd</a></p> \n</div> \n<div class=""vox-feature-story vox-feature-column""> \n<h4 class=""show-at-large"">A rapidly-drying aquifer</h4> \n<p>Climate change isn't the only environmental catastrophe the Midwest faces; parts of it also could soon be battling a water shortage. The Ogallala Aquifer, which underlies most of Nebraska, as well as large swaths of Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas, is at risk of being depleted. An aquifer is an underground source of water, where water is stored in rock or other materials. As Vox's Brad Plumer <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/09/12/how-long-before-the-midwest-runs-out-of-water/"">wrote</a> in 2013, researchers recently found that 30 percent of the aquifer under Kansas was already depleted, with 39 percent more set to be pumped out within the next half-century. This map shows areas where water usage from the aquifer has outstripped rainfall (red areas) … and that's just from 1980 to 1995. Agriculture is the main culprit, so farmers may have to undertake more aggressive conservation techniques.</p> \n</div> \n</li> \n<hr> \n<h3>The lay of the land</h3> \n<div class=""chorus-snippet m-fishtank no-responsive-video""> \n<script type=""text/javascript""><!-- \nif (!window.OX_ads) { OX_ads = []; } OX_ads.push({ ""auid"" : ""554717"" }); \n// --></script> \n<script type=""text/javascript""><!-- \ndocument.write(""<scr""+""ipt src=""http://ox-d.sbnation.com/w/1.0/jstag""></scr""+""ipt>""); \n// --></script> \n</div> \n<li class=""list-32 clearfix""> \n<h4 class=""hide-at-large"">Lake Superior isn't just huge; it's deep, too</h4> \n<div class=""vox-feature-photo vox-feature-column""> \n<div class=""vox-photo-hack"">\n<a href=""http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/687558/Great_Lakes_Profile.0.jpg"" target=""_black""><img class=""lazy zoom"" data-src=""http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/687558/Great_Lakes_Profile.0.jpg""></a> <a href=""http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/687558/Great_Lakes_Profile.0.jpg"" target=""_blank"" class=""icon-link-ext-alt""></a>\n</div> \n<p class=""caption""><a href=""http://www.people.iup.edu/kpatrick/Great%20Lakes.shtml"">Indiana University of Pennsylvania</a></p> \n</div> \n<div class=""vox-feature-story vox-feature-column""> \n<h4 class=""show-at-large"">Lake Superior isn't just huge; it's deep, too</h4> \n<p>They all look huge from above, but not all Great Lakes are created equal.

Because of all that water, one fact you'll often hear repeated in Minnesota is that it has 90,000 miles of shoreline — more than Florida, California, and Hawaii combined, according to the Minnesota <a href=""http://www.sos.state.mn.us/docs/minnesota_fun_facts_proofed_copy_.pdf"">Secretary of State</a>. That may be common knowledge, but last year blogger Chris Finke set out to prove (or disprove) it. According to data he obtained from Minnesota's Department of Natural Resources, Minnesota has 44,926 miles of lake shoreline. That's more than Florida's 8,400 miles and Louisiana's 7,700 miles, according to the <a href=""https://www.census.gov/compendia/statab/2012/tables/12s0364.pdf"">Census Bureau</a> — and while that doesn't include those other states' lakes (and though it comes out to only half the 90,000 mile figure), it's still impressive. Of course, that's just Minnesota's lakeshore compared to other states' ocean shorelines. So Finke also compiled estimates online of lake shoreline in all those states. The result? Minnesota indeed beats those three states combined, but only if you count streams and rivers. Finke's results are shown to the right.</p> \n</div> \n</li> \n<li class=""list-35 clearfix""> \n<h4 class=""hide-at-large"">Is Kansas as flat as a pancake?

Except for two things: 1) Several Midwest cities, like Chicago and Minneapolis-St. Paul, serve as major airline hubs, so there are plenty of Midwestern stopovers. And 2) seriously, using the term ""flyover country"" is just downright rude (for a much lengthier and more articulate tirade on this topic, read Matthew Wolfson's fantastic dissection of the term and Midwestern culture at the <a href=""http://www.newrepublic.com/article/117113/midwest-not-flyover-country-its-not-heartland-either"">New Republic</a>).

Clearly, among Protestants Evangelical Lutheran Church in America members and Missouri Synod Lutherans (dark and light blue, respectively) run the show in Minnesota, the Dakotas, northern Iowa, and parts of Wisconsin … and that doesn't even include Wisconsin Synod Lutherans, who are likely represented by some of the brown-colored counties in Wisconsin. Farther south and east, Methodists (green) are the main denomination. Missouri stands apart in being almost entirely dominated by Southern Baptists.

You'd think it would be easy, since cows have that high center of gravity on those spindly-looking legs. But get right up close to a full-grown Holstein and you'll realize that you'd have to be a linebacker to even have a chance at tipping it. <a href=""http://modernfarmer.com/2013/09/cow-tipping-myth-or-bullcrap/"">Modern Farmer</a> did an excellent dissection of the physics of cow-tipping last year, complete with mathematical calculations of the amount of force you'd need to actually pull off this feat.

"Kanye's latest rant was silly, but it made 5 good points",http://www.vox.com/2014/9/17/6329093/5-things-kanye-knows-that-you-might-not-know,"Kanye West, famed American rapper and husband of Kim Kardashian, gave quite the speech in the middle of his concert in Brisbane, Australia, Monday night.","<p>Kanye West, famed American rapper and husband of Kim Kardashian, gave<a href=""http://www.vulture.com/2014/09/kanye-responds-to-wheelchair-incident.html""> quite the speech</a> right in the middle of his concert in Brisbane, Australia, Monday night. Media reports that he had demanded that a concert-goer in a wheelchair stand up at a previous show had stirred his ire.</p> \n<p>West is known for his legendary rants, and this one is full of gems. The gist of it is that West is a ""married Christian man with a family,"" and that he should, therefore, be left alone, even though he is one of the world's biggest celebrities. In the course of the five-minute rant, though, West preaches some truth.</p> \n<p><span>Here are five things Kanye West knows that you might not: </span></p> \n<h3>1)There was no actual ""wheelchair incident""</h3> \n<p>The whole reason West felt he needed to go on this tirade is because he felt he was being misrepresented in the media. This weekend, several media outlets reported that West ""<a href=""http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/09/14/kanye-west-stops-concert-to-yell-at-wheelchair-bound-kid-stand-up.html"">demanded</a>"" that handicapped audience members stand up to listen to his music at his concert in Sydney. The story <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/09/14/kanye-west-wheelchair_n_5818116.html"">spiraled out of control</a>, with some claiming that West sent his bodyguard into the crowd to force people to stand. This story spread mostly because Kanye West is a huge egomaniac, which made it seem vaguely believable. The man did name his last album <i>Yeezus</i>, after all.</p> \n<p>As shown<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De_1VKqNoLg""> in the video of the event,</a> however, West did, indeed, pause the song to get people to stand up. But once he realized the fan in question was in a wheelchair, he simply returned to the song.</p> \n<h3>2) Which show Michael Strahan is on</h3> \n<p>Michael Strahan, former NFL player and co-host of <i>Live! with Kelly and Michael</i> is also on <i>Good Morning America, </i>as of earlier this summer.</p> \n<p>""Michael Strahan is still at the <i>Today</i> show — no, <i>Good Morning America</i>,"" West said during his speech. The correction was right. Even we didn't know Strahan was on <i>Good Morning America </i>in addition to <i>Live!</i></p> \n<h3>3) Being offensive is actually his brand</h3> \n<p>Kanye West is one of most quotable rappers out there (don't forget that he<a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/7/21/5923721/Kanye-West-crazy-quotes-blowfish""> calls himself a ""blowfish</a>""), but he's also a damn good rapper, partly <i>because</i> he is offensive. And he's nothing if not self-aware about it.</p> \n<p><span>""Don't I say offensive shit here and there, like, so wait a second, that's my brand!"" West said during his speech. He added this caveat: ""W</span><span>hat I'm sayin' is, you've got like 12 years that we put in positive music. How many people ever heard one of my songs on their way to work — they heard it, and it made them feel better?""</span></p> \n<p>Got that? Kanye West's raps make people feel better.</p> \n<h3>4) What ""Ben Affleck statements"" are</h3> \n<p>Making fun of Ben Affleck was pretty funny three years ago, but Kanye is still throwing shade. He said, ""[If you]make the decision to pick one woman and raise a family, anyone here that's married or that's in a relationship knows that there's enough things workin' against you. I'm not going to make one of them Ben Affleck statements and shit.""</p> \n<p>It seems likely he's referencing Affleck's 2013 Oscar acceptance speech for the film <i>Argo,</i> in which Affleck told his wife Jennifer Garner that their marriage is ""work"" but that there's no one he'd rather work with. Did you remember this happened? No? Kanye West did.</p> \n<p><iframe width=""853"" height=""480"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/FtLKn5Y1ulc"" frameborder=""0""></iframe></p> \n<h3><span>5) Violence in America is an important story</span></h3> \n<p>About a minute into his rant, West pauses to call out media outlets, saying:</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>""I want you to run that, right, since this is such big media-press-news and everything that obviously they trying to demonize me for. It's like, ‘Welcome to today's news, ladies and gentlemen.' We've got Americans getting killed on TV, kids getting killed every weekend in Chicago, unarmed people getting killed by police officers ...""</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Kanye knows that violence in America is a massive issue.  <a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/gun-violence-facts/guns-per-capita-america-us"">Gun violence.</a> <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/8/25/6061449/black-on-black-crime-ferguson-murder-rate"">Black-on-black violence</a>. <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/8/21/6053811/white-on-white-murder"">White-on-white violence</a>.<a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/9/17/6243107/facts-statistics-violence-against-women-domestic-abuse""> Violence against women</a>.</p> \n<p>When West talks about ""<a style=""background-color: #ffffff;"" href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/8/11/5988925/mike-brown-killing-shooting-case-ferguson-police-riots-st-louis"">unarmed people getting killed by police officers</a>,"" he's referencing the shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, last month, and his point is well taken. Should Ferguson and stories like it be more important than something Kanye West supposedly said at a concert? Almost certainly.</p>",Music

Mix it up this week with a playlist of great covers,http://www.vox.com/2014/9/20/6559127/mix-it-up-this-week-with-a-playlist-of-great-covers, ,"<p>A tried-and-true move for a young musician is to cover some big hits, ones the public will recognize, as a way of coasting atop other successes. Oftentimes, this backfires horribly because the new version does not live up to the version ingrained in public memory. But done well (or done well when covering a song that perhaps didn't get famous <i>enough</i> on initial release), a cover can show an artist's relevance and even creativity as well as anything.</p> \n<p>In a few instances, a cover can become more famous than the original. Maybe your weekend feels like every other weekend you've ever had, like a cover (get it?) of every weekend before it. But can't you make your weekend iconic in its own way, a slightly different, somehow better version of things you've done before?</p> \n<p><b>""Hallelujah""</b> by Jeff Buckley</p> \n<p>By now, Jeff Buckley's ""Hallelujah"" is probably more famous than the original by Leonard Cohen, which was released in 1984. Buckley's version is slower, has more piano, and is deeply beloved.</p> \n<p><span><b>""Billie Jean""</b> by </span>The Civil Wars</p> \n<p>Before they broke up, The Civil Wars, known for their beautiful harmonies and the four Grammys they won for debut album <i>Barton Hollow</i>, created one of the best covers of Michael Jackson's pop-hit ""Billie Jean.""</p> \n<p><span><b>""Hounds of Love""</b> by </span>The Futureheads</p> \n<p>Kate Bush originally sang ""Hounds of Love"" in her moody, seductive voice, but post-punk band The Futureheads kicks it up six notches and adds much more guitar, making it less melodramatic and more fun than the original.</p> \n<p><b>""Dark End of the Street</b><span><b>""</b> by </span><span>Cat Power</span></p> \n<p>Even when sung by Chan Marshall (aka Cat Power), this song still sounds like the same Memphis soul that James Carr recorded in 1967. It's breathy and powerful, and when laid over a simple guitar, the lyrics really shine.</p> \n<p><b>""Spit on a Stranger"" </b>by Nickel Creek</p> \n<p>Pavement is a band beloved for how it fit into the grunge era, but Nickel Creek takes ""Spit on a Strange"" puts a twangy bluegrass twist on this tune. ""You're a bitter stranger,"" Chris Thile sings over a fiddle. Surprisingly, it works.</p> \n<p><span><b>""</b></span><span><b>Georgia on My Mind""</b> by </span><span>Willie Nelson</span></p> \n<p>Ray Charles originally performed ""Georgia on My Mind"" in 1960, and few others have been able to do the song justice. Willie Nelson managed the feat, however, by slowing the song down and drawing out his notes over the subtle background guitar.</p> \n<p><b>""Hurt"" </b>by Johnny Cash</p> \n<p>""Hurt"" was one of Cash's last hits before his death. Over the minor chords, Cash's muddled voice sounds filled with pain and frustration, a fitting tribute to the original version by rock band Nine Inch Nails.</p> \n<p><b>""I Say a Little Prayer""</b> by Aretha Franklin</p> \n<p>Many of Aretha's most famous songs are actually covers. This one is a spin on Dionne Warwick's 1967 song, which charted at no. 4. Aretha released her version just one year later with background chorus singers and the perfect piano background.</p> \n<p><b>""Sealion"" </b>by Feist</p> \n<p>""Sealion"" is a recreation of a traditional American folk song. It isn't a cover, per se, in that there is no definitive version of the song, but Feist's version not both highlights her vocal skills and manages to keep the chanting, ephemeral feeling of a song passed down from generation to generation.</p> \n<p><b>""Torn"" </b>by Natalie Imbruglia</p> \n<p>Natalie Imbruglia's ""Torn"" was a massive pop sensation in 1997. It hit no. 1 on the Billboard chart and earned her a Grammy nomination for Best Female Pop Vocalist. ""Torn"" is a perfect pop song with heart and a catchy melody. But what you might not have known is that it's also a cover of a 1995 Los Angeles band called <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V1SH1YdITDI"" style=""line-height: 1.5;"">Ednaswap.</a></p> \n<p><b>""I Think We're Alone Now"" </b>by Tiffany</p> \n<p>""I Think We're Alone Now"" was a hit when it was originally released in 1967 by Tommy James and the Shondells, but teenage pop sensation Tiffany rocketed the song to the top spot in the U.S. the U.K, and Australia in 1987.</p> \n<p><b>""It's Oh So Quiet"" </b>by Björk</p> \n<p>""It's Oh So Quiet"" was the B-side to Betty Hutton's ""Murder, He Says."" When Icelandic singer Björk covered the song in 1995, it became her biggest hit, which is understandable because the song has all of Bjork's more out-there elements, but packages them in a more approachable format</p> \n<p><i><a href=""http://open.spotify.com/user/voxdotcom"">Follow Voxdotcom on Spotify</a> for every week's playlist and some mid-week jams</i></p> \n<p><iframe src=""https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify:user:voxdotcom:playlist:5TN0tgjMzgCt61xQLDDdbO"" width=""300"" height=""380"" frameborder=""0"" allowtransparency=""true""></iframe></p>",Music
Here's why millions of Americans are binge-watching Korean dramas,http://www.vox.com/2014/9/24/6832951/heres-why-millions-of-americans-are-binge-watching-korean-dramas,"There's a Netflix for K-Dramas, and most of its users aren't Asian.","<p>It used to be that the TV series Americans were able to consume were all pretty much produced right here in the US. Acclaimed shows from other shores — even countries that spoke English — rarely showed up in America, and if they did, it was only sporadically on PBS. But in the last several years, that's been changing. More and more British, Canadian, and Australian series arrive here every day, and sites like Hulu bring in shows that <i>aren't</i> in English (like <i>Hatufim</i>, the Israeli show that served as inspiration for <i>Homeland</i>).</p> \n<p>And then there's <a href=""http://www.dramafever.com/"">DramaFever</a><span>, an online video streaming service specializing in TV series and films from Asia. DramaFever has become one of the leading distributors of international content in the United States since its 2009 launch.</span></p> \n<p><q class=""left"" aria-hidden=""true"">""we thought our audience was going to be korean-american — and we couldn't have been more wrong.""</q></p> \n<p>DF says its total monthly unique viewers — which includes syndication partners like Hulu and YouTube — quadrupled from 2012 to 2013, growing from 2.5 million to 10 million. And it just keeps growing, currently sitting at 20 million.</p> \n<p>Big brands have noted this rapid growth, as <a href=""http://www.adweek.com/videowatch/korean-dramas-hook-millennial-viewers-who-speak-spanish-and-english-157679"" target=""_blank"">Ad Week reports</a>. Toyota, AT&amp;T, Verizon, and Samsung have all purchased ads on DramaFever. The site's content is available in more places than ever and has expanded beyond Asian programming: it's signed deals with Hulu, AMC, and YouTube, and in December 2012, it began streaming programming from Spanish language broadcaster <span>Telemundo</span><i style=""line-height: 1.5;"">. </i></p> \n<p><span>When DramaFever launched with just four employees, co-founders </span><span>Suk Park and Seung Bak weren't expecting things to take off quite like they did</span><span>. ""</span><span>When we started five years ago, we thought our audience was going to be Korean-American,"" Park told me over the phone. ""But we couldn't have been more wrong.""</span></p> \n<h3>Non-Asians really, really love Korean dramas</h3> \n<p><span>Indeed, 85 percent of DramaFever's audience, Park said, is non-Asian, with 45 percent being Caucasian and 25 percent being Latino. ""All types of ethnicities,"" Park told me, ""are seeking out foreign content"" because it ""speaks to them more than … traditional television.""</span></p> \n<p><chorus-asset class=""chorus-snippet browser_wide_media"" data-id=""1396536""><img alt=""DF infographic"" class=""small"" src=""http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/1396536/dfinfo_2.0.jpg""></chorus-asset></p> \n<p class=""caption"">(<a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.dramafever.com/infographic/"">DramaFever</a>)</p> \n<p><span>DramaFever carries a diverse library of content but is mostly known for its Korean dramas, more popularly known as K-dramas. K-dramas vary in story and setting, of course, but what they have in common is that each series is self-contained — meaning, one season long and telling a complete story — and usually takes as its central plot a chaste romance. In fact, a first kiss usually happens seven or eight episodes into the narrative, which usually contains around 16 to 20 episodes. ""What is focused on [in K-dramas] is relationships,"" Park said. ""Not really sex but how true lovers struggle to make romance a reality.""</span></p> \n<p><q class=""right"" aria-hidden=""true"">""Entertainment is a gateway to culture.""</q></p> \n<p>Take, for example, DF's new drama <i>Blade Man</i>, which tells the love story of a video game executive and a game designer. It sounds pretty much like the setup for your typical meet cute, until you realize that the rich executive, played by Korean star Lee Dong-Wook, has a condition where his anger manifests as actual blades growing from his body. Then there's <i>My Love From The Star</i> — which is being <a href=""http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/my-love-star-abc-remake-733887"" target=""_blank"">remade</a> by the American network ABC — which is about a famous actress who falls in love with a 400 year-old alien. And in a few weeks, DF will premiere <i>Servant</i>, which the streaming service is billing as a version of <i>Sex and the City </i>set during the time of Korea's Chosun Dynasty.</p> \n<p>Park admits that DramaFever's content differs from what Western audiences are used to. But that might be why his service is finding such success. According to Park, Millennials — who make up DF's largest audience — think it's important to explore cultural narratives that differ from their own. As a ""machine of empathy,"" Park thinks television is one way to open up and explore fresh narratives. ""Entertainment is a gateway to culture,"" he says.</p> \n<p class=""caption""><chorus-asset data-id=""1399748"" class=""chorus-snippet browser_wide_media""> <img src=""http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/1399748/My_Lovable_Girl_Hi_res_1.0.jpg"" class=""small"" alt=""My Lovable Girl ""> </chorus-asset></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Jung Ji-hoon and Krystal Jung in My Lovable Girl. (DramaFever)</p> \n<h3><span>The 'Confucian values' of K-dramas</span></h3> \n<p>K-dramas differ from American soaps in ways other than their lack of sex. Park told me much of his site's content is ""deeply rooted in traditional Confucian values,"" like responsibility and respect. Most of DF's stories, says Park, explore the tension between loving someone and ""the responsibility that character feels to his family, career, and other types of relationships.""</p> \n<p>Seventy percent of DramaFever's catalogue is from Asia, with more than half of that comprised of Korean titles. The rest is imported from Japan, Taiwan, and other Asian countries. DramaFever also airs the aforementioned Spanish-language content from Telemundo, and its children's channel includes animated programming from France and the United Kingdom. ""It's never too early to expose kids to different storytelling from around the world,"" says Park.</p> \n<h3>All things K</h3> \n<p>A writer at <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.dramabeans.com/"">Dramabeans</a>, known as Javabeans, was quoted in <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://geekout.blogs.cnn.com/2012/06/22/the-jump-from-j-drama-to-k-drama/"">CNN</a> discussing how pop culture provides a ""depoliticized"" bridge between two disparate cultures.</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>Dramas and pop culture bridge a gap that can't be achieved through official policy or political maneuvering. What people respond to is the universality of the themes, coupled with the unique perspective of this one particular culture. It's fresh, without being quite foreign.

Azalea also appeared on Ariana Grande's ""Problem"" this summer, making her only the<a href=""http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/6077635/hot-100-john-legend-all-of-me-ariana-grande-iggy-azalea""> fifth female artist </a>to have two singles among the top five songs at the same time, joining Mariah Carey and Taylor Swift. <b> </b>Macklemore, too, has done quite well for himself.

Most would probably claim that Jay-Z is closer to a ""king of rap"" than Macklemore is, and that Nicki Minaj or Lil' Kim would be a better pick for ""queen of rap"" than Iggy. Or if you want to go old school why not crown Notorious B.I.G. or 2Pac or Eve or MC Lyte.</p> \n<p><span>Thankfully, this is just trolling.</span></p>",Music
You'd be amazed to learn how much music is disappearing,http://www.vox.com/2014/10/13/6840233/music-archiving-disappearance-history,Conservators are working to recover old albums that they might have missed their first time around â€” while trying to find the sounds that need to be archived today.,"<p>In 1903, Huddie William Ledbetter was one of the strongest voices in American folk and blues. Known as Lead Belly, Ledbetter was known as the King of the Twelve String Guitar, but he also played the piano, the mandolin, the harmonica, and the violin. He wrote songs about racism and politics. His songs have been covered by everyone from Elvis Presley to Nirvana. They tell hard stories about what it was like to be black and a musician in the early 1930s. They are treasures.</p> \n<p>But many of Lead Belly's original recordings no longer exist. The tapes that held his last sessions were beyond saving after the oxide on the top of the record fell off rendering it unplayable. Because conservators couldn't get to them earlier, those songs are lost forever. Let's repeat that — some of these songs, among the most significant in music history, are less than 100 years old but still lost to us for all time.</p> \n<p><b></b>All sound recordings are equally at risk of disintegrating. Before digital technology, record companies created reels for albums by recording different sections of songs, then splicing those sections together using tape. Some of those original tapes are stored in several collections at the Smithsonian Museum.</p> \n<p>""You can only imagine what has happened to these pieces of tapes,"" <a href=""http://www.si.edu/researchstudy/Staffhp/PlaceJ.htm"" style=""line-height: 1.5; background-color: #ffffff;"">Jeff Place</a>, an archivist for the Smithsonian Center for Folklife and Cultural Heritage told me. ""Over time, every one of those tape breaks is going to break, and it's going to take an hour to transfer three minutes of a recording into a digital format where we can store it. So there are albums that take a whole day to save.""</p> \n<p>Place's job is to save sounds by whatever means necessary, so that recordings from 50 years ago sound as clear as they did when they were made — and sometimes even better. This means preserving the original recordings in the best possible condition, and for many albums, it means transferring the sound of the original recording to a digital format that will be easily accessible in the future.</p> \n<p>Without sound archivists, we would not only lose access to early recordings of Elvis and R&amp;B, as albums decayed and technology changed, but we'd also lose radio broadcasts from 50 years ago and oral histories of lost neighborhoods of New York City. Without archivists, we would be losing sound rapidly; instead, we're gaining it.</p> \n<h3>Keeping Up the Classics</h3> \n<p><chorus-asset data-id=""646408"" class=""chorus-snippet browser_wide_media""> <img src=""http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/assets/4675457/bill_haley.jpg"" class=""small"" alt=""bill haley""> </chorus-asset></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Bill Haley, one of the earliest rock 'n roll musicians, performs with his live band. (Getty)</p> \n<p><span>The most important actions for establishing a great library of sound are collection, storage, and preservation. Collection varies by institution. At the Library of Congress, when an album is produced and copyrighted by Sony or Universal or a tiny indie publisher in the United States, a copy enters the library. At the Smithsonian, the museum collects specialty items, like limited-edition vinyl albums and rare recordings. </span></p> \n<p>""We certainly take in digital recordings of contemporary music and upload them to servers. But we are more in a race against time with the older pieces in our collection, so those take up most of our time,"" Matthew Barton, the curator of recorded sound at the Library of Congress, told me.</p> \n<p>Curators try to fill out their collections with sounds from the past they might have missed, and they try to make sure that those sounds stay preserved for future generations to enjoy. That's where storage comes in. To keep the recordings safe, physical copies of sound (like vinyl, cassettes, and CDs) are kept in moisture-controlled and temperature-controlled climates.</p> \n<p>""The thing about archives is we are thinking 50 years from now,"" Place told me. <span>What format — be it vinyl or high quality digital recordings — </span>conservator<span>s decide to save new music in, then, has a lot to do with what kinds of machines they think will be readily available in the future.</span></p> \n<p><span>Vinyl, Place told me, is a prime example of a good medium for </span>conservator<span>s. Keeping vinyl albums playable is easier than cassettes, because turntables are highly abundant. There is no worry that in 30 years, people won't be able to find a way to play an old vinyl album, the way there is with more obscure mediums such as laserdiscs or micro-cassettes.</span></p> \n<p>""LPs don't need much. It's a very stable format, so long as you don't abuse it by exposing it to heat or something like that,"" Barton told me. ""Things like wax cylinders and tape are different stories."" Those are the sounds curators worry about losing.</p> \n<p>Barton told me about a recent situation: a recording by a 1940s bluegrass mandolinist Bill Monroe that was done on a lacquer disc, a form of vinyl popular just before the advent of the cassette tape. One of the problems with lacquer discs is that they start to separate. The recording of the sound on the outer layer will start to peel away from the disc that makes it playable.</p> \n<p>""That was starting to happen with the Monroe disc,"" Barton told me. ""To get it recorded, we had to tack down that one disc using a coin and get a few grooves at a time."" The archivists would then painstakingly move the coin to get the next few grooves, and so on, until the entire disc was preserved.</p> \n<p>But conservation is only part of the job for curators; they also have to try and make these old albums accessible to researchers, which is where the importance of preservation and digitization comes in.</p> \n<h3><span>Finding a digital groove</span></h3> \n<p><chorus-asset data-id=""675842"" class=""chorus-snippet browser_wide_media""> <img src=""http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/675842/cd_sales.0.jpg"" class=""small"" alt=""cd sales""> </chorus-asset></p> \n<p class=""caption"">As mediums fade, archivists have to find a way to keep the industry preserved.  ( Scott Barbour/Getty)</p> \n<p>""Preserving found archives is all about redundancy, so that if something turns out to be a total screw-up, you have it in another form,"" Place said. ""Right now, with digital, we have everything. We can embed metadata in the recording, so then you can go through the system and search. We can add keywords to albums to help researchers, and we can back up our recordings in physical and digital formats.""</p> \n<p><span>Transferring albums to digital formats helps archivists create multiple versions of the same song. On top of preserving music and sound for the future, transferring it to a digital format makes it easier for the public to access and study it. </span></p> \n<p>This has limitations, of course. Libraries cannot make digital music available to stream or use by the public for free without owning the copyright to those items. But the digitization of sound has another benefit as well.</p> \n<p>Archivists can also make old albums <i>sound</i> better in a digital format than they do on a turntable. They will change the width or the geometry of the record player's stylus so that the song plays more clearly and can be recorded at a higher quality.</p> \n<p>""That's a process of the engineer's knowledge and experience. It's very important to know how good an old recording can sound. Even before high fidelity, excellent recordings were being made,"" Barton said. ""In some cases, what we have is better playback than what was available at the time. The turntables we use are much better than anything that was available to users back in the day.""</p> \n<p>Some of the best examples of this work are in the Library of Congress's <a href=""http://www.loc.gov/jukebox/"" style=""line-height: 1.5;"">National Jukebox</a>, an online digitization of over 10,000 historical sound recordings from between 1901 and 1925 that anyone can listen to. ""All of these things were recorded without microphones, and some things recorded better than others,"" Barton said.</p> \n<p>In the National Jukebox, the variance between the recordings shows just how much archivists can do with old sounds. Even the grainiest recordings can be understood, and the best recordings sound almost as clear as any single released today.</p> \n<p>""That whole era of recordings was lost, except to collectors,"" Barton told me. Now, due to proper storage and a team of highly qualified sound engineers, those songs and radio recordings can be downloaded by anyone, anywhere.</p> \n<p>But conservators still worry that what they're doing now might become obsolete in the future. When artists were recording on vinyl, the medium seemed stable and high-quality. No one could have predicted the rise of computers and digital media, yet here we are. Music is being archived today as MP3s and Advanced Audio Coding in the smallest formats available. ""There will be new systems, but there is too much digital info in the world. They will have to be able to be migrated,"" Place told me. T<span>he technologies used to record them are also being archived, in case they are needed later to replay an old file.</span></p> \n<p>Migrating digital content, Place expects, will be easier than trying to migrate physical albums to a digital format. But just in case, Place<span> continues to back up music in physical formats, because there is the fear that a digital drive will fail or get wiped — and all of that music will be lost.</span></p> \n<p>""We're almost always to salvage something from a recording,"" Barton told me. ""In recent years, with the equipment now available to us, we've been able to greatly improve on earlier transfers of historical recordings — one more reason why it is so important to keep them.""</p> \n<p>Conservators are working to recover old albums that they might have missed their first time around — while trying to find the sounds that need to be archived today.</p> \n<p>""We are catching up on many fronts. I'm sure we'll be catching up with so many fronts forever,"" Place said.</p> \n<p>Archivists don't quite have plans in place yet to deal with the amount of digital sound being produced today on the internet. How do you archive YouTube? Or Soundcloud? Or Spotify? A song that seems insignificant today could influence the biggest new band in 20 years, but by then it's possible that those songs could have morphed and disappeared from the internet. Archiving is a constant race against both the past and the future. Here's hoping the preservationists win it.</p>",Music

Kanye has <a href=""http://radio.com/2014/09/18/kanye-west-lorde-collaboration-studio-rumors/"">maybe been in the studio with Lorde</a>. He has definitely been in the studio <a href=""http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/gossip/kim-kardashian-posts-new-photo-kanye-west-north-west-article-1.1891395"">with his baby</a>. An <a href=""http://www.mtv.com/news/1896062/kanye-west-all-day-leak-listen/"">unfinished track of the lead single </a>appeared on the internet.  He has taunted us endlessly. But now, the album is ready. We don't have it yet, but it's ready.</p> \n<p>""I was thinking [the record] could somehow come out in June, like <i>Yeezus</i>, and just kill it for the summer,"" Kanye told GQ earlier this year. ""But then I'm like, I have to work on Adidas and be with my child.""</p> \n<p>Well apparently Adidas and his child didn't require all of the rapper's time because on Wednesday night, Kanye played the full album for some of his friends. Correction, Kanye played the whole album <i>three times </i>for some of his friends, <a href=""http://instagram.com/p/tXQo_8iV1G/?utm_source=partner&amp;utm_medium=embed&amp;utm_campaign=photo&amp;modal=true"">according to rapper Theophilus London</a>.</p> \n<p>Here are some reasons he might have needed to play it 3 times:</p> \n<p><b>1) It was amazing, and his friends demanded it</b></p> \n<p>This is a real possibility. Kanye West is a talented musician, and <i>Yeezus </i>was a great album.</p> \n<p><b>2) Kanye is actually in love with himself</b></p> \n<p>As we know, Kanye is a narcissist. He and Kim Kardashian are blissful in their narcissistic happiness. <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/7/21/5923721/Kanye-West-crazy-quotes-blowfish"">He once even said</a>, ""The concept of Kimye has more cultural significance than Page 6 could even write.""</p> \n<p><span><b>3) People have learned to just let Kanye do whatever he wants</b></span></p> \n<p>""My feelings don't matter anymore,"" <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/7/21/5923721/Kanye-West-crazy-quotes-blowfish"">he told GQ</a>. But they do, Kanye. They do.</p> \n<p><b>4) Kim made him</b></p> \n<p>If Kim Kardashian knows one thing, its how to create buzz and <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/8/4/5956179/how-did-Kim-Kardashian-become-famous"">make a shit ton of money</a>. If she says to play it three times, you play it three times.</p> \n<p><b>5) He insisted it be played until everyone stood up</b></p> \n<p>A few weeks ago, several media outlets reported that West ""<a href=""http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/09/14/kanye-west-stops-concert-to-yell-at-wheelchair-bound-kid-stand-up.html"">demanded</a>"" that handicapped audience members stand up to listen to his music at his concert in Sydney. This turned out not to be true at all, but Kanye does like for people to stand at his concerts. Perhaps this is also true of those who visit him at his home?</p> \n<p><b>6) Kanye still uses a cd player and the repeat function got stuck</b></p> \n<p>Hey. It's possible.</p> \n<p><b>7) He insists you can't really ""get it"" until the third listen.</b></p> \n<p>Kanye is deep in a way that makes many people really confused. His interviews are almost incomprehensible, but his rhymes are perfect.</p> \n<p><b>8) One play per syllable in his name</b></p> \n<p>Kan. Ye. West.</p> \n<p><b>9) It's coming out soon</b></p> \n<p>Because the album was delayed from June, we know that it's mostly done. The label could release the album around the holidays, and this could be a way to build buzz via the Instagram accounts of less well-known rappers. Nah. Probably not. We probably won't see it until early 2015.</p>",Music

Beyonce is a business, and she definitely innovated with the release of her latest album. Ergo, Beyoncé is now a Harvard Business School case study.</p> \n<p><q class=""right"" aria-hidden=""true"">maybe most fascinating is the lengths beyoncé went to to make sure stores got her album second — after the digital release</q></p> \n<p>A new study authored by HBS professors Anita Elberse and Stacie Smith delves into the strategy behind Beyoncé's latest album. There are all sorts of great details to it: the Christmas party at Columbia Records, where she told staffers the night before the release that — by the way — she had an album coming out tomorrow; the (surprisingly) occasional joy of academics taking on R&amp;B (mentioning her ""addictive 'uh-oh' hook,"" for example); and the fact that she's just like us (she gets antsy and distracted when business meetings at Parkwood Entertainment, her company, go longer than an hour).</p> \n<p>But maybe most fascinating is the lengths to which Beyoncé went to make sure the album was a secret. And that meant releasing it online before releasing it in stores —allowing fans to get the music and videos the moment they were released, plus eliminating the possibility a store would leak her music. In 2013, Katy Perry and Eminem both suffered high-profile record leaks, as the study notes.</p> \n<p>And that meant toying with all sorts of labor-intensive ways of releasing physical discs.</p> \n<blockquote style=""margin: 0 0 0 40px; border: none; padding: 0px;""> \n<p>The team had explored an  extensive range of scenarios that would allow them to begin the manufacturing process without  putting the secret at risk. They studied the possibility of manufacturing blank discs in advance,  printing paper packages in advance that looked more like those used for singles, and producing  cardboard slip cases without a track listing or album title. ""Once the album is out, the plan is to  quickly print a black cover with ""Beyoncé"" in pink font which we can just slip over the package,""  said [Jim] Sabey, [head of marketing at Parkwood].</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>But attempting to manufacture them in just 72 hours to get them into stores was a lot of trouble. And the people around Beyonce knew it could backfire. While Beyonce had partnerships with Apple and Facebook for her release, she did not have the backing of major retailers.</p> \n<blockquote style=""margin: 0 0 0 40px; border: none; padding: 0px;""> \n<p>""We know that physical retailers are going to be upset,"" said [Lee Ann] Callahan-Longo, [Parkwood's general manager]. ... <span>Even if some retailers would agree to carry the record, Parkwood anticipated problems in physical  retail. ""Take Walmart, traditionally our biggest partner,"" said Sabey. ""Most of their supply chain and  promotions for December are booked in July. If I said to them tomorrow ‘I want every end-cap  display you have in your music section,’ they’d look at me and be like ‘get out of here.’ They are not  going to be happy no matter what we do."" </span></p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>But of course, we know how this ends: the record broke sales records on iTunes, aside from being a critical smash.</p> \n<p>The upshot of this all is, first of all, that Beyonce gets to release her album how she wants, because she's Queen Bey. And Queen Bey gets to shrug at Target and Walmart if they aren't part of how she wants to do things.</p> \n<p>Which also makes it another example of how big stars get to muscle changes through their industry. Everyone knows physical record sales are declining while digital takes over. <span>Beyonce decided that the benefit of releasing her album digitally (surprise, doing it how she wants) was bigger than the potential cost (losing physical record sales).</span></p> \n<p>Importantly, it's not just Beyonce. Kanye West, Jay-Z, and U2 have all experimented with new ways to release music (with mixed results).

In 2013, she made a surprise appearance on the show before contestant Michelle Chamuel performed ""I Knew You Were Trouble.""</p> \n<p>This is, obviously, a great publicity move. Taylor will appear on <i>The Voice</i> on October 27 (the same day her new album <i>1989</i> drops), October 28, and November 3. Other advisors for this season include Stevie Nicks, Gavin Rossdale, Alicia Keys. But do any of them have a pop album destined for No. 1 in the works? No? I didn't think so.</p>",Music
BeyoncÃ©'s new music video for Flawless proves the elevator fight only made her stronger,http://www.vox.com/2014/10/7/6934791/beyonce-flawless-remix-official-music-video,This is how you turn a scandal into a battle cry.,"<p><span>Like a majestic phoenix soaring through the sky with an American flag on its back and dropping $100 bills in in its wake, Beyoncé has proven that an elevator fight between her sister, Solange, and her husband, Jay-Z, cannot keep her down and will, indeed, only make her stronger. </span></p> \n<p>On Monday, Bey released a video to the ""Flawless"" remix featuring Nicki Minaj. <span>The video, unlike the stuff on her visual album (where the song was first released), isn't high concept.

8 questions about Comic-Con you were too embarrassed to ask,http://www.vox.com/2014/10/9/6949881/san-diego-comic-con,Comic conventions might seem a bit weird to people who have never picked up a comic book or had the spirit move them to dress like Batman. Here's a brief guide to the phenomenon.,"<p>The pop culture phenomenon that is San Diego Comic-Con (SDCC) begins today. Thousands of fans, many dressed up like their favorite comic book heroes and video game characters, will make the pilgrimage to southern California to eat, drink, and breathe everything comics and Hollywood for the next four days.</p> \n<p>This might seem a bit weird to people who have never picked up a comic book or had the spirit move them to dress like Batman. Here, then, is a brief guide to the phenomenon of a comic convention.</p> \n<h3>1) What is a ""comic-con""?</h3> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""2339328"" alt=""Comic Con"" src=""http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2339328/184419521.0.jpg""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">(Photo by Laura Cavanaugh/Getty Images)</p> \n<p>When people talk about a ""comic-con,"" they're usually talking about a comic convention — an event where comics fans, creators, and experts congregate to attend panels, go to parties, and participate in discussions that are all centered on some aspect of comics.</p> \n<p>The first comic convention, according to <a href=""http://www.popmatters.com/feature/95236-the-history-of-comic-conventions/"">Pop Matters</a>, was an event called ""Comiccon '64"" held in New York City in July of 1964. Science fiction conventions started gaining popularity in the <a href=""http://www.fiawol.org.uk/fanstuff/THEN%20Archive/1937conFirst.htm"">1980s</a>. The first San Diego Comic-Con, the most-attended comic convention in the country, was held in <a href=""http://www.comic-con.org/about"">1970</a>.</p> \n<p>In more recent years, these conventions have become more popular, and at some cons, like San Diego Comic-Con, the subject areas have expanded from comics to cover television shows, movies, and other forms of art and fiction that are more mainstream.</p> \n<h3>2) Is there more than one comic-con?</h3> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""2339318"" alt=""Comic Con"" src=""http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2339318/456228740.0.jpg""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">(Getty Images Entertainment)</p> \n<p>Yes. There are comic conventions all around the country, but San Diego Comic-Con trademarked ""Comic-Con"" in <a href=""http://saltlakecomiccon.com/san-diego-comic-con-intl-vs-salt-lake-comic-con/#Trademark"">2005</a> and has threatened legal action against other conventions that use ""Comic-Con"" in their names. Last August, SDCC <a href=""http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/san-diego-comic-con-sues-724403"">sued</a> Salt Lake City Comic Con, claiming that SLCCC had piggybacked on its ""creativity, ingenuity, and hard work,"" and deceived the public about the convention.</p> \n<p><a href=""http://saltlakecomiccon.com/san-diego-comic-con-intl-vs-salt-lake-comic-con/#Trademark"">In response</a>, SLCCC pointed out that there were multiple conventions or ""comic-cons"" that existed before the 2005 trademark.</p> \n<p>The bottom line here is that there are multiple conventions, there are different companies behind each one, and there's a lot of value in them. If there weren't, why would San Diego Comic-Con apply for a trademark?</p> \n<h3><span>3) What's the difference between New York Comic Con and San Diego Comic-Con?</span></h3> \n<p>The main difference between the two, and really what sets San Diego apart from all other comic conventions, is how connected SDCC is to Hollywood and its many marketing teams. SDCC's watershed moment of Hollywood saturation came in<a href=""http://screenrant.com/comic-con-2014-the-avengers-2-cast/""> 2010</a>, when Robert Downey Jr. introduced the cast of <i>The Avengers</i> to assembled fans, two years before the movie even hit theaters. But the convention's pop culture dominance has been growing since the late 2000s, when SDCC began hosting the casts of TV and film properties like <i>Glee</i> and <i>Twilight</i>. Though many of them had nothing to do with comics, they would come to the convention and promote their work, much to fans' delight.</p> \n<p>Even though New York Comic Con has grown more and more popular, it has a lower profile. In terms of scale, the biggest event at New York Comic Con tends to be the annual panel for <i>The Walking Dead</i>, whose cast members pay a visit to the convention every year.<i> </i>But even <i>The Walking Dead</i> is no <i>Avengers</i>.</p> \n<p>This lack of Hollywood hype for New York Comic Con translates to more attention paid to smaller projects and more of a focus on comics news.</p> \n<h3><span>4) How many people attend cons?</span></h3> \n<p>Hundreds of thousands. Here's a look at attendance figures for comic-cons in San Diego, New York, and the up-and-coming Seattle/Emerald City over the years. You'll notice that San Diego has had a sustained 100,000-plus audience since 2006:</p> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""2339282"" alt=""Comic Con"" src=""http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2339282/Screen_Shot_2014-10-09_at_7.18.35_AM.0.png""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">A note on the graph: San Diego Comic-Con reports its attendance as <a href=""http://www.nerdist.com/2014/07/san-diego-comic-con-by-the-numbers/"">""130,000+""</a> while New York Comic Con rounds to the thousands. We plugged in 130,000 as San Diego Comic-Con's numbers. New York Comic Con considers itself the <a href=""http://www.newyorkcomiccon.com/About/NYCC-Fan-FAQs/"">""second-largest comic book and pop culture event in the country.""</a></p> \n<p>There are many reasons why comic conventions have gained so much steam in the last few years, including mainstream pop culture being inundated with comic book projects, more people being interested in comic books, and so on.</p> \n<p>San Diego Comic-Con's constant popularity has probably affected the profile of other conventions, too. In terms of attendance, there are people who can't make it to San Diego year after year, so they instead attend conventions closer to their homes. In terms of business, higher-ups who work on movies or television shows might seek out other conventions like New York's or Emerald City's if those cities are a better fit for the projects they're pushing or if they're backing projects that aren't as huge as <i>The Avengers</i>.</p> \n<h3>5) Do you have to dress up to go to a con?</h3> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""2339320"" alt=""Comic-Con"" src=""http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2339320/452858794.0.jpg""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">(Getty Images Entertainment)</p> \n<p>No. What you're talking about is <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/7/23/5916509/cosplay-explained"">cosplay</a> (<a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/7/23/5916509/cosplay-explained"">costume play</a>). Lots of people attend comic conventions in costume, but it's not a requirement.</p> \n<h3>6) Can a convention ever be too big?</h3> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""2339322"" alt=""Comic Con"" src=""http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2339322/452854330.0.jpg""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">(Chris Frawley/Warner Bros.

These events have capacity limits, and when you get to the big two — New York and San Diego — those limits will be hit, and people will be shut out. Tickets to the bigger cons are a hot commodity, and draw the attention of scalpers who sell the tickets for inflated prices.</p> \n<p>In 2014, New York Comic Con's <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.bleedingcool.com/2015/05/15/nycc-apologises-for-ticket-sales-foul-up-and-that-scalper-tickets-will-be-voided/""></a><a href=""http://www.bleedingcool.com/2014/06/27/new-york-comic-con-sells-out-3-day-passes-as-scalpers-come-to-town/"">passes sold out in minutes</a>. Those passes were resold on sites like eBay and StubHub for higher prices. <span>San Diego Comic-Con regularly sells out in minutes, as well. </span><span>That sucks for fans. </span></p> \n<p>But there's also a cultural dilemma. Because Hollywood has gotten so involved, you might have some diehard <i>Twilight</i> fans show up (as they did in San Diego in 2012) to a convention for one event, while actual comic book fans, ostensibly the people the convention is designed for, get turned away.</p> \n<p>Jim Demonakos, the founder of <a href=""http://emeraldcitycomicon.com/faqs/"">Emerald City Comicon in Seattle</a>, explained to me that what drives Emerald City's con is whether the fans are happy. His rule is that the fan experience dictates capacity.</p> \n<p>""You can grow as big as you want … as long as you're still delivering a good product to your fans,"" <a href=""http://emeraldcitycomicon.com/"">he said</a>. ""So really, what is too big? When you're creating an experience, that is overall negative.""</p> \n<p><span> ECCC has grown exponentially in the past few years and welcomed an estimated 70,000 people in 2014; the event is expecting around 80,000 in 2015.</span></p> \n<h3>7) How did cons get so popular?</h3> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""2339326"" alt=""Comic Con"" src=""http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2339326/452774496.0.jpg""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">(Alberto E. Rodriguez/Getty Images for Disney)</p> \n<p>There are a lot of reasons. Something like the cast of <i>The Avengers</i> appearing is guaranteed to put a lot of butts in seats, and it also puts pressure on other movies and studios to promote themselves at comic conventions.</p> \n<p>But probably the most important factor for the growth of comic conventions is that <a href=""http://www.thewire.com/entertainment/2013/07/how-nerds-lost-comic-con/67304/"">nerd/geek culture has gone mainstream</a>. It isn't just comic book fans who know about the Guardians of the Galaxy now, and it's not just geeks who know about the Dark Knight. Liking comic books or superheroes has become like having a favorite band, and comic conventions are like concerts.</p> \n<p>You also have to consider the marketing that goes into these conventions. People running the events want to make money — at least as much money as they're putting in. And in order to get people to attend, you have to advertise and get the word out. Having big names on a poster (or even simply rumored to possibly appear) helps a lot in that regard.</p> \n<p>""Marketing is the most important job there is when it comes to a public event,"" Ben Penrod, who founded <a href=""http://www.awesome-con.com/"">Awesome Con</a>, told me, explaining that he spends four to five hours per day on marketing. ""That's not to downplay the amount of work that goes into making the event happen, but none of that matters if people don't show up.""</p> \n<h3>8) What's happening at San Diego Comic-Con this year?</h3> \n<p>San Diego Comic-Con is going to have<a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/7/7/8905467/xmen-hungergames-starwars-sdcc-2015""> a different feel this year</a>.

She performed her single ""2 On,"" featuring Schoolboy Q, which <a href=""http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/the-juice/6274224/tinashe-aquarius-track-by-track-review"">peaked at no. 24</a> on the Billboard Hot 100.

The song, titled ""Out of the Woods"" is an anxious, unnerving song about a relationship that is shaky and unclear and tumultuous.</p> \n<p><a href=""http://www.justjared.com/2014/10/13/taylor-swift-out-of-the-woods-full-song-lyrics-listen-now/"">Listen to the song here</a>.</p> \n<p>""Out Of The Woods"" is written and produced by Taylor Swift and Jack Antonoff, of fun. Vocal production by Max Martin for MXM Productions. ""'Out Of The Woods' is one of my favorite songs on 1989,"" Taylor said in <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-M5SW8QvmY"">a promotional video</a> that released Monday. ""A goal of mine on this album was to set a sonic landscape and have the music sound exactly the way the emotions felt.""</p> \n<p>That's what makes ""Out of the Woods"" a song that fits so much more clearly in the Taylor Swift canon than ""Shake it Off,"" the first single from <i>1989</i>, ever did. Where ""Shake it Off"" was clean and pop driven and <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/8/19/6033483/taylor-swift-new-single-shake-it-off-video"">a little too perfect</a>, ""Out of the Woods"" does something we're used to Swift doing — creating songs that destroy their listeners with stories of love and heartbreak and emotion.</p> \n<p>""Out of the Woods"" sounds like ""State of Grace"" did on Swift's 2012 album <i>Red</i>.  The song also delivers on a few earlier Swift promises. When she announced the album on live stream in August, she promised that it was inspired by ""late 80's pop."" That's palpable in ""Out of the Woods."" The backing beats sound like Tears for Fears. The emotional bridge sounds like early Coldplay. In her climbing melodies there are touches of Simple Minds.</p> \n<p>""Looking at it now, it all seems so simple,"" <span>Swift sings at the the beginning of the song, and she's right.

She also accused him of putting her ""life at risk.""</span></p> \n<p>From the courtroom, BuzzFeed News reporter Mary Ann Georgantopoulos <a href=""https://twitter.com/marygeorgant/status/700704825990774784"">tweeted</a> that the judge's first order was to deny Kesha's request to get out of her contract with Dr. Luke's Kemosabe Records label.</p> \n<p>It's the latest wrinkle in the lawsuit, which has been dragging on since October 2014 and getting uglier and more complicated along the way. Here's what to know.</p> \n<h3>Why is Kesha suing her producer?</h3> \n<p>On Tuesday, October 7, 2014, it was revealed <a href=""http://www.tmz.com/2014/10/14/kesha-sexual-assault-dr-luke-abuse-lawsuit-drugs/"">by TMZ</a> that Kesha had filed a civil lawsuit against Dr. Luke. Of all the artists Dr. Luke has produced, his relationship with Kesha is the most involved. At the time she filed the suit, Kesha had nine singles, eight of which were written and co-produced by Dr. Luke.</p> \n<p>The suit begins with Kesha's signing with Dr. Luke at age 18. In it, she claims that he pressured her to drop out of high school, and that while she was in rehab for an eating disorder in 2014, doctors concluded that the ""unrelenting emotional and psychological abuse"" by Dr. Luke caused Kesha to suffer ""severe depression, post-traumatic stress, social isolation, and panic attacks."" Continuing contact with him ""would be 'life threatening.""</p> \n<p>The most incendiary allegations are those of a sexual nature. Here's one example:</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>""In one instance, Kesha claims he forced her to snort something before getting on a plane ... and during the trip he forced himself on her while she was drugged.</p> \n<p>On another occasion, Kesha claims after forcing her to drink with him, Dr. Luke gave her what he called ""sober pills."" Kesha claims she woke up the following afternoon, naked in Dr. Luke's bed, sore, sick ... and with no memory of how she got there.""</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>And this:</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>Kesha also says there was physical abuse ... once she says he attacked her at his Malibu house where he was ""violently thrashing his arms at her."" She says she escaped and ran barefoot down PCH and hid in the mountains.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>The lawsuit also references how Dr. Luke forced Kesha into a contract that was bad for her career and has had the alleged effect of denying her ""any meaningful profit from her work due to Dr. Luke's exploitation of her over the last decade.""</p> \n<p>The lawsuit can be read in full <a href=""http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/read-full-details-keshas-disturbing-740699"">at the Hollywood Reporter</a>.

Dr. Luke continued his successful partnership with Martin, quickly co-writing and producing Avril Lavigne's ""Girlfriend"" and Katy Perry's ""I Kissed a Girl.""  In October 2013, Dr. Luke had two No. 1 songs on the Billboard charts in back-to-back weeks with Katy Perry's ""Roar"" and Miley Cyrus's ""Wrecking Ball.""</p> \n<p>Dr. Luke is known for working with both live instruments and prerecorded samples.

Dr. Luke and Kesha are on the right. (Kevin Winter/Getty)</p> \n<p>Tumultuous, clearly. When Kesha signed to Dr. Luke's label in 2005,<b> </b>he was busy producing several artists' work in the wake of his success on Kelly Clarkson's 2004 <i>Breakaway</i>, and Kesha ended up switching management companies to work with David Sonenberg's company, DAS Communications. The intricacies of her contract with Dr. Luke are unclear, but when DAS tried to sign her to Warner Bros Music in 2008,<a href=""http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/959321/keha-the-billboard-cover-story""> her existing contract with Dr. Luke</a> kept the deal from going through.</p> \n<p>Kesha and Dr. Luke have been in a battle for the future of her career since the beginning. Kesha spent the<a href=""http://www.seventeen.com/fun-stuff/17-buzz/kesha-interview""> first six years</a> of her contract working on her debut album, <i>Animal</i>. She claimed that she wrote <a href=""http://www.seventeen.com/cosmogirl/kesha-interview"">more than 200 songs</a> for the album.  Dr. Luke was the executive producer on <i>Animal</i>, though he was helped by<a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/6/10/5793638/the-geniuses-behind-your-favorite-pop-songs""> Max Martin and Benny Blanc</a><a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/6/10/5793638/the-geniuses-behind-your-favorite-pop-songs"">o</a>. It<i> </i>went platinum, with ""Tik Tok"" selling almost 14 million copies.</p> \n<p>Kesha's 2012 album <i>Warrior</i> was again produced by Dr. Luke and Max Martin, but this time the ante was upped. After the release of the album, Kesha also released an illustrated autobiography and a TV documentary. The lead single, ""Die Young,"" did well, but the second and third singles on the album bombed by Top 40 standards. Kesha's mother, songwriter Pebe Sebert, publicly <a href=""http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20777153,00.html"">blamed Dr. Luke</a>.</p> \n<p>In September 2013, <a href=""http://www.idolator.com/7485711/kesha-fan-petition-free-dr-luke"">a fan-made petition</a> circulated asking for Kesha to be ""freed"" from Dr. Luke. After that, the dominos fell quickly. Kesha claimed <a href=""http://www.tmz.com/2012/12/18/kesha-die-young-lyrics-forced-sing-sandy-point-elementary-school-massacre/"">she was forced to sin</a><a href=""http://www.tmz.com/2012/12/18/kesha-die-young-lyrics-forced-sing-sandy-point-elementary-school-massacre/"">g</a> the single ""Die Young.""  In October, she released another No. 1 single with Pitbull, <a href=""http://open.spotify.com/track/3cHyrEgdyYRjgJKSOiOtcS"">""Timber.""</a> In November, her fans carried a banner to her concert that read, ""Fuck Dr. Luke."" <a href=""http://popdust.com/2013/10/29/kehas-mom-calls-out-dr-luke-on-twitter-says-hes-not-giving-keha-creative-freedom/"">Her mother announced</a> that she blamed Dr. Luke for Kesha's lack of creative inspiration.</p> \n<p>In January 2014, the singer entered rehab for an eating disorder. When she emerged in March, she had dropped the $ from her name.</p> \n<h3>This is sad. Can we take a music break?</h3> \n<p>Yes, of course.

The first picture Kesha's camp is painting is one of a young, terrified artist whose entire career rests in the hands of a producer holding her against her will. The second is of a young girl who was taken advantage of by an older man. <a href=""http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2014/10/the-saddest-thing-about-the-keshadr-luke-lawsuit/381463/"">Both stories are far too common</a>.

Bono is sorry-not-sorry for forcing his album onto everyone's computers,http://www.vox.com/xpress/2014/10/15/6983115/bono-apology-bad,Sunglasses-wearing mega-rockstar Bono apologized Tuesday for thrusting the new U2 album onto the iPhones and computers of every Apple userâ€”approximately half a billion people.,"<p>Sunglasses-wearing mega-rockstar Bono apologized Tuesday for thrusting the new U2 album onto the iPhones and computers of every Apple user—approximately half a billion people.  The new album <i>Songs of Innocence </i>automatically downloaded to every iTunes user's account after the iPhone 6 announcement on September 9, whether they liked it or not.</p> \n<p>In a <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/video.php?v=10153458076501686&amp;set=vb.5678046685&amp;type=2&amp;theater"">Facebook video Q&amp;A</a> on Tuesday, Bono responded to a fan's question that asked ""Can you please never release an album on iTunes that automatically downloads to peoples playlists ever again? It's really rude.""</p> \n<p>To which Bono responded:</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>""Oops...I'm sorry about that. I had this beautiful idea,"" Bono said. ""<span>Artists are prone to that kind of thing. Drop of megalomania, touch of generosity, dash of self promotion and deep fear that these songs that we poured our life into over the last few years might not be heard. There's a lot of noise out there. I guess we got a little noisy ourselves to get through it.""</span></p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>First off, this is a terrible apology. It's really more of an excuse. But let's work through it anyway:</p> \n<p><b>""I had this beautiful idea"" </b></p> \n<p>I also have some beautiful ideas like giving everyone free candy and declaring all Tuesdays national holidays, but I am not a multi-millionaire and bffs with Apple, so no one cares. Just because you have a ""beautiful"" idea doesn't mean it's a ""good idea."" Unlike getting rid of mandatory workplace Tuesdays, which is a great idea.</p> \n<p><b>""Artists are prone to that kind of thing"" </b></p> \n<p>Artists are prone to a lot of things. People are prone to a lot of things. It doesn't mean you can just put whatever you want on everyone's phone.</p> \n<p><b>""Drop of generosity"" </b></p> \n<p>Is this generosity? Because it feels like a whole lot of you forcing something on people that they might not want. An unknown Indie band would almost certainly love to share a drop of generosity with the entire world. Also, Apple paid <a href=""http://www.techtimes.com/articles/15528/20140913/no-pro-bono-apple-spent-100-million-for-free-u2-album.htm"">$100 million dollars </a>for this album, so it's hard to call this alliance one based purely on generosity.</p> \n<p><b>""Dash of self-promotion"" </b></p> \n<p>Just a dash. A teeny tiny dash of self-promotion heralded as the ""largest album release of all time.""</p> \n<p><b>""deep fear that these songs that we poured our life into over the last few years might not be heard""</b></p> \n<p>BONO. Listen to me. You are the frontman of a massive rock band. You have sold millions of albums and won countless awards for your music. It is absurd for you to have this fear, unless you genuinely believe the album is being poorly marketed, in which case you should get a new marketing company! Additionally, <a href=""http://www.ispot.tv/ad/7Cb9/apple-itunes-echoes-featuring-u2"">Apple used one of your songs in a commercial</a>, which is a known way for songs to get popular. You didn't even need to force it on us! The television would have done that anyway!</p> \n<p><b>""There's a lot of noise out there""</b></p> \n<p>This is a fact. Music is a particular thing, and not everyone likes all of it. The stuff we don't like, we dub as noise, which is what happened for a lot of people with <i>Songs of Innocence. </i>Of the 500 million people who got your album,<a style=""background-color: #ffffff;"" href=""http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/6274359/itunes-numbers-u2-songs-innocence-album""> only 26 million</a> of them actually downloaded the whole thing. And a lot of those people probably still don't realize they have it in their iTunes. Be better at apologizing, Bono!</p>",Music
Go for a run this weekend with this playlist,http://www.vox.com/2014/10/18/6993941/running-playlist, ,"<p>The heat has broken in most of the country, and the days are filled with crisp fall air. But it is not winter yet. NOT. WINTER. YET. We are going to <i>cling </i>to these last days of pleasant weather with every fiber of our beings! Get out and enjoy it!</p> \n<p>This playlist is full of upbeat songs that will make it easy to go for a light, fall-weather jog, or a longer run. Running is repetitive, so these are songs to help get into the groove of that. And with 40 minutes of music, this playlist is perfect for those of us just learning to run, as well as the heroes currently training for the fall marathons. Or if you just aren't feeling it (or it's raining), this playlist is also suitable for dancing in one's bedroom.</p> \n<p>But, really, you should get outside. Who knows how much time we have left?</p> \n<p><b>""If I Go"" </b>by Ella Eyre</p> \n<p>Start your run with the rhythmic beats and soulful voice of Ella Eyre, the 20-year-old British songstress. ""Will you love me when I come back?"" you will sing to your past, non-running self.</p> \n<p><b>""Tough Love</b>"" by Jessie Ware</p> \n<p>Jessie Ware's new album, <i>Tough Love,</i> drops October 21, and this is the debut single. It brilliantly showcases Ware's vocal range and ability, and it's catchy bass line will keep you moving.</p> \n<p><b>""Wings"" </b>by Haerts</p> \n<p>Haerts is a Brooklyn indie-pop band with a twinge of German pop inspiration. Haerts's first full-length album drops October 27, making now the perfect time to let the group's harmonies and stop-and-start style sink into your eardrums.</p> \n<p><b>""Lost in My Bedroom"" </b>by Sky Ferreira</p> \n<p>By this point in the run, you're warmed up and ready to go. With her danceable rhythms and electronic background, Sky Ferreira still manages to record a song with a pop-rock rhythm and a guitar solo.</p> \n<p><b>""Timebomb"" </b>by Tove Lo</p> \n<p>The Swedes rule pop music, and Tove Lo's new album, <i>Timebomb,</i> is electro pop at its catchiest and rhymiest. The entire chorus of this song is ""You and I are a time bomb/bomb/bomb/bomb/bomb/ We're not forever. You're not the one. You and I are a timebomb."" It's repetitive, sure, but <i>you will love it</i>. Trust us.</p> \n<p><b>""I Love It"" </b>by Icona Pop featuring Charli XCX</p> \n<p><a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/10/10/6949039/charli-xcx-brunette-fancy"" style=""line-height: 1.5;"">Charli XCX</a> wrote this song for Icona Pop, and it is pure, angry pop, which is to say it's really unhappy but really upbeat. ""I threw your shit into a bag and pushed it down the stairs,"" the singers yell in happy voices! Pretending to be happy while actually being <i>really angry</i>? Sounds like running to us!</p> \n<p><b>""How To Be A Heartbreaker"" </b>by Marina and The Diamonds</p> \n<p>""Rule number one/ is that you gotta have fun/ but baby when you're done/ you gotta be the first to run,"" Marina sings at the beginning of this song. Good job. You're well on your way to being a heartbreaker.</p> \n<p><b>""On Our Way"" </b>by The Royal Concept</p> \n<p>The Royal Concept is the indie-pop version of One Direction. These Swedes create beautiful harmonies, and their debut single was titled ""Damn."" Sounds like a great fit to us.</p> \n<p><b>""Break The Rules"" </b>by Charli XCX</p> \n<p>Here's some more music from <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/10/10/6949039/charli-xcx-brunette-fancy"" style=""line-height: 1.5;"">Charli XCX</a>, one of the biggest up-and-coming pop stars, who drops her new album in December. ""Break the Rules"" is a song with momentum, heavy bass, and a big heaping of teen angst.</p> \n<p><b>""La Belle Epoque"" </b>by Kent</p> \n<p>Does this list really <i>need</i> more Swedish electro pop? Of course it does if it's Kent! This group has a bit more of a rock feel, actually. They also sing in Swedish, but by this point in your run, you will have pushed through all known human barriers and will speak all languages. If not, you can take solace in the fact that Kent is also literally the most popular band in Sweden, having won 20 Swedish Grammys.</p> \n<p><b>""Paper Heart""</b> by Chlöe Howl</p> \n<p>Chlöe Howl is a more pop version of singer-songwriter Laura Marling. Her songs center on romantic relationships and their feelings, which is unsurprising because she's only 19.  She lost the 2014 BRIT Awards: Critics Choice Award to Sam Smith, but not by much, making her a name you should know. This song is great, and so is she.</p> \n<p><b>""Youth</b>"" by Foxes</p> \n<p>Louisa Rose Allen, the voice and face of Foxes, creates a song that is the perfect wind-down tune for this playlist. She is gentle, and subtle with her use of careful drums, and it creates a song with a quiet, beautiful energy. Listen to it while you are passed out on your lawn, trying not to die.</p> \n<p><i>Listen to this week's playlist and follow </i><a href=""http://open.spotify.com/user/voxdotcom/playlist/7mf6PWIyRL6xAMBVDOqnEj"" style=""line-height: 1.5;"">Vox on Spotify</a></p> \n<p><iframe allowtransparency=""true"" frameborder=""0"" height=""380"" width=""300"" src=""https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify:user:voxdotcom:playlist:7mf6PWIyRL6xAMBVDOqnEj""></iframe></p>",Music

How Pandora's data could help artists plan better tours and albums,http://www.vox.com/xpress/2014/10/22/7038465/pandora-amp-artists-data,Pandora knows who listens to Mumford and Sons and who likes Def Leppard,"<p>As the leading internet radio service, Pandora knows which of its 65 million users are listening to a band's music, where they are listening to it, and which songs they like best. Wednesday morning, the company announced that it is going to share that information with bands.</p> \n<p><a href=""ttp://amp.pandora.com"">Pandora AMP</a> will provide all 125,000-plus artists played on the site with data on what their fan base and its preferences, as determined by tens of billions of hours of personalized listening.</p> \n<p>""When I was in a band, we had a rented van, a box of fliers, and a couple staple guns,"" said Tim Westergren, Pandora's founder and a former touring musician, <a href=""http://press.pandora.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=251764&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=1980275"">said in a press release</a>. ""The challenge faced by artists trying to find and build an audience was part of the original inspiration for Pandora. With AMP, the goal is simple: we want to harness the power of our scale and data to make artists' lives easier.""</p> \n<p>Over 80 percent of the artists played on Pandora, the press release says, receive no traditional radio play; in the past, royalties from radio stations have given artists information about who's listening to them. Access to thumbs up/thumbs down data for 50 billion hours of played music could help artists without radio data find out who's listening to them. Among other things, artists will be able to see where their fans are located geographically, letting them book tours more efficiently.</p> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""2379438"" alt=""pandora"" src=""http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2379438/pandora_musicians.0.jpg""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Pandor has launched a new service for artists and managers that provides detailed information about how well their songs perform on Pandora and where their fans are located.</p> \n<p class=""caption"">(<a href=""http://www.latimes.com/business/technology/la-fi-tn-pandora-offers-help-to-musicians-20141021-story.html"">Pandora/LA Times)</a></p> \n<p class=""caption""> </p> \n<p>Ben Singer, manager of singer-songwriter Andy Grammer, said in the press release, ""This is a total game changer for us.

There had been mild overlaps between rock and country since the former began (see also: Johnny Cash), but Brooks tapped into the high-gloss production and sounds of '80s smooth rock. It was huge. His<b> </b>second album,<i style=""line-height: 1.5;""> No Fences,</i> spent 23 weeks at No. 1. His third album, <i>Ropin' the Wind</i>, was the <a style=""line-height: 1.5; background-color: #ffffff;"" href=""http://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/garth-brooks"" target=""_blank"">first ever </a>to enter both the pop and country Billboard charts at No. 1. Brooks proved that country's appeal could extend beyond its traditional audience, as his music videos became mainstays on VH1.</p> \n<p>Swift, too, borrowed from other forms of music to bolster her sound. Her self-titled first album was twangier and far more country than anything she's produced since. But her Grammy-winning second album, <i>Fearless</i>, harnessed the catchy choruses of pop, landing the album in the No 1. spot and winning her a devoted following. <span>For Swift, the twist on country was less about integrating other genres and more about avoiding trends — country or otherwise<i>. </i>She eschewed overproduction and huge bass lines. She didn't belt, as so many other country women did — Carrie Underwood, for example. And her videos were hits, with ""You Belong With Me"" taking home one of MTV's Video Music Awards.</span></p> \n<p>Neither Swift nor Brooks has a great voice. <span>Both are good songwriters, but not necessarily all-time greats.  Both claim to be influenced by James Taylor. (Swift is even named after him.) </span><span> Both have songs that are staples for any country fan, despite the fact that they have been frequently criticized for pandering to pop interests. Brooks' ""Friends in Low Places"" and ""The Thunder Rolls"" are great country songs that easily double as light rock standards. Likewise for Swift's ""Mine"" and ""You Belong With Me,"" which have pop bona fides.</span></p> \n<p>They began their careers as slight outsiders in the country landscape. Although they performed at country music awards shows, they managed to keep their distance at the edges of the genre's landscape. Country music, for both, became a way to find fans and to sell albums — not a way to exclusively define their sounds. They had aspirations that extended far beyond Nashville.</p> \n<h3>Building a constructed front</h3> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""2381284"" alt=""taylor 13"" src=""http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2381284/taylor_13.0.jpg""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Taylor Swift's surprised face. (Michael Loccisano/FilmMagic/Getty)</p> \n<p><span>At its most basic, country music is all about story. Swift and Brooks have their share of angry, sad, and emotional country songs, but the best story that these two managed to tell is the one about themselves. </span></p> \n<p><span>""I wanted to be an artist that the American people could relate to,"" Brooks declared in a </span><a href=""http://www.planetgarth.com/news/article.php?cid=01136"" style=""background-color: #ffffff;"">1994 Playboy interview</a><span>.

In interviews, he often sounds self-deprecatory, which makes him seem more approachable. <span>""I'm just a guy who eats too much, is lazy, and loves to play music,"" Brooks told </span><a style=""background-color: #ffffff;"" href=""http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/09/10/i-m-not-country-or-pop-i-m-just-pure-garth-brooks.html"">the Daily Beast.</a> He is constantly trying to convince everyone that he is just a regular guy, regardless of the millions of albums he has sold and the amount of work that goes into playing 17-song sets night after night.</p> \n<p>The same can be said for Swift, who does her best to look genuinely surprised whenever her name is called at an awards show, despite the fact that she has won pretty much every award a 24-year-old musician can win.</p> \n<p><span>""I'm realistic about the fact that millions of people don't have time in their day to maintain a complex profile of who I am,"" </span><span>Swift </span><a style=""line-height: 1.5; background-color: #ffffff;"" href=""http://www.esquire.com/blogs/culture/taylor-swift-1114"">told Esquire</a><span> in October.

And though her strategy may not be as radio-reliant as Brooks', his goal — to connect ""his voice directly to the listener"" — sounds an awful lot like what Swift is trying to do with her <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.justjared.com/2014/09/22/taylor-swift-invites-fans-to-her-home-for-1989-secret-sessions/""><i>1989</i> secret sessions</a> and <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://taylorswift.com/news/228503"">video monologues </a>before each song.</p> \n<p>Building that bridge with the listener, for Swift, is a way to ensure loyalty. Through her social media presence, Swift does what Brooks did on country radio: she makes them feel special by giving them tracks early and sharing future song lyrics with them. When Taylor Swift steps outside in a shirt that reads ""<a target=""_blank"" href=""http://racked.com/archives/2014/09/25/taylor-swift-t-shirt.php"">No... it's Becky</a>,"" a reference to a popular Tumblr page, she isn't just making a joke.

Instead of seeing Chris Gaines as another Brooks innovation, they saw him as a betrayal.</p> \n<p>""All I know how to do is be myself. That's all I did in the '90s, and that's all I'm doing now.

They scream at his concerts for him. They cry. He's back, he's the Garth fans adore, and no one is complaining. Swift's concerts on the <i>Red</i> tour featured much of the same. Her fans, like Brooks', alternate between screaming praises and standing on tiptoes. She tells personal stories like she's at a slumber party, instead of a 50,000-person arena.</p> \n<p>But Swift has been undergoing a Chris Gaines transition of her own. She has learned to dance (somewhat) and only pulls out the guitar for a few songs. She calls <i style=""line-height: 1.5;"">1989 </i>her first official pop album, but Swift's transition has been more subtle, and she didn't create an alter ego to do it. She made a slow, careful transition that made her evolution seem inevitable. For instance, her last release, <i>Red, </i>especially on songs like ""22"" and ""We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together,"" sounds like a pop album. Hell, it <i>is</i> a pop album. But Taylor didn't brand it that way, and so she was still welcomed into the country-music fold.</p> \n<p><span>Because she was younger than Brooks when he tried to become Chris Gaines — or maybe because she's more calculated or because it's a different time — Swift is making the pop star transition better than Brooks ever could.

But she also looked like a more-refined, more-polished, and more-talented star than she ever has. And there's the difference. When Brooks became Chris Gaines, he shed his identity.

Taylor Swift's new album 1989 has leaked,http://www.vox.com/xpress/2014/10/24/7061625/taylor-swift-1989-leaked-album-leak,This is why we can't have nice things,"<p>After months of perfect secrecy and rumors that Taylor Swift was only allowing people to listen to her new album <i>1989</i> on her personal iPhone,<i> </i>the entire album has leaked just days before it is scheduled Monday release date. ""Loose lips sink ships all the damn time,"" as Taylor sings on ""I Know Places.""</p> \n<p><img src=""http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2388706/Taylor_Swift_-_1989.0.png"" alt=""1989 album cover"" data-chorus-asset-id=""2388706""></p> \n<p>Of course, downloading the leaked album is probably illegal and we would never suggest you do that.</p> \n<p>This leak won't matter, though, for Swift's success. 2012's<span> </span><i style=""line-height: 1.5;"">Red </i><span>sold 1.23 million</span><span> copies</span><span> </span><span>in the first week, and it also leaked in full.

Yet, both <i>Red</i> and <i>Speak </i>now went instant-million</span><span>, and</span><span> </span><i style=""line-height: 1.5;"">1989 </i><span>will probably be do the same. Basically, Taylor Swift bigger than the leaks.</span></p> \n<p>The more meaningful question is whether <i>1989 </i>is actually any good.</p> \n<p>Taylor wasn't kidding when she called this her ""first official pop <span>album</span>."" <i style=""line-height: 1.5;"">Red </i>sounds like music that could be played at a honky-tonk after listening to the pure pop of <i style=""line-height: 1.5;"">1989. </i>These songs sound as expensive as Taylor's clothing looks. It is expertly produced and perfectly mixed. Swift's voice isn't the best in the industry, but it sounds the best it has ever sounded.</p> \n<p><i>1989</i> is upbeat and fast all the way through. There was some worry—<a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/8/19/6033483/taylor-swift-new-single-shake-it-off-video"">myself included</a>— that, despite Swift's success with songs like ""22"" and ""We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together,"" she would lose her ability to write heartfelt, personal songs when adopting the rhythms and clean sounds of pop music. On <i>1989</i>, Swift demolishes those fears. This is an album of love songs with a twist such as on ""Black Space"" where Swift coos, ""Baby I'm a nightmare/Dressed like a dream/I've got a blank space baby/ (pen click sound)/ I'll write your name.""</p> \n<p>But it's also an album with the break-up references her fans love. There's the already<b> </b>released ""<a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/10/14/6973965/taylor-swift-out-of-the-woods-heart"">Out of the Woods</a>"" that won over Swift fans quickly. But Swift's angry tone on this record is sharper than we've heard it before.  ""Cause baby now we got bad blood/ you know we used to be mad love/ so take a look what you've done/ cause baby now we got bad blood/ Now we got problems/ And I don't think we can solve them"" Swift chants on ""Bad Blood."" It's upbeat, sure, but instead of the mournful, slow-building rage of ""All to Well,"" Swift lets herself get mad on <i>1989, a</i>nd it works. She sounds powerful and strong instead of brooding.</p> \n<p>""All You Had to Do Was Stay"" has all of the great lyrical qualities of <i>Red</i>. ""This Love"" is a classic Taylor Swift ballad. There are a couple of missteps here—notably the album's first single ""Shake it Off—but they are few and far between.</p> \n<p>Abandoning country music seemed like a huge risk to take for such a successful artist, but after listening to <i>1989 </i>it's obvious that there was no risk here for Taylor Swift at all.</p> \n<div><br></div> \n<div><span><br></span></div>",Music

Ghosts are forever, even if Halloween is not, and it <i>is</i> All Saints' Day — to say nothing of the ongoing Day of the Dead celebrations throughout the world.</p> \n<p>Musicians, like many artists, love ghosts and ghost imagery. These are all songs that have ghosts in their titles, but they have varied sounds. Some are slow ghost songs with deep melodies, and some are groovy ghost songs.</p> \n<p>Here's a playlist to celebrate the chilly air and creeping Daylight Savings shadows:</p> \n<p><b>""Ghost Sound Effects 3</b>"" by Various Artists</p> \n<p>Despite not being an actual, y'know, song, this is a good, creepy intro to this wonderful ghosty playlist. Ghosts sound like shrieks and whispers and the wind outside your window. Luckily, there is real music to come that will drown them out.</p> \n<p><b>""Ghosts"" </b>by Laura Marling</p> \n<p>We start the real playlist a little more gently with the quick, melodic lyrics of British singer-songwriter Laura Marling. ""These are just ghosts that broke my heart before I met you,"" Marling croons. Are all past lovers ghosts? Maybe.</p> \n<p><b style=""font-size: 15.4545450210571px; line-height: 1.5;"">""Is There A Ghost"" </b><span>by Band of Horses</span></p> \n<p>Six-piece rock group Band of Horses relocated to South Carolina before releasing <i>Cease to Begin,</i> the album that ""Is There a Ghost"" appears on. Perhaps because of that, the song has a Southern tinge in an otherwise full-bodied rock song, featuring the lyric, ""When I lived alone, is there a ghost in my house.""</p> \n<p><b>""Ghost"" </b>by Sir Sly</p> \n<p>Landon Jacobs, the man at the front of indie-rock band Sir Sly, has a surging, emotional voice. The backing snyth-pop sounds in ""Ghost"" create a moody aura. When Jacobs take his voice up an octave in the last minute to sing, ""You're a ghost,"" the lyric becomes a haunting rising chant that's both mesmerizing and catchy.</p> \n<p><b>""Ghost to Me"" </b>by Youth Lagoon</p> \n<p>""Ghost to Me"" is a bonus track off of Youth Lagoon's debut album <i>The Year of Hibernation</i>. On it, Trevor Powers uses the minimalism of piano and synthesizers to create a song about mental instability and the struggle of lost love.</p> \n<p><b>""Ghosts"" </b>by On An On</p> \n<p>On an On is an indie-rock trio made up of the remaining members of the band Scattered Trees after it broke up. On An On, as exhibited on ""Ghost,"" is a stronger band musically speaking. Alissa Ricci, in particular, really shines on keyboard and back-up vocals, even tossing in some ghosty ""ooOoooOOooh"" noises.</p> \n<p><b>""The Ghost of Rockschool"" </b>by Belle and Sebastian</p> \n<p>Legendary indie-rock band Belle and Sebastian shows how ghost songs are made into beautiful, soothing, horn-driven anthems with ""The Ghost of Rockschool."" The harmonies in the second half of the song warm up the sad lyrics.</p> \n<p><b>""Walking With a Ghost""</b> by Tegan And Sara</p> \n<p>""Walking with a Ghost"" only has eight lines of lyrics, yet it's probably one of the most popular indie-rock ghost songs. It makes sense, though. Ghosts are pretty repetitive creatures, always moving your stuff around and making the same bloodcurdling noises. Must get annoying!</p> \n<p><b style=""font-size: 15.4545450210571px; line-height: 1.5;"">""The Ghost Inside"" </b><span>by Broken Bells</span></p> \n<p>James Mercer's high whimsical voice is perfect for this ghostly tune where he sings about a girl who lost herself to a man. ""Did it all/ For that dollar/ She's a star tonight/ Without warning/ She gave up, the ghost inside.""</p> \n<p><b>""Ghost Dream"" </b>by Blouse</p> \n<p>Blouse's self-titled first album combines elements of 1980s modern rock with electronic keyboard backing. ""Ghost Dream"" sounds like just that — mesmerizing and sleepy and a little bit creepy.</p> \n<p><b>""Ghost"" </b>by Neutral Milk Hotel</p> \n<p>Jeff Mangum's iconic, twangy voice shines on Neutral Milk Hotel's ""Ghost,"" where he sings ""Ghost, ghost, I know you were within me, feel you as you fly/In thunder clouds above the city, into one that I loved""</p> \n<p><b>""Ghost"" </b>by Sky Ferreira</p> \n<p>Sky Ferreira's songs tend to be upbeat, but on ""Ghost"" she's dealing with some melancholy, and her voice sounds all the better because of it. Instead of a real ghost, though, Ferreira sings here about the ghost of a once happy relationship.</p> \n<p><b>""Bruised Ghosts"" </b>by Amy Milan</p> \n<p>""<span>Ghosts weren't meant for bleeding/ </span><span>Ghosts weren't meant for bleeding,"" Amy Milan sings over a gentle guitar and horn backing.

The weird legal reason many of your favorite shows arenâ€™t on DVD,http://www.vox.com/2014/11/3/7145231/shows-not-on-dvd-music-rights-wonder-years-wkrp,Would you believe pop music holds up many of these releases? Here's how.,"<p>In late 2014, both <a href=""https://timelife.com/products/the-wonder-years-complete-series"" target=""_blank""><i>The Wonder Years</i></a> and <a href=""https://www.shoutfactory.com/tv/comedy/wkrp-in-cincinnati-the-complete-series"" target=""_blank""><i>WKRP in Cincinnati</i></a> finally came out on complete series DVD sets. The latter had seen its first season come out in a <a href=""http://zvbxrpl.blogspot.com/2007/03/wkrp-dvd-not-ok.html"" target=""_blank"">hideously butchered version</a> in 2007, while the former had never been on DVD. And to a lot of TV fans, the release of both was both cause for celebration — and a bit of a miracle.</p> \n<p><i>Wonder Years</i> and <i>WKRP</i> are among the best TV comedies ever made, but it was long believed to be impossible for either to come out on DVD intact. The reason is simple: both shows made ample use of pop music, occasionally just playing in the background of scenes and often to underscore hugely important moments.</p> \n<p>As the physical media era comes to a close, the number of companies willing to pay the hefty fees necessary to close out music licensing deals has pretty much dwindled to two — StarVista, which released <i>Wonder Years</i>, and Shout! Factory, which released <i>WKRP</i>. Not coincidentally, both companies have longstanding relationships with record companies that make closing deals for individual songs easier to accomplish.</p> \n<p>But music licensing is also vitally important to the new streaming era — as anyone who watched <i>The Wonder Years</i> during its brief sojourn on Netflix and heard the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2_2SPFs5Hc"" target=""_blank"">terrible, non-Joe Cocker version</a> of the show's famous theme song can attest. It's by far the biggest problem in getting old TV shows (and some old movies) into the hands of the public, and it all stems from US copyright law that were largely designed for a world where TV episodes would only be consumed a handful of times, copyright law that allows greedy rights holders to have an outsize impact on these sorts of negotiations.</p> \n<p>Indeed, if you're a fan of classic TV, then music licensing is one of the most important things you can understand, if you want to know why so many great shows seem to be disappearing down the cultural memory hole.</p> \n<h3>What is music licensing?</h3> \n<p>Any time you hear a pop song (or other piece of pre-recorded music) in a movie or TV show, someone has paid licensing fees to get that song in their film or series. Licensing fees are paid in two separate ways. The first fee is paid to the songwriter, and it goes to the publishing company that controls the rights to those songs. The second fee is paid to use the actual recording, and it goes to a record company.</p> \n<p>For most modern shows, these negotiations include all possible uses of the song — initial broadcast, reruns, syndication, DVDs, international, and online streaming. (This isn't always the case. NBC's <i>Parenthood</i>, for instance, has <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DU6fg8l2p5w"" target=""_blank"">a different theme song</a> on DVD than Bob Dylan's ""Forever Young,"" which is what is used on TV.) The problems usually come from older programs, which were produced in eras when it was thought that TV shows were unlikely to ever come to home video, because there were so many episodes per season.</p> \n<p>This means that some older TV shows used incredibly expensive music no one could get the rights to today, simply because no one thought anyone in 2014 would want to watch the show in the comfort of their own homes. <i>WKRP</i>'s most famous episode, ""Turkeys Away,"" for instance, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1enfo8zn3_g"" target=""_blank"">uses the song ""Dogs"" by Pink Floyd</a> in one of its biggest scenes. However, the song has been removed from Shout's release of the show, because it's impossible to get Pink Floyd music for a DVD release nowadays.</p> \n<div style=""text-align:center""> \n<p><iframe frameborder=""0"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/ieQaJTcEj74"" height=""315"" width=""560""></iframe></p> \n</div> \n<h3>Why were bands more willing to release rights in the ‘70s and '80s than they are now?</h3> \n<p>For the most part, the contracts that were being signed then were for a handful of airings on broadcast, then some sort of time window in syndication. (<i>WKRP</i>, in fact, was <a href=""http://www.againstmonopoly.org/index.php?perm=886089000000001005"" target=""_blank"">heavily re-edited in the ‘90s</a> to remove songs that the program had lost the rights to.) This was easier to deal with than the thought of someone owning the episodes on DVD and having access to the music in perpetuity.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""left"">Both StarVista and Shout cleared over 90 percent of the music in Wonder Years and WKRP, respectively.</q></p> \n<p>US copyright law is Byzantine and strange, but it <i>does</i> usually protect artists in situations like this, and this sort of ancillary use of a song was a good way for an artist to make a little extra cash without diluting the overall value of their product — particularly if the show was as good as <i>WKRP</i> and <i>Wonder Years</i> were. Where that copyright law often causes problems is when it treats snippets or samples of works like the entirety of the work, or when it deals with older songs. Copyright, which once expired after a little over half a century, now effectively could be extended until eternity by rights holders.</p> \n<p>Yet despite these hurdles, both StarVista and Shout cleared over 90 percent of the music in <i>Wonder Years</i> and <i>WKRP</i>, respectively. There are occasional scenes where diehard fans might miss a song, but for the most part, these are as good of DVD versions as are possible of these music-heavy shows. Just how did they do it?

But the nice thing about having that list is that once it's pulled together, the companies can begin chipping away at it in order of prominence, slowly filling in the gaps as they go along.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""center"">""If we can tell people that Bob Dylan has 10 songs in Wonder Years, and he agreed to be involved, that's impressive.""</q></p> \n<p>For <i>The Wonder Years</i>, Jeff Peisch, the Senior Vice President of Entertainment Programming and Marketing at StarVista, who spearheaded the music clearances for both <i>The Wonder Years</i> and <a href=""https://timelife.com/products/china-beach-the-complete-series"" target=""_blank"">last year's <i>China Beach</i> set</a>, told me, the first goal was to land the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Ob59hsRaFU"" target=""_blank"">Joe Cocker version of ""With a Little Help from My Friends""</a> that opens every episode. Without that, Peisch said, the show probably wasn't worth doing.</p> \n<p>From there, Peisch and his team moved on to the publishing office of Bob Dylan, who had 10 different songs scattered throughout the series in various forms. They had anticipated a struggle to get Dylan's music on DVD, but the process went surprisingly smoothly. And that helped the company approach other artists. ""If we can tell people that Bob Dylan has 10 songs in <i>Wonder Years,</i> and he agreed to be involved, that's impressive,"" he said.</p> \n<p>But getting an immediate ""yes"" or ""no"" is often unlikely, and the clearance process can drag on for weeks or even months, until a company gets an answer. These cases sometimes require going to the artists themselves, making a case, and hoping for the best. But even that sometimes doesn't work.</p> \n<p>Collecting music clearances, then, is a slow battle to check off more and more boxes, filling in more and more gaps.</p> \n<h3>When do problems arise?</h3> \n<p>Both StarVista (Time Life) and Shout (Rhino Records) have close ties to companies with long-standing record company relationships. That puts both companies at a significant advantage when it comes to making deals to lock down songs for inclusion on DVD.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""right"">""They're small publishers, where they only control a few things.""</q></p> \n<p>Often, however, the problems come from dealing with the individual publishing houses, which can drive much harder bargains, because there are so many more to deal with. By and large, the actual rights to the recordings will be held by one of the four major record companies, while there are hundreds upon hundreds of individual publishing houses.</p> \n<p>""In some cases, they're small publishers where they only control a few things,"" Garson Foos, the president of Shout! Factory, told me. And in those cases, the publishers will often drive harder bargains that can drive up the price of not just the songs they control, but the songs controlled by larger publishing houses as well.</p> \n<p>Oftentimes, larger publishers will request a ""favored nations"" rate, which means that they receive the same price per song as a smaller publisher who negotiates a sweetheart deal, though a company like Shout can sometimes get exceptions made for artists that are notoriously tricky to lock down. (The Beatles were the band Foos immediately mentioned in this regard.)</p> \n<p>""You plead with those people that have a couple of songs to go with the rates that the vast majority of people are willing to go with and hope they'll come along, but once in a while they just won't,"" said Foos.</p> \n<p>And that's when it's time to decide whether to pay the higher rate — and potentially push the cost of the whole project up by thousands of dollars — or find another solution.</p> \n<h3>So what if a publisher won't deal? What then?</h3> \n<p>In this case, a company has a handful of options. It can try to excise the music entirely. If the problem is on the recording end, rather than the publishing end, it can try to find a cover version. It can try to find a song that has the same mood or vibe. Or it can fill with original score.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""left"">Companies have to figure out new cues that will allow for the same feel of the original scene</q></p> \n<p>For <i>Wonder Years</i>, Peisch came across a Blood, Sweat, and Tears song StarVista simply couldn't clear on the recording level. However, the publishing rights were available — and it just so happened the lead singer of the band, David Clayton Thomas, had recorded his own version of the song the company <i>could</i> get the rights to.</p> \n<p>""You'd have to listen really, really carefully to be able to tell the difference between the two recordings,"" Peisch told me.</p> \n<p>Mostly, though, these companies have to figure out new cues that will allow for the same feel of the original scene, without calling attention to themselves in disruptive fashion. And that, in and of itself, is a bit of an art.</p> \n<p>""It's very cue by cue, and a lot of thought goes into it,"" Foos told me.</p> \n<h3>What are some of the other problems with music in older shows?</h3> \n<div class=""align-left""> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""2417358"" alt=""WKRP"" src=""http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2417358/turkeyscouldfly.0.jpg""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">The famous ""Turkeys Away"" episode of WKRP in Cincinnati is finally on DVD in (mostly) intact form. (Sony Pictures Television)</p> \n</div> \n<p>In the case of <i>WKRP</i>, especially, the music often wasn't available on a separate track from the dialogue on the program's soundtrack. (Most modern programs include the music and dialogue on separate tracks, allowing for either to be replaced with ease. <i>WKRP</i> was filmed on videotape, which has very little flexibility in this regard.) In situations like this, if a clearance couldn't be found, Shout had to go through and digitally remove the problematic music, scene by scene, cue by cue. It was painstaking work, even with modern technology.</p> \n<p>""The technology has gotten better and better, so there are things that you can do, but it's very exacting work,"" Foos told me.</p> \n<p>Peisch pointed to StarVista's frequent release of old variety shows, like <i>The Carol Burnett Show</i> or <i>The Dean Martin Show</i>, where performances can often be hard to clear because they're being performed live, rather than as background music. In these cases, however, the company is able to simply look for other episodes with music that will be easier to clear, as StarVista doesn't release either program in complete season or series sets but, rather, in ""best of"" compendiums.</p> \n<div style=""text-align:center""> \n<p><iframe frameborder=""0"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/ZGr2UJLaTKE"" height=""315"" width=""420""></iframe></p> \n</div> \n<h3>Are there ways the law could be different to fix this problem?</h3> \n<p>Both Peisch and Foos are quick to say that artists who have their music used in a movie or TV show should be compensated for their work. But they're also willing to point out that the way music clearances work in Europe allows for many programs to come out on DVD there that may never come out here.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""center"">Shout spent ""Toward a million"" to clear music from WKRP</q></p> \n<p>In Europe, rather than negotiating clearances on a case-by-case basis, a DVD company will divide up a certain percentage of the profits of every DVD sold among the various artists who have songs in the show. It works as something much closer to the compulsory rate publishers get for sale of recorded music, which generates an automatic royalty to the songwriter.</p> \n<p>Foos says that though Shout occasionally interests some publishers or record labels in this idea, it has yet to really find a way to push it through. There's just too much money involved for publishers and record labels in the current system. (Indeed, he told me Shout spent ""toward a million"" to clear music for <i>WKRP</i>.)</p> \n<p>Foos also suggested perhaps there could be different rates for songs that are simply used in the backgrounds of scenes, as opposed to songs that are used in full or as performances by the original artists. It's possible such a change could be made by expanding the definition of ""fair use"" under existing copyright law, though such a thing is unlikely to happen, due to (again) the amount of money potentially involved.</p> \n<div style=""text-align:center""> \n<p><img src=""http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2417364/Arnold_Family.0.jpg"" alt=""Wonder Years"" data-chorus-asset-id=""2417364""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">The Arnold Family was at the center of The Wonder Years, a show many thought would never be on DVD. (StarVista)</p> \n</div> \n<h3>What are some other series being held up by music rights issues?</h3> \n<p>Every TV fan has one show or another that was released on DVD in the early days of TV on DVD sets, only to have its music cues completely changed or destroyed. The wonderful, quirky drama <i>Northern Exposure</i>, for instance, had one of the great TV soundtracks of all time — but you wouldn't know it to watch the DVDs, which replace much of the music with annoying but cheaper tunes.</p> \n<p>Foos says that one show Shout has looked at releasing that has lots and lots of music (including a theme song by the Foo Fighters) is the four-season small-town dramedy <i>Ed</i>, which gave actors Tom Cavanagh and Julie Bowen their starts, and is currently languishing in a kind of TV purgatory, where nobody ever gets to see it. He also mentioned that <i>Malcolm in the Middle</i> is unlikely to be released on DVD in its entirety because of music rights issues.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""right"">""It may get to a point where the market potential becomes too small to make it worth it.""</q></p> \n<p>Music clearances have been less of a problem for movies, because the rise of wall-to-wall pop music in movies roughly coincided with the rise of the home-video market. But there are still occasional issues. Foos cited <i>Looking for Mr. Goodbar</i>, for instance, a seminal 1977 film about a woman (played by Diane Keaton) dealing with the sexual revolution, as a movie that may not be on DVD yet because it features so much pop music (playing in the background of its many scenes set in singles bars). Another could be <i>American Hot Wax</i>, a biopic about DJ Alan Freed, which uses tons of early rock ‘n' roll recordings.</p> \n<p>But though companies like Shout and StarVista are doing their best to close these gaps so fans of these programs can have physical copies that aren't subject to the whims of streaming rights holders (and summarily yanked on and off of Netflix), time is running out. Physical media is on the downswing.</p> \n<p>""Fortunately, we're still doing well selling DVDs, but there's no doubt it's a decreasing market, and it may get to a point where the market potential becomes too small to make it worth it, even if the [music licensing] rates were reasonable,"" Foos said.</p>",Music

BeyoncÃ© is releasing a platinum edition of her surprise album,http://www.vox.com/2014/11/4/7154221/beyonce-new-album-platinum-edition-secret,BeyoncÃ© Knowles Carter is maybe the only artist from whom two new songs and a four disc box set can be a disappointment.,"<p>Beyoncé Knowles Carter is maybe the only artist from whom two new songs and a four disc box set can be a disappointment.</p> \n<p>After weekend rumors of a new Beyoncé album swirled, the singer announced<span> a p</span><span>latinum edition</span><span> box set with re-releases of her old songs</span><span> and two bonus tracks. <i>Beyoncé Platinum Edition </i>is a four disc set that includes the original music videos and a concert performance, but it wasn't the full new surprise drop that fans wanted. Here's how fans were able to believe the rumor of a new album even with very little evidence: </span></p> \n<p>Last winter in the middle of the night, Beyoncé broke the law of pop star album releases when she offered up her self-titled album into the world with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/53337-beyonce-releases-self-titled-visual-album/"" target=""_blank"">no warning and zero publicity</a>. Suddenly, <i>Beyoncé</i> appeared in iTunes with a music video for every song. There was no publicity tour beforehand and no regimented build up. By doing what she wanted, Beyoncé taught her audience not to trust her.</p> \n<p>After that surprise, fans watch Beyoncé with a constant critical eye. If the woman could create a whole album and 17 videos without news leaking, what else could she do?</p> \n<p>It's her past disruption of the status quo that made the rumors on Saturday all the more believable. A track list leaked from an unaffiliated Twitter account with an image that appeared to be a record company release for an upcoming album confirmation.</p> \n<blockquote lang=""en"" class=""twitter-tweet""> \n<p>BEYONCÉ platinum edition track list. <a href=""http://t.co/KmlDjWDllg"">pic.twitter.com/KmlDjWDllg</a></p> \n— Beysus † Godga (@GagaLovesBey) <a href=""https://twitter.com/GagaLovesBey/status/528648841885544448"">November 1, 2014</a>\n</blockquote> \n<p> \n<script charset=""utf-8"" src=""//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js""></script> \n</p> \n<p>The track list featured in the image included 11 new songs, and the list seemed to be validated when people found that two of the song titles were registered <span>under Beyoncé's name</span><span> with</span><span> </span><span>ASCAP, the organization that dictates copyrights for songs. </span><span>Fans itched in anticipation and rumors swirled.</span><span> It was </span><span>believable</span><span> enough for fans to pay attention, and they were on high alert when, on Monday, a Beyoncé album appeared for purchase on Amazon UK.</span></p> \n<p> </p> \n<p>But Beyoncé — not fans and certainly not rumors — controls her image carefully.</p> \n<p> </p> \n<p>The package will include two CDs including one titled <i>More </i>that has two new songs, ""7/11"" and ""Ring Off,"" as well as remixes from the album released last December. There will also be two DVDs in the set: one with the music videos that accompanied the album drop, and one with a performance video from the Mrs. Carter Show World Tour. The set also includes a Beyoncé mini calendar for 2015, and is currently available for <a style=""font-size: 15.4545450210571px; line-height: 20.4545440673828px; background-color: #ffffff;"" target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00O87J9NU/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=B00O87J9NU&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=b0868-21&amp;linkId=OOGHPTUTBFG52E2P"">pre-sale on Amazon </a><span>in Canada and the UK.</span> \n</p>\n<p> </p> \n<p>After the announcement from Beyoncé, the user who posted the tracklist in the first place, admitted it all was a scam:</p> \n<blockquote class=""twitter-tweet"" lang=""en""> \n<p>The media is believing the fake BEYONCÉ platinum edition track list I posted</p> \n— Beysus † Godga (@GagaLovesBey) <a href=""https://twitter.com/GagaLovesBey/status/529166116434624512"">November 3, 2014</a>\n</blockquote> \n<p><span>However, the tweeted tracklist did include the two songs registered under Beyoncé's name with ASCAP, ""DONK"" and ""Cherry."" That means that Beyoncé could release those songs at any time, maybe on this album or maybe some time in the future. It's still possible t</span><span>he announcement of the platinum edition could be a diversion tactic to keep attention away from the Beyhive while they plan another midnight drop. </span></p> \n<p>In all likelihood, <span>Beyoncé hasn't created another full album in a single year while she has been on tour. </span><span>But what's amazing about the platinum edition is that it showed how powerful Beyoncé is as a business woman. She can generate a massive amount of buzz over what is essentially a collector's edition of songs that fans already bought last December. Because fans don't trust her to play by the rules, it is easy to entertain the idea that the box set could contain a whole new album, and people will buy it to find out. Beyoncé is sneaky, but she's also brilliant. </span></p> \n",Music

"Taylor Swift isn't on Spotify anymore, but here's a playlist of replacement jams",http://www.vox.com/2014/11/8/7175585/taylor-swift-isnt-on-spotify-anymore-but-heres-a-playlist-of,Taylor Swift pulled all of her songs from streaming services this week. Survive the weekend with these songs,"<p>Taylor Swift pulled all of her songs from streaming services this week, telling Yahoo! she did it because ""the landscape of the music industry itself is changing so quickly that everything new, like Spotify, all feels to me a bit like a grand experiment. I'm not willing to contribute my life's work to an experiment that I don't feel fairly compensates the writers, producers, artists, and creators of this music. And I just don't agree with perpetuating the perception that music has no value and should be free.""</p> \n<p>Swift is probably wrong about streaming's future in the industry, but that doesn't make it any less difficult to survive in a Swiftless streaming wasteland without her.</p> \n<p>Here's a playlist with one song that sounds like every song on Taylor Swift's new album, <i>1989, </i>just in case you felt the need for a crude facsimile of America's number one album. This playlist also might give you an idea of just how comfortably former country artist Swift now fits into the world of pop, as there are a lot of big stars and hit songs on here.</p> \n<p><b>""Hang with Me"" </b>by Robyn</p> \n<p><i>1989</i> kicks off with the excessively poppy, dreamy ""Welcome to New York."" Robyn's ""Hang with Me"" has the same thumping bass and rising bridge.</p> \n<p><b>""400 Lux"" </b>by Lorde</p> \n<p>Swift's bestie and Grammy Award winner Lorde is a good holdover for <span>Swift's angsty </span><span>""Blank Space."" Plus, ""400 Lux"" has a great groove to get you ready for the rest of this playlist and your Taylor-less life.</span></p> \n<p><b>""Lose Yourself to Dance"" </b>by Daft Punk (featuring Pharrell Williams)</p> \n<p>Daft Punk doesn't seem like an easy match for Swift's pop sensibilities, but ""Lose Yourself to Dance"" has the same grooving guitar that works so well on her ""Style."" Plus, Pharrell Williams's voice is crooning and perfect on this track.</p> \n<p><b>""Rollercoaster</b>"" by Bleachers</p> \n<p>If you love an emotional build that you could run a marathon to it, as featured ""Out of the Woods,"" ""Rollercoaster"" is a great replacement song to get you through this trying time.</p> \n<p><b>""Call Me Maybe"" </b> by Carly Rae Jepsen</p> \n<p>""Call Me Maybe"" is catchy bubblegum pop that uses the absolute height of Jepsen's vocal range to give the song depth. Swift does the same thing on ""All You Had to Do Was Stay.""</p> \n<p><b>""Happy"" </b> by Pharrell Williams</p> \n<p><span>No song is quiet as carefree and happy as Pharrell Williams's ""Happy."" </span><span>It feels like the song that ""Shake it Off"" is trying to be under its thin veil of anger</span></p> \n<p><b>""Falling"" </b>by Haim</p> \n<p>Despite the intros to both of these songs sounding incredibly similar, the lyrical quality of Swift's ""Wish You Would"" is just as demanding, snarky, and great as Haim's ""Falling.""</p> \n<p><b>""E.T."" </b>by Katy Perry (feat. Kanye West)</p> \n<p>Not only is Swift's ""Bad Blood"" rumored to be about Katy Perry, but it also sounds an awful lot like Perry's ""E.T."" Listen to ""You're/so/hypnotizing,"" and tell us it doesn't sound like ""did you/have to/do this."" You can't deny it! (<i>Returns to marking up entire kitchen wall with yarn to expose hidden connections between Perry and Swift.</i>)</p> \n<p><b>""Young and Beautiful"" </b>by Lana Del Rey</p> \n<p>The second half of <i>1989</i> gets emotional, and no one does sad girl like Lana Del Rey. Swift's soft, delicate voice on ""Wildest Dreams"" is a distinct echo of Del Rey's in ""Young and Beautiful.""</p> \n<p><b>""Break Free"" </b>by Ariana Grande (feat. Zedd)</p> \n<p>Ariana Grande has a higher drums to vocal ratio in ""Break Free"" than Swift has in ""How You Get the Girl,"" but the spirit of these two songs is the same: girl leaves boy, feels great, moves on.</p> \n<p><b>""Wildest Moments</b>"" by Jessie Ware</p> \n<p>Jessie Ware's new album is exactly what a good pop album should be: emotional, beautiful, and catchy as hell. ""Wildest Moments"" is this playlists' slow jam, meant to accompany your absent ""This Love."" But Ware's song is so strong you'll likely add it to your rotation anyway.</p> \n<p><b>""Born to Die"" </b>by Lana Del Rey</p> \n<p>With its whimsical backing music and angry lyrics, ""I Know Places"" is replaced by another Lana Del Rey gem. ""Baby/ I know places we won't be found,"" has the same angry, sleepy vocals on offer on ""Born to Die.""</p> \n<p><b>""I Blame Myself"" </b>by Sky Ferreira</p> \n<p>""I Blame Myself"" starts out much more upbeat than Swift's ""Clean,"" but by the time the chorus hits, the similarities are remarkable — the same twinkling instrumentals and ah-ing in the background.</p> \n<p><b>""Lights"" </b>by Ellie Goulding</p> \n<p>You can probably make it without replacements for two of <i>1989</i>'s bonus songs, ""Wonderland"" and ""You R In Love,"" but you'll need one for the third bonus track, ""New Romantics."" It's a great song, and it deserves to be the album's closer — just like ""Lights"" is a perfect closer for this replacement playlist.</p> \n<p><i>Listen to this week's playlist here:</i></p> \n<p><iframe allowtransparency=""true"" frameborder=""0"" height=""380"" width=""300"" src=""https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify:user:voxdotcom:playlist:68KTzunEdxp4WJuNHlRmGf""></iframe></p> \n<p><em>Playlist created by Scott Kellum and the Vox music slack room</em></p>",Music

In 2008, she was the heart of the underground hip-hop scene. Before that, she was a rapper. Now, she says, she's on a quest to become one of the most ""epic pop stars"" to come out of Stockholm.</span></p> \n<p>Mapei — whose given name is Jacqueline Mapei Cummings — releases her first full-length studio album <i>Hey Hey </i>today on <a href=""http://downtownrecords.com/"">Downtown Records</a>, on the eve of her U.S. tour with Lykke Li. The album was produced by Magnus Lidehäll, who has previously curated albums for Sky Ferreira, Britney Spears, and Katy Perry. It has elements of every major pop star today. On ""Second to None"" she's harsh like Beyoncé. On ""Come on Baby"" she has the clapping rhythmic beat of Charli XCX. <i>Hey Hey </i>sticks in your brain like any great pop album, but it has just a little bit more heart.</p> \n<p>Here are three songs that should convince you to give Mapei a chance. If you're intrigued, check out the full interview with Mapei about her artistry and background.</p> \n<h3>1. ""Don't Wait""</h3> \n<p>The album kicks off with Mapei's previously released single ""Don't Wait."" It's a fitting beginning because Mapei released ""Don't Wait"" as a transitional song in 2013. Before its release, Mapei had released an EP called <i>Cocoa Butter Diaries </i>that was full of tight verses and spoken word commentary. ""Don't Wait"" created a marked change for Mapei from her background as a rapper and hip-hop artist into the land of pop.</p> \n<p>""Don't Wait"" is a simple song. The acoustics are gentle and subdued, and Mapei sings over just a touch of acoustic guitar. The song allows her buttery voice to shine over the background noise and move listeners through her changing octaves. Mapei's voice sing-speaks the melody, and when she sings, ""If it wasn't for you, I'd be alone/ If it wasn't for you, I'd be on my own / Don't wait 'til I do wrong,"" it's easy to visualize the conversation in which she might say these words, easy as a listener to enter into her world.</p> \n<p><iframe allowtransparency=""true"" frameborder=""0"" height=""380"" width=""300"" src=""https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify:track:1MFzHakkiqSmdPu1CkUy8b""></iframe></p> \n<div class=""chorus-snippet m-fishtank no-responsive-video"">\n  <chorus-ad data-ad-slot=""athena_features""></chorus-ad>\n</div>\n<!--  ########  END SNIPPET  ########  --> \n<!--  ########  END SNIPPET  ########  --> \n<h3>2. ""Change""</h3> \n<p>Mapei's vocals in ""Change"" blend soul-influences and pop buoyancy. Her voice soars as she belts ""Don't you worry about a thing, my brother/ a little love is all it takes. Don't you worry 'bout a thing my sister/ we're all waiting for a change,"" then immediately drops an octave to switch into a spoken word section.</p> \n<p>""Change"" is a song about social progress, but it's also indicative of just how much range Mapei has. This is a pop song, but it features elements of soul, rock, and hip-hop and boasts an electronic production.</p> \n<p><iframe src=""https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify:track:0azBDuwSvMFp7YLhKvISKY"" width=""300"" height=""380"" frameborder=""0"" allowtransparency=""true""></iframe></p> \n<h3>3. ""As 1""</h3> \n<p><i>Hey Hey</i> is an album with 12 solid, pop songs, songs that are upbeat, heavy on melody, and filled with carefully constructed, catchy lyrics. With electronic bubble sounds repeating in the background, ""As 1"" stands out because it sounds different from the rest of the completely upbeat album.</p> \n<p>""As 1"" is a pop song mired in soul roots. ""'As 1' is very soulful,"" Mapei told me, "" and it just reminds of being at my Nanna's house. Every song is a reflection of me, but this one really is.""</p> \n<p><iframe src=""https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify:track:5Xww5uG2LFRgyzvFPQaLe2"" width=""300"" height=""380"" frameborder=""0"" allowtransparency=""true""></iframe>&gt;</p> \n<p> </p> \n</story> <interview> \n<p>Mapei's first full-length studio album <i>Hey Hey </i>releases today on <a href=""http://downtownrecords.com/"">Downtown Records</a>. Produced by Magnus Lidehäll who has previously curated albums for Sky Ferreira, Britney Spears and Katy Perry, <i>Hey Hey </i>sticks in your brain like any great pop album, but has just a little bit more heart.</p> \n<p>Mapei recently spoke with me about her artistry and background. If you're intrigued, check out three songs that should convince you to give Mapei a chance.</p> \n<div class=""question""> \n<p><em class=""name"">Kelsey McKinney:</em>Let's talk about <i>Hey Hey</i> to start. What's this album about, in a general sense?</p> \n</div> \n<div class=""answer""> \n<p><em class=""name"">Mapei:</em> It's an uplifting album. It's positive. It's a lot more about the sound than anything. I wanted to put together an entire album with a feeling, and I feel like I did that.</p> \n</div> \n<div class=""question""> \n<p><em class=""name"">Kelsey McKinney:</em>What were some of your inspirations in creating this album?</p> \n</div> \n<div class=""answer""> \n<p><em class=""name"">Mapei:</em><span>I was in a cold place in Stockholm, and it was winter and dark, and I just wanted to have a fun time in the studio. This album is about fun. It's about pop and dancing.</span></p> \n</div> \n<div> \n<div class=""question""> \n<p><em class=""name"">Kelsey McKinney:</em>Did you grow up wanting to be a musician?</p> \n</div> \n<div class=""answer""> \n<p><em class=""name"">Mapei:</em><span>Definitely. I was always in music class trying to sing. I wrote songs and put together albums and put together titles of songs and drew album covers. I always loved music. The boys I grew up with [in Stockholm] were like, ""Do you know how to rap? You sound American."" And so for a while, I rapped with them. I ended up in the hip-hop scene, but I've always wanted to sing. When I sing, another side comes out of me.</span></p> \n</div> \n<div class=""question""> \n<p><em class=""name"">Kelsey McKinney:</em>How does your heritage influence you?</p> \n</div> \n<div class=""answer""> \n<p><em class=""name"">Mapei:</em><span>Well my mother is from Liberia, so when we went to Sweden, we were immigrants of course. So I connected with immigrants and people who were friendly to immigrants. I learned some Persian. I grew up with people with people from all over the world: from Thailand, from Africa, from Stockholm. </span></p> \n<p><span>I still feel like my upbringing was international growing up in Sweden. I just feel like I'm open-minded. My stepfather is Swedish, so I would call that my home. I feel like I'm everywhere and nowhere at the same time.</span></p> \n</div> \n<div class=""question""> \n<p><em class=""name"">Kelsey McKinney:</em><span>Your EP </span><i style=""line-height: 1.5;"">Cocoa Butter Diaries </i><span>has a lot of social commentary in it, but</span><i style=""line-height: 1.5;""> Don't Wait </i><span>is simpler. How have you grown, and where do you hope this album will take you?</span></p> \n</div> \n<div class=""answer""> \n<p><em class=""name"">Mapei:</em><span>Before, I just wanted to say what I had been through. Maybe I had anger built up from my childhood and what I was going through in life. I just let go of that. I just felt like singing more and being more positive. Yeah. You know when you're going through puberty, you have anger, and that's a lot of what that first album was — that anger. But now, I feel like I've moved past that, that I've grown in a way.</span></p> \n</div> \n<div class=""question""> \n<p><em class=""name"">Kelsey McKinney:</em><i>Hey Hey</i> has a spoken word feel to it in sections. Do you feel influenced by rap or spoken word?</p> \n</div> \n<div class=""answer""> \n<p><em class=""name"">Mapei:</em>I feel that it's like spoken word. I listened to a lot of Saul Williams, a song called ""Talk To Strangers,"" when writing this album, and I think that really affected me. My childhood was listening to a lot of hip-hop and rap, so going back to my mom's house and listening to the albums I listened to when I was a child really impacted my sound.</p> \n</div> \n<div class=""question""> \n<p><em class=""name"">Kelsey McKinney:</em>This is your first full length album, how do you feel on the eve of its release?</p> \n</div> \n<div class=""answer""> \n<p><em class=""name"">Mapei:</em><span>I'm ready. I feel like I did a really good job. A lot of people have writers on their album, but I did this on my own. I had a lot to do with the sound. It was fun, and I didn't feel stressed.</span></p> \n</div> \n<div class=""question""> \n<p><em class=""name"">Kelsey McKinney:</em><span>How do you write your songs?</span></p> \n</div> \n<div class=""answer""> \n<p><em class=""name"">Mapei:</em><span>I come up with a melody first, and then I have stuff that I'm really inspired by. I'll listen to some Twin Sisters and Brownies. I'll listen to some other songs.</span></p> \n<p>It has to feel good. I can't just sing anything. My voice just turns to nothing. It comes from the heart. Sometimes, I would do different songs, and I would be like, ""Nah, this is not me."" I put the songs that I really liked on the album. It's hard when you're adding your soul to an album, but <span>I feel like it's like a rainbow. Like a light at the end of the tunnel I've been looking for.</span></p> \n</div> \n<div class=""question""> \n<p><em class=""name"">Kelsey McKinney:</em><span>You've said before that you want your music to be ""visual."" What do you mean by that?</span></p> \n</div> \n<div class=""answer""> \n<p><em class=""name"">Mapei:</em><span>When I listen to music sometimes, I just see visions. When I listen to a song, I'll just look out the window, and I can imagine a whole scene playing out in front of me. And not just listening to the notes. It's listening to the notes and the lyrics. I want my listeners to see visions when they listen to my album like I see them.

The definitive playlist of songs about butts,http://www.vox.com/2014/11/16/7223005/definitive-playlist-of-songs-about-butts,"The internet remains sound. For now. In honor of Kim, let's see what a playlist of celebratory butt songs does to it.","<p>Most people think the biggest news this week was all about the human race landing a probe on a comet, but did the comet #breaktheinternet? It did not. To be fair, neither did the picture of Kim Kardashian that appeared on Paper Magazine this week, even though it promised to do so by placing her butt front and center.</p> \n<p>The internet remains sound. For now. In honor of Kim, let's see what a playlist of celebratory butt songs does to it.</p> \n<p><b>""Bootylicious"" </b>by Destiny's Child</p> \n<p>Destiny's Child's ""Bootylicious"" kicks off this butt-centric playlist with a repetitive drum beat and soaring duets. This song also popularized everyone's favorite Beyoncé line: ""I don't think you're ready for this jelly."" Just like you're not ready for this playlist, internet.</p> \n<p><b>""Booty</b>"" by Jennifer Lopez, feat. Iggy Azalea</p> \n<p>JLo's ""Booty"" sounds gratingly repetitive on a first listen, but the pairing of Lopez's vocals and Azalea's speak-singing actually creates different levels for a song that takes as its refrain ""Throw up your hands if you love a big booty."" Okay! Why not?</p> \n<p><b>""Dance (A$$) Remix""</b> by Big Sean, feat. Nicki Minaj</p> \n<p>Big Sean, rapper and boyfriend of Ariana Grande, had his first big hit with ""Dance (A$$)."". But the song's remix, featuring <span>Nikki Minaj, really brings this booty song to the next level. </span><span>Minaj raps,</span><span> ""Wobbledy wobble, wo-wo-wobble, wobbin"" about 100 times better than Big Sean does.</span></p> \n<p><b>""Anaconda"" </b>by Nicki Minaj</p> \n<p>This year, Minaj released her own butt-tastic anthem, featuring such stellar rapping as, ""He keep telling me it's real, that he love my sex appeal/ Because he don't like 'em boney, he want something he can grab.""</p> \n<p><b style=""font-size: 15.4545450210571px; line-height: 1.5;"">""Ms. New Booty""</b><span> by Bubba Sparxxx, feat. Ying Yang Twins</span></p> \n<p>This 2005 club favorite tends to lead to instantaneous bouncing. And how can you not love a song with lyrics like:</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>""Shake your ass, and the player's gonna show some love<br>Do that move you did just a minute ago<br>I guarantee you'll make all the dough""</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p><b>""My Humps"" </b>by The Black Eyed Peas</p> \n<p>Fergie's new song doesn't hold a candle to the Black Eyed Peas 2009 hit ""My Humps."" Fergie owns this song, both in lyrical quality and personal domination. She just <i>sounds</i> like she's in charge. Check it out.</p> \n<p><b>""Bubble Butt""</b> by Major Lazer, feat. 2 Chainz, Bruno Mars, Tyga, and Mystic</p> \n<p>There are almost as many voices in this song as there are repetitions of the words ""bubble butt,"" but that's not a bad thing. Bruno Mars's and Tyga's voices sound so different from the chorus by Major Lazer that the song maintains an interesting variation all the way through.</p> \n<p><b>""Shake Your Booty""</b> by KC and the Sunshine Band</p> \n<p>Take a break from all of this recent Top 40 music with this 1976 throwback. It's good, clean-sounding fun. ""Shake shake shake/ Shake shake shake/Shake your boo-tay"" KC and the Sunshine Band command, and it's hard to resist. Pretend you're in a movie set in the '70s.</p> \n<p><b>""Rump Shaker"" </b>by Wreckx-N-Effect</p> \n<p>""Check baby, check baby/ one two three four,"" Wreckx-N-Effect's  ""Rump Shaker""  is everything great about early '90s rap: strange rhymes, catchy choruses, and a horn backing.</p> \n<p><b>""Fat Bottomed Girls""</b> by Queen</p> \n<p>Queen's '80s rock harmonies make for one of the most interesting songs on this playlist, since it feels like there are three songs packed into one four-minute track. And Queen is right: fat bottomed girls do, in fact, make the world go round, even if they don't #breaktheinternet.</p> \n<p><b style=""font-size: 15.4545450210571px; line-height: 1.5;"">""Back That Azz Up""</b><span> by Juvenile</span></p> \n<p>The radio version of this song was titled ""Back that Thang Up,"" which was not nearly as exciting as the original version (the one featured here), featuring choice lines like <span>""Girl, you looks good, won't you back that azz up/</span><span>You'se a fine motherfucker, won't you back that azz up.""</span></p> \n<p><b>""Baby Got Back"" </b>by Sir-Mix-A-Lot</p> \n<p>This is the king of all booty songs, and there is no better way to close out this playlist. It's been copied by many artists, sampled by some, and played to the accompaniment of quiet giggles at every middle school dance since the song first landed in 1992.</p> \n<p> </p> \n<p><iframe frameborder=""0"" width=""300"" height=""380"" src=""https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify:user:voxdotcom:playlist:78I13BPzSfTweJgFGAILuu"" allowtransparency=""true""></iframe></p>",Music

"Is streaming bad for artists? Yes and no. The future of music,Â explained.",http://www.vox.com/2014/11/24/7272423/taylor-swift-spotify,Here's everything you need to know to understand music streaming.,"<p>Just a few days after her new album dropped, Taylor Swift <a href=""http://www.vox.com/xpress/2014/11/3/7149541/taylor-swift-music-off-spotify-rip-us"" target=""_blank"">pulled every song</a> she had ever performed from online streaming service Spotify. Soon after, her music disappeared from Rdio. In an exclusive interview with Yahoo!, Swift backed up her decision, using an argument you've likely heard many times before: <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/11/5/7154357/taylor-swift-sold-2-albums-every-second-last-week-but-thats-not-the"" target=""_blank"">streaming is bad for artists.</a></p> \n<p>The argument, at its core, goes something like this. A single album is worth approximately $12, but a <a href=""https://www.spotify.com/us/"" target=""_blank"">Spotify user</a> can listen to the whole album for free, with only minimal ad interruption. (Subscribers are spared ads.)</p> \n<p>She's not alone on this soapbox. Avicii's ""<a href=""https://play.spotify.com/album/37qAVEAZSyRTVFvVRHcwOa"" target=""_blank"">Wake Me Up!</a>"" was one of the most streamed <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/11/8/7175585/taylor-swift-isnt-on-spotify-anymore-but-heres-a-playlist-of"" target=""_blank"">songs on Spotify</a>, and the 13th most played song on Pandora since 2013. Yet, Aloe Blacc, who co-wrote and sang ""Wake Me Up,"" made less than $4,000 domestically for a hit song. That's not, <a href=""http://www.wired.com/2014/11/aloe-blacc-pay-songwriters/"">Blacc argued for Wired</a>, a liveable wage. He's one of thousands of artists and songwriters whose songs, despite high play counts, aren't making them enough money to live.</p> \n<p>Streaming certainly doesn't <i>seem</i> fair, but that's because it's only a tiny sliver of the complicated economics of the music industry. Swift and other artists frame streaming as a horrible thing for musicians and artists, but by doing so, they frame the argument in a way that ignores the enormous monetary potential streaming holds for artists — and the role labels play in the whole mess.</p> \n<p>Here's everything you need to know to understand streaming:</p> \n<h3>1) Why do artists think streaming is bad for them?</h3> \n<p>To start, not all artists think streaming is bad for them. Like any massive group of people, artists have varying opinions on<a href=""http://musically.com/2014/04/01/david-byrne-speaks-out-again-on-artists-survival-in-the-streaming-music-era/""> how good</a> or <a href=""http://www.wired.com/2014/11/aloe-blacc-pay-songwriters/"">bad </a>streaming is. But the first thing anti-streaming artists will tell you is that album sales are down a whopping 14 percent this year. That's bad.</p> \n<p>Also, let's not discount the role fame plays here. The most famous artists (see: <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/8/19/6033483/taylor-swift-new-single-shake-it-off-video"" target=""_blank"">Taylor Swift</a>) have the biggest megaphones and, thus, can explain more readily why they believe streaming is bad for artists.</p> \n<p>Here's what Swift said in her op-ed about streaming in <a href=""http://online.wsj.com/articles/for-taylor-swift-the-future-of-music-is-a-love-story-1404763219"" target=""_blank"">the Wall Street Journal</a>:</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>""It's my opinion that music should not be free, and my prediction is that individual artists and their labels will someday decide what an album's price point is. I hope they don't underestimate themselves or undervalue their art.""</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Got that? It's about money, but it's also about <i>art</i>. Much of the argument against streaming hangs in that delicate balance. Music is an art form, and therefore, any song Taylor Swift creates is <i>her </i>song and can't be duplicated. But music is also a business, and artists want to be paid for those unique songs.</p> \n<p>Swift's label, <a href=""http://www.bigmachinelabelgroup.com/"" target=""_blank"">Big Machine</a>, handles that business. ""The facts show that the music industry was much better off before Spotify hit these shores,"" Scott Borchetta, CEO of Big Machine, told <a href=""http://content.time.com/time/magazine/?cdn-url=http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3581487%2Ftaylor-swift-spotify-borchetta%2F%3Futm_content%3Dbuffer2accf%26utm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_source%3Dtwitter.com%26utm_campaign%3Dbuffer"">Time Magazine</a>. He went on to claim that Spotify only paid Swift $500,000 dollars off of her domestic plays last year. That's slightly less than 50,000 albums sold, when Swift regularly sells millions.</p> \n<h3>2) How did Spotify respond to these claims?</h3> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""2485704"" alt=""spotify"" src=""https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2485704/spotify.0.jpg""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">A Spotify press event (Spencer Platt/Getty)</p> \n<p>Spotify opposes <a href=""http://www.theverge.com/tag/taylor-swift"" target=""_blank"">Swift's claim</a> that she was paid only $500,000, saying it paid $2 million last year for Swift's songs and that it expects to pay $6 million this year.</p> \n<p>Why the disparity? Both sides were cherry-picking numbers that fit their arguments. <a href=""http://www.theverge.com/2014/11/6/7170663/taylor-swift-says-says-spotify-doesnt-pay-artists-fairly"" target=""_blank"">For Spotify</a>, that was the projected payout for all Swift streams globally over the calendar year (<a href=""http://www.theverge.com/2014/11/13/7213775/taylor-swift-spotify-borchetta-royalties"" target=""_blank"">$6 million</a>). For Camp Swift, that number was streams in the last six months, domestically.</p> \n<p>But this is a symptom of a <a href=""http://www.theverge.com/2014/11/18/7243193/sony-music-is-re-evaluating-its-approach-to-streaming"" target=""_blank"">larger debate</a> about whether streaming services are cannibalizing album sales and digital downloads, and whether artists will be able to make a livable wage from their work in the future.</p> \n<h3>3) What is streaming?</h3> \n<p>In layman's terms, ""streaming"" often simply means listening to music on a computer, without a physical copy. But that's not how legal or revenue systems define streaming. iTunes is a very different entity from <a href=""https://www.spotify.com/us/"" target=""_blank"">Spotify</a>, and, thus, plays by different rules. And <a href=""http://www.pandora.com/"" target=""_blank"">Pandora</a> is very different from both.</p> \n<p>Legally, streaming is divided into three broad categories:</p> \n<ol> \n<li> <b>Online music stores: </b>This form of streaming encompasses places like iTunes, which sell and distribute music, and work directly with record labels to determine price-points. They aren't a big part of the debate around ""streaming"" today, but it's important to remember that when <a href=""http://money.cnn.com/2013/04/25/technology/itunes-music-decline/"" target=""_blank"">iTunes debuted in 2002</a>, everyone was pretty sure it was going to <a href=""http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/music-arts/itunes-transformed-music-industry-article-1.1326387"" target=""_blank"">kill the music industry</a>, too. All of these services have seen a drop in revenue in the past few years, and are looking to get into other forms of streaming (see: <a href=""http://www.theverge.com/2014/10/21/7027707/google-brings-best-songza-feature-to-play-music"" target=""_blank"">Google Play</a>).</li> \n<li> <b style=""font-size: 1.15em;"">Non-interactive services: </b><span>This form of streaming functions similarly to the radio. A user tells the service what they like (country music or Taylor Swift), and an algorithm creates a playlist of songs that user will like. See: <a href=""http://www.pandora.com/"" target=""_blank"">Pandora</a> and </span><a href=""http://www.iheart.com/"" target=""_blank"">IheartRadio.</a> </li> \n<li> <b style=""font-size: 1.15em; line-height: 1.65;"">Interactive:</b><span> Interactive services, like Spotify and <a href=""http://www.rdio.com/home/en-us/"" target=""_blank"">Rdio</a>, let users pick the songs they want to listen to in whatever order they like. This is the group that Swift's label is pushing against, perhaps because they are the easiest target. It's harder to argue against iTunes, which has a direct, per-song payout, or Pandora, which is too much like traditional radio. </span> </li> \n</ol> \n<p><span>The elephant in the room during any conversation about streaming is </span><a href=""http://www.riaa.com/faq.php"" target=""_blank"">piracy</a><span>. Music executives in every camp know that if they make consumers unhappy enough, they could just start stealing music quite easily.</span></p> \n<h3>4) Does it matter what kind of streaming we are talking about?</h3> \n<p>Different forms of streaming pay artists different amounts of money. How a company is classified legally determines how much money it has to pay artists.</p> \n<p>Non-interactive services have a simple task here, because they are covered legally by <a href=""http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/114"" target=""_blank"">Section 114 of the Copyright Act</a>. What that means, in essence, is that for Pandora to play any song that has ever been written, it only has to do one major negotiation with the groups that own the rights to that music. The reason why has to do with the amount of choice the listener has. If you start a Taylor Swift station on Pandora, you will hear some Taylor Swift songs, but you can't pick which ones.</p> \n<p>A company like Spotify has no sweeping legal protections on what it pays per song, because you can always choose what you're going to listen to next. These companies have to negotiate separately with every single label.</p> \n<p>For Spotify, many of those negotiations didn't go ideally, and the company had to give up shares of itself to convince the three major labels to participate. Those labels are the reason that it <a href=""http://gizmodo.com/5821056/why-did-it-take-so-long-for-spotify-to-come-to-the-us"">took Spotify so long</a> to migrate from Europe to the United States. It's estimated that the major US labels own between half and two-thirds of all music.</p> \n<p>Spotify is also often forced to re-negotiate with any label that doesn't like how much it is getting paid, which is how Taylor Swift pulled her music. Most likely, she (or her label) wanted more money, Spotify didn't agree, and negotiations fell through.</p> \n<h3 id=""5"">5) Okay, so how does the money flow work?</h3> \n<p>No one single person owns a song, and no one single person is paid for a song.  For every song on the market, there are a minimum of two parties who must be paid.</p> \n<p>""Every song has two copyrights attached to it,"" Greg Barnes, a lawyer and the general counsel for the Digital Music Association, told me. This means that ""every service makes two payments — one for composition, and one for song recording.""</p> \n<p>Here's how those sides stack up:</p> \n<ul> \n<li> <b>Sound recording</b>: This is the license needed for the actual song played. This license is usually between the artist, the record label that represents them, and the company trying to play the song.</li> \n<li> <b>Musical composition: </b>This is the license that covers everything else, including the people who wrote the song, recorded the song, and published the song. This license gets paid no matter who sings the song. So if an artist covers a song, the people who made that song possible still get paid. </li> \n</ul> \n<p>For non-interactive services, payment is simple: they pay the licensing fee for the sound recording license, and they negotiate a deal with the three major Performance Rights Organizations (PROs) for the right to play pretty much every song ever written.</p> \n<p>Interactive services have a harder time of it:</p> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2485682/StreamingMoney.0.png"" alt=""tyson streaming"" data-chorus-asset-id=""2485682""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">How the money flows (data by Future of Music. Graphic by Tyson Whiting)</p> \n<p>If that seems complicated, then you're on the right track. Because it <i>is</i> complicated, often <i>incredibly</i> so.</p> \n<p>The money, as you can see in these charts, has to jump through several middlemen before reaching the artist. Big Machine is an indie label, so Swift would be in the third scenario, but she's also a songwriter, so her money comes from both sound recording and composition. Because her family owns her label, she also likely gets a hefty chunk of that money.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""center"">If that seems complicated, then you're on the right track. Because it <i style=""line-height: 28.4624996185303px;""><b>is</b> </i>complicated, often <i style=""line-height: 28.4624996185303px;"">incredibly</i> so.</q></p> \n<p>""If you’re a signed artist, you are paid whatever is in your recording contract,"" Casey Rae, Vice President for Policy &amp; Education at the Future of Music Coalition, told me. ""And there's not a lot of transparency there. When young artists sign with a label, they don't always realize how much of their money they are signing away.""</p> \n<p>Even an artist with a good record label and a good deal is only one part of a giant group of people who work together to get a song to listeners. And all of those people have to get paid.</p> \n<h3>6) Wait.

Listeners are more likely to click on a Swift track than one by an unknown artist, thus allowing Swift to argue her music is more valuable to the service and should be worth more. On Pandora, even though <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/8/19/6033483/taylor-swift-new-single-shake-it-off-video""> Taylor Swift </a>gets paid for every single play of every single one of her songs, it might take a user a few hours to get through one of her albums in its entirety, because the system functions like radio.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""right"">Taylor Swift is the 1 percent of artists</q></p> \n<p>Here is where it's important to remember that Taylor Swift is not <i>every </i>artist.

Most artists don't have lucrative deals with their labels. Hell, most artists can barely <i>negotiate</i> with their labels because of deals made when they were up-and-coming and willing to sign anything to get in the door.</p> \n<p>Interactive and non-interactive services function, respectively, in the most basic sense, like capitalism and socialism. Spotify, like capitalism, allows goods worth a greater commodity to be sold at a greater price to the benefit of a few. Pandora, however, pays all artists at the same rate, making it potentially a better deal for a new artist who just wants to find fans.</p> \n<h3>7) I'm tired. Can we take a break and listen to some music?</h3> \n<p>Sure.</p> \n<p>Here is Celine Dion performing ""My Heart Will Go On."" Dion is a <a href=""http://www.billboard.com/articles/list/5930326/music-s-top-40-money-makers-2014-the-rich-list?list_page=2"">champion of music streaming</a>.</p> \n<p><iframe frameborder=""0"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/WNIPqafd4As"" height=""360"" width=""640""></iframe></p> \n<h3><span>8) What about songwriters and everyone else? Do they want more money too?</span></h3> \n<p>Yes, definitely.</p> \n<p>Streaming (both interactive and non-interactive) is a much better deal for recording artists than radio airplay ever was. But it's less clear it's a better deal for songwriters. In fact, AM/FM radio<a href=""https://futureofmusic.org/blog/2014/05/08/new-bill-pay-artists-amfm-play"" target=""_blank""> <i>still </i>doesn't pay recording artists</a> a dime for playing songs on air, but AM/FM radio <i>does</i> pay songwriters.</p> \n<p>As Barnes told me, ""The real issue here is that songwriters believe that they are not being fairly compensated by streaming services (both interactive or non-interactive) in comparison to the amount we pay for the sound recording.""</p> \n<p>According to Barnes, <a href=""http://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/1083455/business-matters-the-truth-about-pandoras-payments-to-artists"" target=""_blank"">Pandora pays out </a>almost half of its revenue to recording artists, but only 6 percent to songwriters. For songwriters, the amount of money that 6 percent boils down to simply isn't enough to live on.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""center"">Streaming is new, and many of the laws around it are subject to change in the next 18 months.</q></p> \n<p>Streaming is new, and many of the laws around it are subject to change in the next 18 months. Thus, for groups that feel they aren't making enough money, streaming is an easy target. Yes, streaming often doesn't pay even a mega-selling artist like <a href=""http://www.vox.com/xpress/2014/10/24/7061625/taylor-swift-1989-leaked-album-leak"" target=""_blank"">Taylor Swift</a> what she's worth. The problem is that songwriters, label executives, producers, and everybody else feel the same way.</p> \n<p>""The government is what can help establish rules for the market about what the future of music can be, but that means they may need to redraw the lines,"" Rae told me. ""Why doesn’t terrestrial radio pay artists? That’s insane. It’s un-American. It puts other services at a disadvantage. It distorts the marketplace right out of the gate. Why do these guys pay under different umbrellas? Those are the kinds of questions we need to answer at a governmental level to make this system work for everyone.""</p> \n<h3>9) What benefits to streaming are there that there wouldn't be with major labels in charge?</h3> \n<p>The biggest benefit in the streaming system is for consumers. Never in history have they had so much access to so much music. Instead of having to buy everything, consumers have pretty much anything they can think of at their fingertips at any time — and all for minimal cost.</p> \n<p>""There used to just be a handful of ways to get into the marketplace. Now there are infinite ways. The earlier system still had a lot of disadvantages like limited shelf space, and fewer chances for the non-mainstream artists to get heard,"" Rae told me. ""By the 2000s, three white men in a room could set up the hits for the calendar year.""</p> \n<p>Now, that doesn't mean that anyone can become famous. ""The idea that you can put something online and your fans will magically find you is 2002. ... A label can help you achieve things that you can’t achieve on your own,"" Rae said. Artists no longer need labels to make their CDs (or records) and distribute them across the country, though many labels still do. But a good label can still help an artist immensely by planning tours, marketing music, running social media presences, and pairing them up with bigger bands on tour. Labels can also serve as a seasoned eye in an industry where loopholes are everywhere.</p> \n<p>But what streaming can help with is finding fans. Even in the iTunes store, there is only so much prominent shelf space. Listeners generally buy the songs that they can <i>find</i>. The great thing about streaming is that consumers can find more music, support more bands, and create more diversity in popular music.</p> \n<p>Non-interactive streaming services like Pandora can especially help direct listeners towards artists they will love, but never would have heard on the radio. Pandora recently partnered with indie-band label <a href=""http://www.billboard.com/articles/business/6207058/pandora-label-deal-merlin"">Merlin Records</a>, meaning a Taylor Swift-themed station will also pull up smaller, indie- country artists like Kasey Musgraves. That's great for Musgraves, and it's also great for listeners.</p> \n<p><a href=""http://www.vox.com/xpress/2014/10/22/7038465/pandora-amp-artists-data"">Pandora also recently announced</a> that it would share its data with artists in order to help them plan better tours and find their fan bases. <a href=""http://press.pandora.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=251764&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=1980275"">Over 80 percent of the artists</a> played on Pandora receive no traditional radio play, so that kind of data can help launch their careers.</p> \n<h3>10) Is streaming bad for artists? Or good for them?</h3> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""2443804"" alt=""taylor"" src=""https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2443804/Screen_Shot_2014-11-10_at_9.19.30_AM.0.png""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Screenshot from Taylor Swift's ""Blank Space"" (Vevo)</p> \n<p>No. Streaming is not bad for artists. But it's also far from perfect.</p> \n<p>When an artist compares her revenue from album sales to her revenue from streaming, streaming will end up paying out less — and sometimes quite a bit less. But that doesn't mean that streaming is bad, or that the decreased revenues are the streaming service's fault. Artists might be failed by their label or their publishing company. Their contract might have signed away their copyright, thus ensuring they receive very little payment for streaming.</p> \n<p>""The question for average artists is, do these streaming models add up to manageable revenue?"" Rae told me. ""It’s about being able to do regular things like pay your electric bill."" For some of them, the answer to that question is yes. But for many of them, the system as a whole still needs to change to make it possible to earn one's livelihood as a musician.</p> \n<p>The music industry has changed drastically since iTunes debuted in 2002. Major labels are no longer the sole distributors of Top 40 music, and because artists rely less on labels to produce physical copies of their work, their importance to artists on a personal level is fading fast. For artists, the major music labels have quickly become superfluous to their work.</p> \n<p>But they certainly are not superfluous to the way the industry functions. The three major labels control most of the industry. They own the publishing companies and PROs. They dominate the conversation when copyright battles around streaming happen in court. They often have more sway in those conversations than they maybe should.</p> \n<p>""What we could use is a lot of disruption,"" Emily White, the founder of Whitesmith Entertainment, a talent management company that works with many young artists, told me. ""What I would like to see is some equality. Here is the pot of money. We are going to divide it out. But no one has quite figured out how to do that yet.""</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""center"">""What we could use is a lot of disruption. What I would like to see is some equality.""</q></p> \n<p>The kind of disruption White is talking about — with money being redistributed and every form of music service being reevaluated — could take years and would require at least some governmental intervention. That may begin late this winter, when the Department of Justice reviews Pandora's license with the PROs.</p> \n<p>But the big question remains: how do you keep consumers using digital services instead of pirating music, while making sure that artists (and songwriters and producers and labels) receive adequate payment?</p> \n<p>No one has a firm answer to this question. But the clock is ticking. Streaming isn't going anywhere. How it will (or won't) become a viable revenue source for artists may determine the future of the industry.</p>",Music

Why do artists keep making holiday albums? Because they still sell lots of copies.,http://www.vox.com/2014/11/28/7296783/holiday-albums-explained,Here's everything you need to know about holiday albums:,"<p>Christmas music has been playing since sometime in November — and maybe even before that.</p> \n<p>As you put up the tree, traditional Christmas carols rang out. When you shopped for presents at the mall, Mariah Carey's voice rang in your ears. The soundtrack of the past month has been the same songs on an endless loop. Maybe you're still excited about hearing ""Jingle Bells"" sung by a school choir. But more likely than not, you're getting sick of them. You're starting to remember why you hated them so much last year because it seems like Christmas music is everywhere.</p> \n<p>But why are there so many holiday albums? Why is Christmas music such a perennial seller? Here's everything you need to know.</p> \n<h3>1) When are holiday albums released?</h3> \n<p>Most holiday albums are actually released long before the holiday season so that they have time to pick up popularity, airplay, and even a few early sales. A popular holiday album can come out anywhere from early October to the first week of December and still do moderately well on the charts.</p> \n<p>In the wake of her ""Let it Go"" sensation, Idina Menzel released a holiday album this year on October 14. She told Time that she thought the release was too early, saying, ""I don’t understand. I’ve been asking the label to tell me why. Apparently, that’s when people start buying stuff for Christmas.""</p> \n<p>Menzel hits on an important point here. Holiday albums aren't released due to anything having to do with the holidays themselves. Instead, they're released at the time the record label thinks will optimize their sales and plays. It might seem odd to you — and Idina Menzel — to find her album on the shelves before Halloween, but her label knows that album needs time to build momentum.</p> \n<p>But not everyone counts on that sort of slow growth. Tiny, demon-loving pop sensation Ariana Grande released her holiday song, ""Santa Tell Me,"" on November 24:</p> \n<p><iframe src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/jnXxxKZ57Tw"" frameborder=""0"" height=""480"" width=""853""></iframe></p> \n<h3><span>2) Why do artists make holiday albums?</span></h3> \n<h3><img data-chorus-asset-id=""2496392"" alt=""Mariah Carey"" src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2496392/mariah.0.jpg""></h3> \n<p class=""caption"">Mariah Carey performs a Christmas concert (Paul Morigi/Getty)</p> \n<p>Some artists genuinely love Christmas music. Many, when asked why they chose to create a holiday album, will respond with something about their great love for Christmas music and how great nostalgia is.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""center"">Making a holiday album is a great way to pull in some extra cash</q></p> \n<p>But for most artists (and probably even those who genuinely love this music), making a holiday album is about money. Making a holiday album is a great way to pull in some extra cash in a year when an artist hasn't created a plethora of new, personal work.</p> \n<p>Because holiday songs are classics, the copyrights for composition rights often have lapsed, are owned by the public, or never existed at all. That means that when an artist performs a Christmas song, instead of both the copyright holder and the performer needing to be paid, only they (the performer) get any revenue from of the song, which in turn means more money. Creating a holiday album composed of only classics (as <a href=""http://open.spotify.com/album/61ulfFSmmxMhc2wCdmdMkN"">Mariah Carey did</a>) can be a very lucrative career move.</p> \n<p>And if you can somehow <i>write</i> a new holiday classic — though this is very tough — you could be raking in earnings for decades to come, as your song becomes a standard and more and more artists cover it.</p> \n<h3>3) What are the most lucrative Christmas albums of all time?</h3> \n<p>Most album sales rankings are made by Nielsen Soundscan. But, because Soundscan only began keeping track in 1991, some of the most popular Christmas albums of all time are excluded from that list.</p> \n<p>A better way to rank holiday albums is to use <a href=""https://www.riaa.com/"">RIAA record sales</a>, which include the Soundscan rankings and albums released before that (albeit with less exact data than Soundscan has provided).</p> \n<p>Here are the top 10 holiday albums in recorded history:</p> \n<ol> \n<li> <i>Elvis' Christmas Album </i>by Elvis (1970)</li> \n<li> <i>Miracles: The Holiday Album</i> by Kenny G (1994)</li> \n<li> <i>Now That's What I Call Christmas! </i>by various artists (2001)</li> \n<li> <i>A Fresh Aire Christmas </i>by Mannheim Steamroller (1988)</li> \n<li> <i>Mannheim Steamroller Christmas</i> by Mannheim Steamroller ( 1984) </li> \n<li> <i>The Christmas Song </i>by Nat King Cole (1963) </li> \n<li> <i>Noël </i>by Josh Grobin (2007)</li> \n<li> <i>These are Special Times</i> by Celine Dion (1998)</li> \n<li> <i>Merry Christmas</i> by Mariah Carey (1994)</li> \n<li> <i> A Christmas Album</i> by Barbara Streisand (1967)</li> \n</ol> \n<h3>4) Can I hear Elvis sing one of his Christmas songs?</h3> \n<p>Of course. Elvis's holiday album went diamond on the RIAA charts, selling more than 10 million copies. There's probably a copy in your parent's house somewhere that you could dig out right now, but here's an embed of the whole thing:</p> \n<p><iframe src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/SfS6vqUw0cw"" frameborder=""0"" height=""480"" width=""640""></iframe></p> \n<p>and <a href=""http://open.spotify.com/album/3Jxbxc50mckc4xrw2dg4yD"">here it is on Spotify</a>.</p> \n<h3>5) Do Christmas albums still sell, even though album sales are down across the board?</h3> \n<p>There's a lot of talk this year about album sales and the future of the music industry, because album sales across the board are down 14 percent. When we look at album sales since 1991, there is an obvious peak in sales around the time the CD took over (1999) and before iTunes entered the market (2002). <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/11/5/7154357/taylor-swift-sold-2-albums-every-second-last-week-but-thats-not-the"">Of the 19 albums that sold 1 million copies in their first week</a>, 10 were released in that time period.</p> \n<p>But with Christmas album sales, there's a little more room to be optimistic. In 2007, Josh Grobin's <i>Noël </i>went five times platinum. In 2009, Andrea Boccelli's <i>My Christmas</i> went platinum twice, and in 2010 Susan Boyle's <i>The Gift </i>went platinum thrice. Holiday albums, after all, make great gifts for those you're not sure what to buy for, and that means they have a good shot at being perennial sellers.</p> \n<p>That said, it's telling that there hasn't been a top selling holiday album in the last four years. Idina Menzel's October release only sold around <a href=""http://headlineplanet.com/home/2014/10/15/idina-menzels-holiday-wishes-pacing-18-21k-sales/"">21,000 copies</a>, which is very bad for an album released by a star. Here's hoping her label was right about building momentum through New Year's Day.</p> \n<p> </p> \n<h3>6) Are Christmas albums exclusively made by people who celebrate Christmas?</h3> \n<h3><img data-chorus-asset-id=""2496410"" alt=""barbara"" src=""https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2496410/barbara.0.jpg""></h3> \n<p class=""caption""> </p> \n<p class=""caption"">Barbara Stresiand has a full Christmas album! (Kevin Winter/Getty)</p> \n<p>Nope. Barbara Streisand, who is Jewish, made one of the top 10 selling Christmas albums of all time. As the also Jewish Idina Menzel told <a style=""font-size: 1.15em; line-height: 1.65; background-color: #ffffff;"" href=""http://time.com/3503348/idina-menzel-christmas-album/"">Time</a><span>:</span></p> \n<p>""Most of them were songs that I’ve always wanted to sing. 'Do You Hear What I Hear?' is a song Whitney Houston sang back in the ‘80s. Her version is incredible. I’ve always loved that song. If Barbra Streisand can make a Christmas album, I can.""</p> \n<h3>7) When is an appropriate time to start listening to Holiday music?</h3> \n<p>This is a hotly contested issue, and one that shouldn't be taken lightly. If holiday music is played too early, it can make the Grinches among us sad and disgruntled. If played too late, an opportunity for joy can be missed entirely.  The best time to start listening to holiday music is the day after Thanksgiving. Let Thanksgiving be its own thing, then haul out your battered copies of Elvis and Kenny G.</p> \n<h3>8) Do you have any good holiday album recommendations?</h3> \n<p>Yes. Of course we do. You already know the top 10 big sellers, so here are 5 you might not have heard of:</p> \n<ul> \n<li>James Brown recorded three Christmas albums before he died in 2008. The best of each is added to  <a href=""http://open.spotify.com/album/5IEg0oP2tkX7XGOGXyB6wM""><i>James Brown's Funky Christmas</i></a><i>, </i>an album full of classics like ""Merry Christmas Baby"" and some of Brown's own concoctions such as ""Santa Claus Goes to the Ghetto"" and ""Go Power at Christmas Time."" </li> \n<li>If you like your Christmas albums full of superstars, <a href=""http://open.spotify.com/album/109y0mnkGZAYVQNdT0SN3q""><i>A Motown Christmas </i></a> is a perfect holiday jam. Released in 1973, the album features songs by Michael Jackson, Marvin Gaye, the Temptations, and Stevie Wonder. </li> \n<li> <a href=""http://open.spotify.com/album/2kzkwgOFAtRsDsas5Hi0Qu""><i>A Christmas Gift for you From Phil Spector</i></a><i> </i>is another great compilation album featuring some great 1960s voices performing classic songs. You want Darlene Love singing ""White Christmas."" Trust us. </li> \n<li>For the indie-rocker, soft-sound lovers among you, there's not much better than Sufjan Steven's <a href=""http://open.spotify.com/album/26kXeKHRO3RcNbQ5Onc4QQ""><i>Songs for Christmas</i></a>, a four part album with pretty much every famous Christmas song sung in Steven's gravely voice. </li> \n<li>Kate and Anna McGarrigle created one a voice driven album full of historic Christmas hymns in their album <a href=""http://open.spotify.com/album/6aaHtM1vrImoBNGsh6jfou"">The McGarrigle Christmas Hour</a>. The songs are eerie, and soothing, and absolutely beatuiful. </li> \n</ul> \n<h3>9) What if I want to listen to months worth of Christmas music?</h3> \n<p>Here's a playlist of enough Christmas songs to get you from now until probably Valentine's Day, if that's your jam.</p> \n<p><iframe allowtransparency=""true"" src=""https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify:user:toddvdw:playlist:6x0uAPukEvbGafOiAmDVjW"" frameborder=""0"" height=""380"" width=""300""></iframe></p>",Music

This was a meh-watch.""</p> \n<p>Granted, that didn't mean there weren't hate-tweets to be found (examples below). It just means that the hate-tweets were somehow different than last year's, as DC Theatre critic John Dellaporta <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://dctheatrescene.com/2014/12/05/peter-pan-live-nbc-delight-musicals-fans/"">notes</a>.</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p><span>If last year was venomous, this year was merely spicy.

Let us explain.</p> \n<h3>What is hate-watching?</h3> \n<p>Hate-watching is watching a show or movie you suspect you will emphatically dislike, for the purpose of being able to talk about how much you disliked it, either during the program (on social media) or afterward.</p> \n<p>Hate-watching often serves as an added punchline to the thing being watched. It's performative — almost as performative as the hate-product. As TV critic <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://about.me/tvmcgee"">Ryan McGee</a> told me in an email, ""<span>It's meant to be consumed in tandem with the show as the exclamation, punchline, or lament to the thing that happened onscreen."" </span></p> \n<p>For example, the pun heard 'round the world during <i>Peter Pan Live</i> was a riff on ""Walken the plank."" That particular joke was only vaguely amusing when Captain Hook (played by Christopher Walken) was … walking the plank.</p> \n<!--[if gte mso 9]><xml> 0   0   1   19   109   Vox Media   1   1   127   14.0 </xml><![endif]--> <!--[if gte mso 9]><xml> Normal   0               false   false   false      EN-US   JA   X-NONE </xml><![endif]--><!--[if gte mso 9]><xml> </xml><![endif]--> <!--[if gte mso 10]> \n<style> \n /* Style Definitions */ \ntable.MsoNormalTable \n\t{mso-style-name:""Table Normal""; \n\tmso-tstyle-rowband-size:0; \n\tmso-tstyle-colband-size:0; \n\tmso-style-noshow:yes; \n\tmso-style-priority:99; \n\tmso-style-parent:""""; \n\tmso-padding-alt:0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt; \n\tmso-para-margin:0in; \n\tmso-para-margin-bottom:.0001pt; \n\tmso-pagination:widow-orphan; \n\tfont-size:12.0pt; \n\tfont-family:Cambria; \n\tmso-ascii-font-family:Cambria; \n\tmso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin; \n\tmso-hansi-font-family:Cambria; \n\tmso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin;} \n</style> \n<![endif]--> \n<h3 id=""ql-line-691"">Can I see some examples?</h3> \n<p>Sure.

That's the way many hate-watched <i>Sound of Music</i>. To be sure, some tuned in out of sheer curiosity, wondering whether the country pop star could reinvent Julie Andrews' iconic role. But for the most part, the ethos on Twitter was OMG LOL WUT KILL ME.</p> \n<p>There is another kind of hate-watching, though, where, even though you figure the show will probably be bad, you tune in hoping it will surprise you because you really, secretly, deep down want it to be good. The difference is that the second kind of hate-watching reserves its final judgment until the entire show — or at least a substantial portion of it — has been seen. In the end, it seemed like most who watched <i>Peter Pan Live</i> and found it either better than expected or just kinda boring fell into this camp.</p> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2522470/peterpan19f-2-web.0.jpg"" alt=""Christopher and Allison"" data-chorus-asset-id=""2522470""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Christopher Walken and Allison Williams. (NBC)</p> \n<h3><span>Is that good criticism?</span></h3> \n<p>Hate-watching isn't really criticism — it's more like live-tweeting, as McGee noted. ""<span>Both are in-the-moment, performative reactions to a piece of pop culture that exist in parallel for a finite amount of time."" A defining feature of hate-watching is its immediacy. ""It's based as much around timezones as content,"" says McGee. </span></p> \n<p>In contrast, he says, ""criticism is inherently reflective, written out after an entire episode or series has aired."" He also notes that criticism aims to judge a piece for what it is, while hate-watching, on the other hand, judges a piece for what it isn't. A prime example of this would be the many tweets rightly pointing out the brazenly obvious fact that Carrie Underwood is not Julie Andrews. A critic<i> </i>might offer this as a tossed-off observation; for a hate-watcher, it could be the subject of many tweets.</p> \n<!--[if gte mso 9]><xml> 0   0   1   8   48   Vox Media   1   1   55   14.0 </xml><![endif]--> <!--[if gte mso 9]><xml> Normal   0               false   false   false      EN-US   JA   X-NONE </xml><![endif]--><!--[if gte mso 9]><xml> </xml><![endif]--> <!--[if gte mso 10]> \n<style> \n /* Style Definitions */ \ntable.MsoNormalTable \n\t{mso-style-name:""Table Normal""; \n\tmso-tstyle-rowband-size:0; \n\tmso-tstyle-colband-size:0; \n\tmso-style-noshow:yes; \n\tmso-style-priority:99; \n\tmso-style-parent:""""; \n\tmso-padding-alt:0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt; \n\tmso-para-margin:0in; \n\tmso-para-margin-bottom:.0001pt; \n\tmso-pagination:widow-orphan; \n\tfont-size:12.0pt; \n\tfont-family:Cambria; \n\tmso-ascii-font-family:Cambria; \n\tmso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin; \n\tmso-hansi-font-family:Cambria; \n\tmso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin;} \n</style> \n<![endif]--> <!--[if gte mso 9]><xml> 0   0   1   18   108   Vox Media   1   1   125   14.0 </xml><![endif]--> <!--[if gte mso 9]><xml> Normal   0               false   false   false      EN-US   JA   X-NONE </xml><![endif]--><!--[if gte mso 9]><xml> </xml><![endif]--> <!--[if gte mso 10]> \n<style> \n /* Style Definitions */ \ntable.MsoNormalTable \n\t{mso-style-name:""Table Normal""; \n\tmso-tstyle-rowband-size:0; \n\tmso-tstyle-colband-size:0; \n\tmso-style-noshow:yes; \n\tmso-style-priority:99; \n\tmso-style-parent:""""; \n\tmso-padding-alt:0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt; \n\tmso-para-margin:0in; \n\tmso-para-margin-bottom:.0001pt; \n\tmso-pagination:widow-orphan; \n\tfont-size:12.0pt; \n\tfont-family:Cambria; \n\tmso-ascii-font-family:Cambria; \n\tmso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin; \n\tmso-hansi-font-family:Cambria; \n\tmso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin;} \n</style> \n<![endif]--> \n<p>As for what good criticism is, it's even harder to answer that.</p> \n<p>Many brilliant theorists have grappled with this question for as long as there has been art to critique. One of the writers whose thoughts on the topic are most well-known is Alexander Pope, who penned <a href=""http://poetry.eserver.org/essay-on-criticism.html"" target=""_blank"">An Essay on Criticism</a><i> </i>in the early 18th-century. Here's how Pope begins his poem:</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>'Tis hard to say, if greater Want of Skill</p> \n<p>Appear in Writing or in Judging ill,</p> \n<p>But, of the two, less dang'rous is th' Offence,</p> \n<p>To tire our Patience, than mis-lead our Sense:</p> \n<p>Some few in that, but Numbers err in this,</p> \n<p>Ten Censure wrong for one who Writes amiss;</p> \n<p>A Fool might once himself alone expose,</p> \n<p>Now One in Verse makes many more in Prose.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<table> \n<tbody> \n<tr> \n</tr> \n</tbody> \n</table> \n<p>In these opening lines, Pope asks his reader which is worse: creating a bad work of art, or creating a bad work of criticism? For him, the first is ""less dangerous"" than the second, because it's harmless. We look at a bad piece of art and go, ""OK, that's bad."" And then we move on from it.</p> \n<p>Bad criticism, on the other hand, is harder to move on from since it has a way of informing our aesthetic sensibilities, which stick with us for life. In this way, hate-watching <i>can</i> function similarly to criticism.</p> \n<p>For example, <i>Peter Pan Live</i> could anticipate the hate-watchers, because <i>Sound of Music Live </i>became primarily <i>remembered</i> for all of those who hate-watched it. It's hard to think about <i>Sound of Music</i> without also thinking about the hate tweets. The hate-watching is more integral to the legacy of the show than the actual show.</p> \n<h3><span>You're being too tough on hate-watching!</span></h3> \n<p>Look, we're not saying hate-watching has no value, or that you should never do it. As James Poniewozik notes at <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://time.com/3620073/peter-pan-live-review-snark-hate-watching/"">Time</a>, there <i>is</i> a case to be made for snarky television-viewing — especially when the big bucks behind the network launch an offensive against the anticipated hate-watching. In response to Williams's anti-hate-watching pleas, Poniewozik had <a href=""http://time.com/3620073/peter-pan-live-review-snark-hate-watching/"" target=""_blank"">this</a> to say:</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>Spare me. ... I'm not going to blame anyone for going in skeptical of a production when NBC has cast the (very talented!) daughter of its news anchor as its lead, or when the network has been bludgeoningly promoting the musical across its specials, morning shows and talk shows for weeks.</p> \n<p>By all means, try to love things, … [but] when celebrities and already-powerful corporations inoculate themselves from criticism on the grounds of ""Haters gonna hate"" ... snark is not just permissible but a duty.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Rather than try to inoculate themselves in advance from hate-watchers, Poniewozik told me networks should prove those critics wrong. <span>""</span><span>Don't give your audience orders! Give them a production of a show good enough that they'll appreciate it uncynically on its own terms.""</span></p> \n<p>McGee, too, thinks producers and networks should pay attention to hate-watching since it offers a valuable and ""<span>broader perspective beyond the writer's room or a production meeting."" Sometimes a show's most loyal viewers are the hate-watchers, and it's probably a good idea that networks at least acknowledge them, says McGee.</span></p> \n<h3>I need a break.

Think about <i>Sharknado</i>, which celebrated its social media frenzy. Or most reality television. The producers funding these shows know people aren't tuning in to have their high-brow tastes appeased.</p> \n<p>What they want, on the other hand, is to see Ian Ziering cut his way through a fake-looking shark while delivering mindless one-liners.</p> \n<p>At the same time, a hate-watch product can't be <i>too</i> aware of its badness — it can't ""be in on the joke,"" or else it's a camp product, which is a different thing altogether. Emma Brockes noted this at <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/emma-brockes-column/2014/jul/31/peter-pan-sharknado-2-hate-watching"">The Guardian</a>: ""To succeed, a tiny, delusional part of those responsible [for the hate-watch product] must cling to the hope that they've made something good.""</p> \n<h3 id=""ql-line-732""></h3> \n<h3 id=""ql-line-734"">So why do people hate-watch shows?</h3> \n<p>Tough question! Tim Goodman wondered the same thing at the <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/bastard-machine/hate-watching-smash-is-latest-418392"">Hollywood Reporter</a>. How can you, he wonders, in addition to watching the shows that you actually like, ""<i>have enough time left over to hate watch a show </i>that mostly annoys you?""</p> \n<p><span></span><span>The answer is simple: because you don't actually hate the thing you claim to hate.</span></p> \n<p>That's the irony of hate-watching, as McGee told me: If you actually hate a show, you turn it off. ""<span>No one truly hatewatches something they actually hate,"" says McGee. ""What they hate is the execution, not the premise, which means that hatewatching is engaging with the potency of the idea versus the potency of its reality.""</span></p> \n<p>As McGee notes, not all hate-watching is necessarily motivated by malice. ""Hate-watching is really about how a certain episode or show or genre isn't living up to the high standards a viewer fairly or unfairly places upon that piece of pop culture.""</p> \n<p>In other words, hate-watching exists because shows that have jumped the shark exist. Those that hate-watch their way through <i>Smash</i> or <i>The Newsroom</i> do so because they're disappointed by all of that squandered potential.</p> \n<!--[if gte mso 9]><xml> 0   0   1   31   181   Vox Media   1   1   211   14.0 </xml><![endif]--> <!--[if gte mso 9]><xml> Normal   0               false   false   false      EN-US   JA   X-NONE </xml><![endif]--><!--[if gte mso 9]><xml> </xml><![endif]--> <!--[if gte mso 10]> \n<style> \n /* Style Definitions */ \ntable.MsoNormalTable \n\t{mso-style-name:""Table Normal""; \n\tmso-tstyle-rowband-size:0; \n\tmso-tstyle-colband-size:0; \n\tmso-style-noshow:yes; \n\tmso-style-priority:99; \n\tmso-style-parent:""""; \n\tmso-padding-alt:0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt; \n\tmso-para-margin:0in; \n\tmso-para-margin-bottom:.0001pt; \n\tmso-pagination:widow-orphan; \n\tfont-size:12.0pt; \n\tfont-family:Cambria; \n\tmso-ascii-font-family:Cambria; \n\tmso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin; \n\tmso-hansi-font-family:Cambria; \n\tmso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin;} \n</style> \n<![endif]--> \n<p>Madeleine Davies offers a different way to look at it over at <a href=""http://jezebel.com/5982222/hate-watching-is-mostly-just-being-embarrassed-by-your-own-tastes"" target=""_blank"">Jezebel</a>. Her hunch is that we secretly love the things we hate-watch, but, in order to ""protect ourselves and our street cred,"" we feel like we have to ""cloak our ... tastes in a layer of irony.""</p> \n<p>There might be another reason for at least some of the hate. According to <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://dctheatrescene.com/2013/12/06/reviewing-sound-music-live-hate-tweets/"">Dellaporta</a>, much of the backlash against <i>Sound of Music</i> and <i>Peter Pan</i> was voiced from within the theatre community itself.</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>People in the theatre community don't seem to respond well to ""stunt casting"", as it were. We're in a hard game, and I think it strikes a primal nerve when someone doesn't have to go through the struggle that we do.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<!--[if gte mso 9]><xml> 0   0   1   25   148   Vox Media   1   1   172   14.0 </xml><![endif]--> <!--[if gte mso 9]><xml> Normal   0               false   false   false      EN-US   JA   X-NONE </xml><![endif]--><!--[if gte mso 9]><xml> </xml><![endif]--> <!--[if gte mso 10]> \n<style> \n /* Style Definitions */ \ntable.MsoNormalTable \n\t{mso-style-name:""Table Normal""; \n\tmso-tstyle-rowband-size:0; \n\tmso-tstyle-colband-size:0; \n\tmso-style-noshow:yes; \n\tmso-style-priority:99; \n\tmso-style-parent:""""; \n\tmso-padding-alt:0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt; \n\tmso-para-margin:0in; \n\tmso-para-margin-bottom:.0001pt; \n\tmso-pagination:widow-orphan; \n\tfont-size:12.0pt; \n\tfont-family:Cambria; \n\tmso-ascii-font-family:Cambria; \n\tmso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin; \n\tmso-hansi-font-family:Cambria; \n\tmso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin;} \n</style> \n<![endif]--> \n<h3><span>Is there anything problematic about hate-watching?</span></h3> \n<p>In general, there's probably nothing wrong with hate-watching a show, so long as it's in good fun. But two notes of caution here.</p> \n<p>First, people who hate-watch a show often make up their minds that the show is a disaster before it even airs. <span>The question, then, is: are hate-watching audiences even open to having their minds changed? </span></p> \n<p><span>Poniewozik told me he doesn't like this question, since it ""depends on reading the minds of people who disagree with me. 'Those guys can't really believe this! They're just trying to hate it!' How do I really </span><i style=""font-size: 1.15em; line-height: 1.65;"">know</i><span> that?"" In other words, maybe all the people who hate-watch stuff </span><i style=""font-size: 1.15em; line-height: 1.65;"">genuinely, deep-down, for real</i><span> despise what they're seeing.</span></p> \n<p>At the same time, Poniewozik can see where that might be a problem. ""If you approach anything in life, entertainment or anything else, mainly from the standpoint of 'I am not going to be a sucker,' and you're preemptively dismissive of anything in advance so you can't be proved a sucker later ... yeah, that's sad.""</p> \n<p>Second, hate-watching ought to be undertaken in moderation, lest it become our default mode for watching things — both on and off-screen. A mind that is trained to look first for what's bad about something will probably have an easy time of finding what's bad about something. On the other hand, a mind trained to spot goodness … well, you get the idea.</p> \n<p>But, ultimately, Poniewozik told me, <span>""</span><span>I'm not sure that there's any less sincere enjoyment of actual good things in the world as a result"" of hate-watching.</span></p> \n<p>So have fun hate-watching, definitely. But don't forget to enjoy things in the process — and to realize that some deep, dark part of yourself that thinks it despises what you're watching right now might secretly love it. Like everybody else, you're complicated. Embrace it.</p> \n<!--[if gte mso 9]><xml> 0   0   1   16   94   Vox Media   1   1   109   14.0 </xml><![endif]--> <!--[if gte mso 9]><xml> Normal   0               false   false   false      EN-US   JA   X-NONE </xml><![endif]--><!--[if gte mso 9]><xml> </xml><![endif]--> <!--[if gte mso 10]> \n<style> \n /* Style Definitions */ \ntable.MsoNormalTable \n\t{mso-style-name:""Table Normal""; \n\tmso-tstyle-rowband-size:0; \n\tmso-tstyle-colband-size:0; \n\tmso-style-noshow:yes; \n\tmso-style-priority:99; \n\tmso-style-parent:""""; \n\tmso-padding-alt:0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt; \n\tmso-para-margin:0in; \n\tmso-para-margin-bottom:.0001pt; \n\tmso-pagination:widow-orphan; \n\tfont-size:12.0pt; \n\tfont-family:Cambria; \n\tmso-ascii-font-family:Cambria; \n\tmso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin; \n\tmso-hansi-font-family:Cambria; \n\tmso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin;} \n</style> \n<![endif]-->",Music

"How the CIA used music to ""break"" detainees",http://www.vox.com/2014/12/11/7375961/cia-torture-music,"How, and why, the CIA used some of America's most beloved, iconic songs as an instrument of torture.","<p>""Rolling, rolling, rolling,"" <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCRae5mRoRE"">Rawhide begins.</a> The song, originally recorded by Frankie Laine, was used as the intro music for television Westerns. In the Blues Brothers recording, the main vocals are a deep alto with a soulful, upbeat tone. Backup singers create a layering to the song that makes it impossible to know how many men are involved.</p> \n<p><em>""Don't try to understand 'em. Just rope, throw, and brand 'em. Soon we'll be livin' high and wide""</em></p> \n<p>The song ends with men cheering over the sound of a thrashing whip.</p> \n<p>The long-awaited Senate Intelligence Committee <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/12/9/7339753/senate-torture-report"">torture report</a> that was released to the public on Tuesday revealed some horrible <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/12/9/7360823/cia-torture-roundup"">physical torture </a>performed by the CIA — waterboarding, sleep deprivation, and sexual assault. But it also detailed the agency's use of ""sound disorientation techniques,"" as the report calls the music blared at detainees 24 hours a day. One of those was the Blues Brothers' ""Rawhide."" In a footnote, the report reveals:</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>'CIA records indicate that in the CIA interrogation of Ramzi bin al-Shibh...  ""the Blues Brothers rendition of 'Rawhide' [was] played."" CIA records state that bin al-Shibh's reaction to hearing the song was evidence of his conditioning, as bin al-Shibh ""knows when he heard the music where he is going and what is going to happen.""'</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>This is how, and why, the CIA used some of America's most beloved, iconic songs as an instrument of torture.</p> \n<h3>How the CIA used music to break prisoners</h3> \n<p>The report specifically mentions that music was used as a no-touch torture device at the COBALT detention facility. Detainees there, the report reads, ""were kept in complete darkness and constantly shackled in isolated cells with loud noise or music and only a bucket to use for human waste.""</p> \n<p>We know from past torture reports from Guantanamo Bay that this means the same song or album is often played on repeat at very loud volumes to keep detainees awake for hours on end. A <a href=""http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/sesame-street-songs-heavy-metal-blasted-torture-guantanamo-detainees-report-article-1.1088762"">2008 AP report</a> on prisoner conditions at Guantanamo Bay said that music was used ""to create fear, disorient . . . and prolong capture shock.""</p> \n<p>Not only was music used to  wear down an opponent until they were ""broken,"" but the CIA also, according to the report, used specific music as a trigger to a detainee that another interrogation was about to begin.</p> \n<p>""Rawhide"" is the only song the CIA report explicitly states was used as a torture technique. There wasn't, as far as we know, an formalized torture playlist. But in 2008, Justine Sharrock made a list of songs <a href=""http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2008/02/torture-playlist"">for Mother Jones</a> that she learned from ex-soldiers and detainees had been used against detainees. Here are a few of them:</p> \n<ul> \n<li> <strong>Dope:</strong> ""Die MF Die"", ""Take Your Best Shot""</li> \n<li> <strong>Eminem:</strong> ""White America"", ""Kim""</li> \n<li> <strong>Barney &amp; Friends:</strong> theme song</li> \n<li> <strong>Drowning Pool:</strong> ""Bodies""</li> \n<li> <strong>Metallica:</strong> ""Enter Sandman""</li> \n<li> <strong>Meow Mix:</strong> commercial jingle</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Sharrock, and reports by <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jun/19/usa.guantanamo"">The Guardian</a>, reveal that the two most common genres of music played for detainees are metal and country, because they are distinctly American genres. In clubs from Stockholm to Tel Aviv, Rihanna and Drake songs are played. Metal and country music simply don't have the kind of world-wide proliferation as pop, and that makes them foreign sounds for detainees.</p> \n<h3>Music connects you to your culture — or severs you from it</h3> \n<p>""It is music’s capacity to take over your mind and invade your inner experience that makes it so terrifying,"" Thomas Keenan, director of the Human Rights Project at Bard College, told <a href=""http://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/aljazeeraworld/2012/05/201253072152430549.html"">Al Jazeera</a>.</p> \n<p>Music, like many forms of art, is how we identify with our culture and our place in the world. Playing music that was intentionally American or foreign was intended to distance detainees from themselves and their culture, as well as to wear them down psychologically. By using mainly hard rock and metal music, detainees become inundated with sounds that are foreign to their ear and thus even more grating and isolating that something they might be better associated with.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""center"">These guys were dazed, dazzled and confused, bewildered, completely out of it</q></p> \n<p>""In a sense the music didn't bother me. I'd grown up in Britain, I knew what it was. But Afghan villagers, Yemenis, these guys were dazed, dazzled and confused, bewildered, completely out of it,"" Moazzam Begg, a British man who was arrested by the CIA in Pakistan in February 2002, <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.amazon.com/Enemy-Combatant-Imprisonment-Guantanamo-Kandahar/dp/B004L2KOIG"" style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.65;"">wrote in his memoir.</a></p> \n<p><a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.amazon.com/Enemy-Combatant-Imprisonment-Guantanamo-Kandahar/dp/B004L2KOIG"" style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.65;""></a>In addition, torturers used what has been called ""futility music"", like Barney's ""I love you"" and the song from the Meow Mix commercial—songs so upbeat and repetitive that they can be used to ""break"" prisoners into thinking that resistance is futile.</p> \n<p><em>I love you. You love me. We're a happy family. With a great big hug, and a kiss from me to you. Won't you say you love me too? </em></p> \n<p>""You almost have to stop yourself from laughing because you realize this is actually torture,"" Shaddock said to <a href=""http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2008/02/torture-playlist"">Mother Jones</a>.</p> \n<h3>The psychological effect of music torture</h3> \n<p>It's easy to slip into the mindset that torture by music is more of an irritant than a way of mentally abusing humans.</p> \n<p>As  Steve Asheim, the drummer for the death-metal band Deicide whose songs have been used at Guantanamo, told <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jun/19/usa.guantanamo"">the Guardian</a>: ""Look at it this way. These guys are not a bunch of high school kids. They are warriors, and they're trained to resist torture. They're expecting to be burned with torches and beaten and have their bones broken.

Everything you need to know about Nicki Minaj's new album â€” and her latest controversy,http://www.vox.com/2014/12/16/7381527/nicki-minaj-new-album,"""Anaconda"" isn't the best song on Minaj's new album, but ""Only"" isn't either.","<p>With her new album, <i>Pinkprint</i>, out Monday, Nicki Minaj dropped the highly anticipated video for her song ""Only,"" featuring Lil Wayne, Drake, and Chris Brown late last week. ""Only"" is the third single from the album.</p> \n<p><iframe frameborder=""0"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/zXtsGAkyeIo"" height=""480"" width=""853""></iframe></p> \n<p>The video takes place in an underground lair where Minaj reigns queen. Dressed like a dominatrix, she wields a whip and rules over the featured artists. The clear implication is that she beat up these men during some BDSM that presumably happened right before the video begins.</p> \n<p>Naturally, this has sparked some measure of controversy. Allow us to explain.</p> \n<h3>Wasn't there already some controversy about this song?</h3> \n<p>Yes! In November, Minaj released the lyrics video for ""Only,"" which depicted an authoritarian animated regime of which Minaj served as head. Like the music video, the lyrics video placed her in a position of badass power. Unlike the music video, it was culturally insensitive.</p> \n<p>Lyric videos are a fairly new thing in music. Now that a good portion of the American population consumes music online, it's to the studios' benefit to make it so an artist's audience can hear that music without having to pay for it.</p> \n<p>One way to do this is by creating a lyrics video — a pseudo-music-video that displays the lyrics from the song. Lyrics videos are cheaper and easier to make than music videos, so they give the studio time to win over the audience, while giving fans the music for free (on YouTube) <i>and</i> making money for the artist (with ads).</p> \n<p>This is the lyrics video for ""Only"":</p> \n<p><iframe frameborder=""0"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/BU769XX_dIQ"" height=""480"" width=""853""></iframe></p> \n<p>Because the imagery in the video looks strikingly similar to the red armbands and military regalia worn by Nazi soldiers in Hitler's Germany, many people reacted negatively to this video.</p> \n<p>""Nicki Minaj's new video disturbingly evokes Third Reich propaganda and constitutes a new low for pop culture's exploitation of Nazi symbolism,"" the Anti-Defamation League's director Abraham Foxman said in a <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://radaronline.com/exclusives/2014/11/nicki-minaj-only-nazi-video/"">statement</a> released on November 10.</p> \n<p>She later apologized for the video and its impact:</p> \n<blockquote class=""twitter-tweet"" lang=""en""> \n<p>I didn't come up w/the concept, but I'm very sorry &amp; take full responsibility if it has offended anyone. I'd never condone Nazism in my art.</p> \n— NICKI MINAJ (@NICKIMINAJ) <a href=""https://twitter.com/NICKIMINAJ/status/532153631588376576"">November 11, 2014</a>\n</blockquote> \n<p> \n<script src=""//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"" charset=""utf-8""></script> \n</p> \n<p><span>That said, controversy often drives intrigue. The lyrics video for ""Only"" has more than 21 million views. </span></p> \n<h3>So is the new video controversial?</h3> \n<p>Of course it is. The video seems to take place in some kind of underground torture chamber, which makes for horrible timing.  Last week, the Senate Committee released a report on the use of <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/12/9/7360823/cia-torture-roundup"">torture in the CIA</a>, which is — unfortunately — far, far, far more gruesome than this video.</p> \n<p>Also, Chris Brown's inclusion is a terrible idea.</p> \n<h3>Why?</h3> \n<p>Every shot of Brown in this video makes him look evil and menacing. He has contacts in to make his eyes look gold and reptilian, and his grill flashes beneath a menacing smile. But really, he looks terrifying because his personal history so easily <i>suggests</i> as much.</p> \n<p>In 2009, Chris Brown and Rihanna were in a relationship. They were out for a drive one day in February when Rihanna found a three-page text message from a woman Brown used to sleep with on his phone.</p> \n<p>Here's what the <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://i.cdn.turner.com/cnn/2009/images/03/05/brown.warrant.pdf"">police report</a> said. Note that Rihanna's legal first name is Robyn.</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>""A verbal argument ensued and Brown pulled the vehicle over on an unknown street, reached over Robyn F. with his right hand, opened the car door and attempted to force her out. Brown was unable to force Robyn F. out of the vehicle because she was wearing a seat belt. When he could not force her to exit, he took his right hand and shoved her head against he passenger window of the vehicle, causing an approximate one-inch raised circular contusion.</p> \n<p>Robyn F. turned to face Brown and he punched her in the left eye with his right hand. He then drove away in the vehicle and continued to punch her in the face with his right hand while steering the vehicle with his left hand. The assault caused Robyn F.'s mouth to fill with blood and blood to splatter all over her clothing and the interior of the vehicle.</p> \n<p>""Brown looked at Robyn F. and stated, ‘I'm going to beat the sh- out of you when we get home! You wait and see!'""</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>The altercation escalated. Pictures of Rihanna with a bruised and swollen face surfaced quickly. Brown later said that he was seeking help, but the long and short of it is that Brown's enrollment in a therapy group was the only real attempt to atone for his behavior he's managed. The incident will always hang over people's perceptions of him.</p> \n<p>Brown was later charged with felony assault and sentenced to a five-year probation and a restraining order. It all amounted to a slap on the hand. That's why it is such a strange and scary choice to portray him as a terrifying figure in this music video.</p> \n<h3>Why are there so many featured artists here?</h3> \n<p>In ""Only,"" Minaj only (ha!) sings the first verse. The chorus is sung by Brown, and the second and third verses are sung by Lil Wayne and Drake, respectively. This is surprisingly common in rap music.  As more and more artists try to make their music known to the general public, rap music, in particular, is seeing more and more featured artists on albums in order to provide diversity in terms of melody and musical approaches. That diversity helps songs on their way up the top 40 charts.</p> \n<p><b></b><span>For instance, take Iggy Azalea's ""Fancy,"" one of the biggest songs of the year and the first rap song to spend so much time in the Billboard no. 1 slot. ""Fancy"" may have Azalea's name at the top, but the most famous parts of the song (the chorus and the bridge) are sung by featured artist Charli XCX.</span></p> \n<p>As a low-level artist, having multiple artists on a record is a bad move, because you have to split up any profits into smaller and smaller pieces. But for artists with huge fanbases, working together can make a rap song more popular, potentially propelling it into the top 10.</p> \n<p><i>Pinkprint</i> is a prime example of the featured artist trend. In addition to ""Only,"" the album includes songs featuring Skylar Grey, Ariana Grande, and Beyoncé.</p> \n<h3>What's up with all the relationship references in the song?</h3> \n<p><span>""I never fucked Wayne / I never fucked Drake / On my life, man / Fuck's sake,"" Nicki raps at the beginning of ""Only."" This rhyme is an attempt to clear up rumors that have circulated that she is involved with Drake or Lil Wayne. Wayne backs her up in his verse saying </span><span>""I never fucked Nick / And that's fucked up / If I did fuck / She'd be fucked up.""</span></p> \n<p>By addressing the issue head-on, though, Minaj gets to have it both ways: she claims not to be having sex with either of them while maintaining the public interest in that rumor. Part of Minaj's persona is that she puts out so much ""information"" in the form of rumors and public appearances that she has managed to keep her <i>actual </i>personal life fairly private. This album is in keeping with that. <i>Pinkprint </i>is one of the most personal albums she has released, and even it only deals with the rumors swirling around Minaj's sex life.</p> \n<p>One of the unaddressed rumors in the song, though, is the Drake-versus-Brown feud. Drake, who dated Rihanna for a while, and Brown have a tumultuous, fairly violent history. In June 2012, the two brawled at the same nightclub in New York, ostensibly after Drake taunted Brown about his relationship with Rihanna.</p> \n<p>Maybe brawl is an understatement. Here's a photo from after the fight:</p> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2547314/a9ehsq3ck7q8s7fcb14i.0.jpg"" alt=""drake/chrisbrown fight"" data-chorus-asset-id=""2547314""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Instagram/<a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/chris-brown-bodyguard-suing-drake-w-p-brawl-article-1.1312358"" style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.65;"">NY Daily News</a></p> \n<h3>Is Drake in love with Nicki?</h3> \n<p>Well, his lyrics in the song are certainly meant for the audience to believe he is in love with Minaj:</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>""I never fucked Nicki cause she got a man/<br>But when that's over then I'm first in line/<br>And the other day in her Maybach/<br>I thought god damn, this is the perfect time""</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>But all of this plays into an ongoing narrative in which Drake plays an eager-to-please puppy who is desperate for love but can't get it. Take his appearance in Minaj's  ""Anaconda,"" which is probably <i>Pinkprint</i>'s best single so far:</p> \n<p><iframe width=""853"" height=""480"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/LDZX4ooRsWs"" frameborder=""0""></iframe></p> \n<p>Ultimately, Drake's relationship with Nicki is portrayed the way much of Drake's career has been portrayed. He's a sweet guy who can't get the girl, despite the fact that he continually puts out some of the best rhymes in the business.</p> \n<h3>Is ""Only"" the best song off of <i>Pinkprint</i>?</h3> \n<p>No. There are several much catchier songs, as well as tracks that have better rhymes and are more musically complex than ""Only."" What's great about <i>Pinkprint</i> as an album, though, is easily seen in the way ""Only"" is mixed. Minaj isn't afraid to address her personal life in this song, and that's a huge shift for an artist who wears pink wigs and uses a fake name. Minaj's work has been technically superior but superficial thus far. <i>Pinkprint </i>takes a huge step forward.</p> \n<p>Like ""Only,"" <i>Pinkprint </i>is also an album full of featured artists. On half of the songs, Minaj sings with another artist, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. The outright swagger that dominated her past albums is paired with beautiful melodies by pop artists like Skylar Grey and Beyoncé, and that contrast allows Minaj's tight rhymes to really stand out.  This pairing allows <i>Pinkprint</i> to be Minaj's most emotional album, even in its weak spots.</p> \n<p><i>Pinkprint</i> feels like a transitional album. It's not quite hip-hop, not quite full pop, and not quite full Nicki Minaj. That said, Minaj's technical prowess shines through. She is, hands down, one of the best rappers in the game — someone who can keep lyrics coming at an astonishing pace while never sacrificing your ability to perfectly understand every word.</p> \n<p><i>Pinkprint</i> might not be Minaj's most iconic work so far, but it's an obvious stepping stone. The best songs, such as ""All Things Go "" and ""Get on Your Knees,"" are powerful, terrific anthems that cement Minaj's place in the public consciousness. This album might be a transitional one, but it feels like Minaj is transitioning to something amazing.</p>",Music

The album, <i>Beyoncé, </i>included more than a dozen perfectly executed music videos. Now, on the anniversary of that album drop, Beyoncé has released a 12-minute video using clips from those videos, but overlaid with her voice talking about her personal life, her childhood, and her beliefs. ""I  have dreams,"" Beyoncé says, ""and I feel like I have the power to actually make those dreams become a reality.""</p> \n<p>In the video, Queen Bey talks about the hardships she had to overcome to get to her dreams. She also spends a solid two minutes talking about her beliefs about life and her hopes for women:</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>""I consider myself a feminist even though I was always afraid of that word because people put so much on it. When honestly, it's very simple, I'm a person who believes in equality for men and women. Men and women balance each other out and we have to get to a point where we are comfortable appreciating each other. I have a lot of empathy for men and the pressures that they go through, and the cultures that have been created—especially for African American men. I have the same empathy for women, and the pressures that we go through.  ""</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>The video is called  ""Yours &amp; Mine,"" and it features a lot of the same narratives as her documentary, but the music video background adds an artier, more personal feel to her words. ""You can't put your finger on who I am,"" Beyonce says. ""I can't put my finger on who I am. I'm complicated."" She's damn right.</p>",Music
"After almost 15 years, D'Angelo is back and he's as good as ever",http://www.vox.com/2014/12/15/7394841/dangelo-black-messiah,Why was everybody so excited about an album from someone who hasn't released one in 15 years?,"<p>For fans of R&amp;B and Soul — hell, for fans of music — the surprise drop of D'Angelo's first album in almost 15 years today is Christmas come early. Fans have waited since 2000's cult-classic <i style=""line-height: 28.4624996185303px;"">Voodoo </i> for D'Angelo for a new release. Then on Friday, without any other warning, the artist announced that <i>Black Messiah </i>was coming. The internet broke.</p> \n<p>But why was everybody so excited about an album from someone who hasn't released one in 15 years? Here's everything you need to know:</p> \n<h3>Who is D'Angelo?</h3> \n<p><a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.nndb.com/people/715/000086457/"" style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.65;"">Michael Eugene Archer</a> is an R&amp;B singer and producer who goes by the stage name D'Angelo. He signed to a <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.allmusic.com/artist/dangelo-mn0000134600"">record label</a> at 18, and produced his first major album, <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://open.spotify.com/album/1Owp8VOaFEk4r7zkvGOHmE""><i>Brown Sugar</i></a><i>,</i> in 1995 at the age of 22. The album debuted at no. 6 on the R&amp;B charts. Afterward, D'Angelo took a four-year hiatus, and returned with <i>Voodoo </i>in 2000. <i><a target=""_blank"" href=""http://open.spotify.com/album/1ecv8bJajqX9E0EOX2g3eI"">Voodoo</a> </i>quickly established a <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/music/scdangel-00.php"">following</a> for the artist, and the <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.billboard.com/#/news/billboard-bits-d-angelo-will-smith-q-tip-871348.story"">Voodoo tour</a> was one of the most highly attended of 2000.</p> \n<h3>Why do people love him so much?</h3> \n<p>Mostly because he's great. <span>D'Angelo's sound has been compared to Prince and Marvin Gaye. He's considered one of the foremost voices in the neo-soul movement for his dreamy, melodic songs, filled with humming keyboard lines and lyrical twists. He brought soul music back into the Billboard Top 100, and made room for more soulful pop music from artists like Justin Timberlake. </span></p> \n<p>Also, the long wait between albums allowed D'Angelo to obtain a kind of mythic quality. Because he doesn't produce albums quickly, he was able to maintain a quality in his work, thus releasing this album to a slew of excitement.</p> \n<h3>What's so great about <i>Black Messiah</i>?</h3> \n<p>D'Angelo doesn't release light and fluffy pop albums. He likes to say something about society. He spoke about the inspiration behind the album and the title in a <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/12/14/dangelo-releases-first-album-in-15-years/?_r=0"" style=""font-size: 17px; line-height: 28.4624996185303px; background-color: #ffffff;"">statement</a> saying:</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>""<i>Black Messiah</i> is a hell of a name for an album. It can be easily misunderstood. Many will think it's about religion. Some will jump to the conclusion that I'm calling myself a Black Messiah. It's about people rising up in Ferguson and in Egypt and in Occupy Wall Street and in every place where a community has had enough and decided to make change happen... <span>Not every song on this album is politically charged (though many are), but calling this album ‘Black Messiah' creates a landscape where those songs can live to the fullest.""</span></p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>On top of the political basis for the album, D'Angelo is just a great musician. People like his work because it's well-produced and masterfully performed.</p> \n<p>It would have been easy for D'Angelo to disappoint after 14 years away. After all, that makes it easier for his audience to build up unrealistic expectations.</p> \n<p>But <i>Black Messiah</i> is an album that will force critics to rearrange their top 10 lists for the year. The bass is heavy and thick, the drums ricochet, and D'Angelo's voice is more mature — scratchier, heavier, and tougher — than it was in the past. Take a look at tracks like ""Really Love,"" which combine hints of Spanish guitar riffs, layered echoing, and a thumping heartbeat of a bass line to create a song that places D'Angelo right where he left off — in the upper echelons of R&amp;B and soul.</p> \n<h3>What has the response been?</h3> \n<p><span>It's too early to make final judgements on whether the 15-year wait was worth is, but </span><i style=""line-height: 28.4624996185303px;"">Black Messiah </i><span>is already beloved by plenty.

"""All I Want for Christmas Is You"" â€” and to have this song explained",http://www.vox.com/2014/12/23/7435265/mariah-carey-christmas,The Mariah Carey classic is the greatest Christmas song written in the last 25 years.,"<p>""All I Want for Christmas Is You"" is the greatest Christmas song written in the last 25 years — and the most popular, too.</p> \n<p>It is one of a handful of late 20th century songs readily accepted into the Christmas canon, and it's almost universally praised by critics for its bouncing chords and Mariah Carey's pristine vocal technique. With its upbeat melody, ""All I Want for Christmas Is You"" combines the nostalgia of Christmastime cheer with the popularity of a great love song.</p> \n<p>But how did it get to be such a standard of the season? Here's everything you need to know:</p> \n<h3>1. How popular is this song?</h3> \n<p>The only reason ""All I Want for Christmas Is You"" never hit number one on the Billboard Top 40 is because of poor planning on the part of Carey's record label. The song was never released as a single in 1994 (the year of its release and height of its popularity), and, thus, it could never hit the top of the charts. Understandably, sales for Christmas songs and albums drop steeply after the holiday. That Top 40 pinnacle, however, is probably the only major popular milestone that the song hasn't crushed.</p> \n<p><em>Merry Christmas</em>, the album the song is buried on, is the ninth best-selling holiday album of all time. Every single year since the Billboard holiday chart — which includes airplay, sales, and (as of this year) streaming — was introduced in 2011, ""All I Want for Christmas is You"" has settled snugly at the top. This year, it hit no. 1 in the second week of December, topping both age-old classics and Ariana Grande's new release ""<a href=""http://open.spotify.com/track/0lizgQ7Qw35od7CYaoMBZb"">Santa Tell Me</a>."" In terms of Christmas sales, Carey is the Queen Bee.</p> \n<h3>2. Can I listen to the original song as a refresher?</h3> \n<p>Of course. Here's Mariah Carey in the original music video made in 1994.</p> \n<p><iframe width=""640"" height=""480"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/yXQViqx6GMY"" frameborder=""0""></iframe></p> \n<p>There were actually three music videos made for this song because that's how popular it is. This is the first one. Here is the second video:<span> </span></p> \n<p><iframe frameborder=""0"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/pA8UHeoYHQM"" height=""480"" width=""640""></iframe></p> \n<p>We'll get to the third video in a bit.</p> \n<h3>3. What's the story behind the song?</h3> \n<p>Carey made this song as a part of the aforementioned <em>Merry Christmas</em>, a 12-song album<em>. Merry Christmas</em> was, at the time, a strange choice for Carey. She was a young, rising star and Christmas albums in the early 90s were mostly being made by stars past their prime. The fact that ""All I Want for Christmas is You"" wasn't released as a single, means that her label wasn't particularly impressed with the song, if not the entire album. They were wrong.<strong> </strong>Popular artists make <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/11/28/7296783/holiday-albums-explained"">Christmas albums</a> every year, despite the existence of so many other Christmas albums. These albums are perennial hits. They make artists a ton of money, selling copies year after year when the holiday season rolls around.</p> \n<p>But Carey has also said that she made the album because of a deep and long-lasting love of Christmas. She said in <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Mariah-Carey-Revisited-Unauthorized-Biography-ebook/dp/B005E8AG5W/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1418927374&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=Mariah+Carey+revisited%3A+her+story"">Chris Nickson's biography</a> of her:</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>""I'm a very festive person and I love the holidays. I've sung Christmas songs since I was a little girl. I used to go Christmas caroling. ... When it came to the album, we had to have a nice balance between standard Christian hymns and fun songs. It was definitely a priority for me to write at least a few new songs, but for the most part, people really want to hear the standards at Christmastime, no matter how good a new song is.""</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>""All I Want"" is also, ostensibly, about Carey's husband at the time, Tommy Mottola, adding an emotional component to the song's composition.</p> \n<h3>4. Who wrote the song?</h3> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""2496392"" alt=""Mariah Carey"" src=""https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2496392/mariah.0.jpg""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Mariah Carey performs a Christmas concert (Paul Morigi/Getty)</p> \n<p>Walter Afanasieff and Carey herself co-wrote ""All I Want for Christmas is You."" <a href=""http://nypost.com/2014/12/13/8-things-you-didnt-know-about-all-i-want-for-christmas-is-you/"">Legend</a> has it that the two cranked out the entire song in a burst of creative inspiration that left them, after just 15 minutes, with the complete song.</p> \n<p>""To me, it's kind of a cosmic occurrence that happens once every five billion years,"" Afanasieff <a href=""http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/6296926/mariah-carey-merry-christmas-anniversary-all-i-want-for-christmas"">told <em>Billboard</em></a> in October. ""We feel lucky, because it was the last major song to enter that Christmas canon. Then the door slammed shut. [Although] I'm sure there's going to be another one; there has to be.""</p> \n<p>There was another song also titled ""<a href=""http://open.spotify.com/track/5WBDqBgGq7LKj38J0QUETf"" target=""_blank"">All I Want for Christmas is You</a>"" performed by Vince Vance and the Valiants and sung by Lynda Lyle five years before Carey made the title famous. Though the two songs bear the same title— and idea of wanting your loved one for Christmas — they have very different melodies and lyrics and entirely different copyrights. There is no evidence that the 1989 song influenced Mariah Carey's version.</p> \n<h3>5. Why do people love the song so much?</h3> \n<p>For one thing, people just love Mariah Carey. In her prime, Carey's absurd vocal range allowed her to hit one of the highest notes ever produced by a human being (the G-sharp located three-and-a-half octaves above middle C). She also holds the record for the most No. 1 songs in history, ahead of Elvis and the Beatles.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""center"">""To me, it's kind of a cosmic occurrence that happens once every five billion years""</q></p> \n<p>But it's not just Carey. The song itself is great — well-written and well-produced. It's a truly magnificent Christmas song.</p> \n<p>As <a href=""http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/music_box/2014/12/mariah_carey_s_all_i_want_for_christmas_is_you_a_musicological_explanation.html"">Adam Ragusa</a> argued for Slate, ""All I Want for Christmas is You"" <em>sounds </em>like a classic. ""'All I Want for Christmas is You' does more than subtly evoke memories of Judy Garland and Nat King Cole’s Christmases gone by. It sounds more like it could have been written in that era and locked in a Brill Building safe that wasn’t cracked again until 1994, when Carey needed a new song for her Christmas album,"" he wrote.</p> \n<p>Ragusa counted 13 different chords in Carey's song, which is something completely unheard of in modern rock and pop, where most songs have three or four chords. That makes the song sound much, much older than it actually is. Thus, it subconsciously influences you into thinking you're listening to a Christmas standard.</p> \n<h3>6. Has the song been in the news lately?</h3> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""2871496"" alt=""mariah carey 2014"" src=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2871496/mariah_carey.0.jpg""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Mariah Carey at the82nd Annual Rockefeller Christmas Tree Lighting  ( Paul Zimmerman/Getty)</p> \n<p>Yes. Carey's famous vocal range has faded as she has aged. On December 3, she performed the song at the tree-lighting ceremony at New York's Rockefeller Center. When it was time for her performance, Carey arrived late. That late arrival might be why, when a video emerged with her <a href=""http://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/mariah-carey-isolated-rockefeller-center-vocals-leaked-2014412"">vocals isolated</a>, she sounded terrible.</p> \n<p>In the viral video, Carey is off-tempo and can't hit the high notes she is so well-known for. This could have been due to a lack of warm-up time or bad noise reduction on stage. Or Carey could have lost some of the notes in her upper-register due to vocal decay, age, or a combination of both. Many fans tried to write off Carey for her performance. This is a little unfair to Carey as an artist. On one hand, audiences are notably critical of live performances, and for Carey to flop on her biggest hit is embarrassing. On the other hand, live performances have become such a hotbed of criticism that artists might feel like they need to use heavy backing tracks and back-up singers instead of simply adjusting the range of the song as they might have done in the past.</p> \n<h3>7. Is that the only controversy with this song?</h3> \n<p>Nope! In 2011, at the height of Justin Bieber's fame, he and Carey recorded a remixed version of the song for his Christmas album, <em>Under the Mistletoe. </em>In the opening sequence for the music video, Carey stands with her leg bent against the wall, wearing a two-piece elf costume that shows part of her upper abdomen. When Bieber strolls around the corner, staring open-mouthed at Carey, she winks at him.</p> \n<p><iframe width=""853"" height=""480"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/fGFNmEOntFA"" frameborder=""0""></iframe></p> \n<p>The two barely interact at all during the duet, but the age difference (Carey was 41 and Bieber was 17) was enough to get people angry about both the seductive nature of the song and the over-the-top objectification of an older woman by a young male pop star.</p> \n<h3>8. What are some popular covers of the song?</h3> \n<p>As with any popular Christmas song, ""All I Want for Christmas Is You"" has been covered many times. Since 1994, dozens have covered the song, including Shania Twain, Miley Cyrus, Michael Bublé, Cee Lo Green, and Fifth Harmony.</p> \n<p>Because of the way<a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/11/3/7145231/shows-not-on-dvd-music-rights-wonder-years-wkrp""> music licensing</a> works, any artists can cover any song for a flat fee and gain their own performance copyright. Thus, they can collect royalties from a song that has already been created, while Carey and Afanasieff are paid for the songwriting copyright. Thus, the frequent covers of the song are also beneficial to Carey and Afanasieff. It's hard to say if this is the most lucrative song Carey has ever been associated with, but it has to be near the top of that list.</p> \n<h3>9. What's the best version of the song?</h3> \n<p>Carey's original version remains the best. But if you're looking for a cover to mix up your Christmas playlist a little bit, you can't go wrong with Ariana Grande's cover. After all, she's a baby Mariah:</p> \n<p><iframe width=""853"" height=""480"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/XugW9ya99qo"" frameborder=""0""></iframe></p>",Music

It's more of a performance piece, but it's also kind of  something else.</p> \n<h3 id=""ql-line-18"">1) Annie v. Annie</h3> \n<p id=""ql-line-20"">Annie B.'s piece is quite different from her predecessor's. B's piece is fun. Engaging. Hard-knock — literally. At once, B has the entire classroom participating in her show, assigning different hand and feet rhythms for them to perform. <i>Stomp stompstomp</i>, they pound, as B tells them about life in 1932, which, as she describes it, sounds incredibly similar to life in 2014.</p> \n<p id=""ql-line-27"">The bell rings, B looks to her teacher and smiles, and he congratulates her. ""Good job, Annie,"" he says, this time, however, leaving off the B, the letter that differentiated her from her classmate of the same name. The message is clear: Wallis is no longer Annie <i>B</i>. — she's Annie.</p> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""2873116"" alt=""Annie 1"" src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2873116/annie-2014-stills-wallpapers.0.jpg""></p> \n<div style=""text-align:center""> \n<p class=""caption"">Quvenzhané Wallis and Marti. (Columbia Pictures)</p> \n</div> \n<div style=""text-align:center""> \n<div class=""align-left""></div> \n<br>\n</div> \n<p id=""ql-line-36"">Obviously the ""B"" stands for Annie's last name, Bennett. But you can't but wonder if something else is going on here.</p> \n<p>For the opening scene of his 2014 Annie, director Will Gluck decided that what was most appropriate was to stage a kind of battle between two Annies. It was the Annie we know from previous versions of this story versus a brand-new Annie. It was time-step Annie versus step squad Annie.</p> \n<p id=""ql-line-38"">This kind of racial diversity in a classic story could be welcome, and there's a rich tradition of kids stories looking at complex, adult issues through a young person's lens. But Gluck has to underline and highlight exactly what he's doing, via the very literal battle between two different Annies, rather than letting the story simply <i>be</i>.</p> \n<p id=""ql-line-45"">There's a clever idea here — the Annie we knew, the one from 1932, doesn't have to be all that different from one from 2014 — but it gets lost in Gluck's tendency to overemphasize points that are already obvious to anyone watching. Everyone involved in the film is giving themselves too much credit for something that probably doesn't deserve such heavy-handed back-patting.</p> \n<p id=""ql-line-47"">And because this was the first scene of the movie, it had a creepy way of framing the entire story. This is an update of <i>Annie</i> that tries so hard at every turn to remind us we're watching an updated version that it occasionally seems embarrassed to be based on the musical <i>Annie</i> at all.</p> \n<h3 id=""ql-line-63"">2) Unfortunate casting choices</h3> \n<p id=""ql-line-65"">Part of that updating, unfortunately, involves the casting, which is all over the map.</p> \n<p id=""ql-line-67"">Let's start with what works. Wallis is fantastic. Already Oscar-nominated for her work in <i>Beasts of the Southern Wild</i>, her amazing performance in <i>Annie</i> will hopefully launch her to many well-deserved roles. Though she's not really a singer, per se, as David Edelstein<b> </b>points out at <a href=""http://www.vulture.com/2014/12/movie-review-annie.html"">Vulture</a>, the film's several body percussion moments make clear she has a natural gift for rhythm, though we don't really know if she can actually dance.</p> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""2873126"" alt=""Annie 2"" src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2873126/Annie-Movie-Pictures-2014.0.jpg""></p> \n<div style=""text-align:center""> \n<p class=""caption"">Rose Byrne and Quvenzhané Wallis. (Columbia Pictures)</p> \n</div> \n<p><span>Byrne, incidentally, is also wonderful as Grace. But, then, the actress usually is. She finds ways to capture a laughs in the most minor movement of her face. She also deserves praise for finding a way to bring Grace into 2014 without stripping her of any of her throwback elegance.</span></p> \n<p id=""ql-line-115"">It's the rest of the cast where the problems lie. Jamie Foxx is a wonderful, engaging actor, but this might not have been the role for him. His natural charm actually works against him. Will Stacks (this version's spin on Daddy Warbucks) needs to be appropriately standoffish, but the moments he needs to seem genuinely put off by Annie come across, instead, as playful — as if he and his young co-star were just being sarcastic with each other.</p> \n<p id=""ql-line-117"">But whereas Foxx and Byrne are at least fun to watch and genuinely capable of pulling off at least some version of the characters they're updating, Cameron Diaz and Bobby Cannavale are out of place. The problem with Cannavale might have been how the role was written. His character, a dirty political advisor to Stacks, is a strange addition to the script, particularly since Rooster, the character from the original <i>Annie</i> that this new one replaces, would have been a great fit for Cannavale's talents.</p> \n<p id=""ql-line-124"">As for Diaz, in the iconic Ms. Hannigan role: WHY? It's hard to know what anyone was thinking here. What Diaz does here is reminiscent of karaoke. That doesn't mean she's phoning it in. Rather, she's doing her best Ms. Hannigan impression, instead of finding her own spin on the character. She doesn't so much perform a character as act out adjectives: mean, belligerent, drunk, grumpy.</p> \n<p id=""ql-line-126"">These actors were stuck into the movie as an insurance policy, it would seem, in case audiences didn't warm to Wallis. But this version switches their characters (save Ms. Hannigan, oddly) around in ways that rarely work. Those forced updates rear their head again.</p> \n<h3>3) The film feels just so damn forced</h3> \n<p id=""ql-line-130"">The pointless updating extends to the film's music. There's nothing wrong with reworking the score of <i>Annie</i> - as this film does - but too often, the movie seems a little embarrassed to be a musical at all, making it seem as if it's having a crisis of confidence. For instance, every time a song was updated by synth drums or auto-tune, it's not hard to think that the director wants the audience to know that this version is cooler and better than the classic they're used to.</p> \n<p id=""ql-line-137"">Most of the updates - to the story, as well as the music - don't seem honest. Sure, some are authentic to Annie's contemporary world. It makes sense that Stacks would track Annie's location at the end of the film with help from social media, and updating Annie's back-story so she's in foster care, rather than an orphanage, is also thoughtful.</p> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""2873132"" alt=""Annie 3"" src=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2873132/o-ANNIE-CAMERON-DIAZ-facebook.0.jpg""></p> \n<div style=""text-align:center""> \n<p class=""caption"">Cameron Diaz. (Columbia Pictures)</p> \n</div> \n<p>But many changes here — the mashups of classic Annie songs and Australian pop, the decision to replace all the dancing with choreographed Moving From Here To There — were awkward to sit through, because they just mostly seem like desperate attempts to make a deliberately uncool musical cool. (C'mon. <i>Annie</i> is based on a comic strip from the '30s. It's the opposite of hip.) Even when the new songs were welcome in the moment or the scene — like Sia's beautiful ""Who Am I?"" — they still felt out of place in the overall picture.</p> \n<p>All musical remakes will inevitably be faced with the question of how they compare with their source material. That is usually a productive question to ask. Times change, and stories need to be able to shift along with them.</p> \n<p id=""ql-line-148"">And there are the seeds of a good idea here, especially with Wallis in the title role. As Imran Siddiquee points out in a great piece at <a href=""http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2014/12/why-a-black-annie-is-so-significant/383894/?single_page=true"">The Atlantic</a>, just having Wallis playing <i>this </i>role is a wonderful idea. People of color continue to be underrepresented in Hollywood, and casting Wallis in a role previously best known for bright red curls is a welcome suggestion that somebody somewhere in show business is getting the message about diversity.</p> \n<p id=""ql-line-164"">And that diversity is one of the things the film does incredibly well! The love story between Stacks and Grace was wonderful to see, and there's real power in the kiss they share at the end of the film. Creating art that represents our diverse planet is absolutely necessary, and it's refreshing to see that reflected in a children's film.</p> \n<p id=""ql-line-166"">But making art and forcing art are different things. And notwithstanding its many positive takeaways, the new <i>Annie</i> is forced at every turn, desperate to please a modern audience while losing sight of how the boldest update — and maybe the only update needed here — was the girl in the title role. She doesn't need to be Annie ""B."" She can be Annie, full stop.</p>",Music

Tired of the classic Christmas hymns? Try these.,http://www.vox.com/2014/12/24/7443689/christmas-music,Here are some of our favorite indie-rock Christmas carols,"<p>Christmas music tends to be pretty tame, with most bands opting to do straightforward covers of the same small repertoire of seasonal classics. But some still manage to make holiday songs memorable. Here are some of our favorite indie-rock Christmas carols:</p> \n<p><strong>""Jesus Christ"" by Big Star</strong></p> \n<p>Kicking off this playlist is Big Star, an early 1970s power pop band that became a cult favorite after being hopelessly ahead of their time. ""Jesus Christ"" is an emotive, lifting song about the birth of the Christian savior, and it also has some really fun harmonies.</p> \n<p><strong>""Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas"" by Sufjan Stevens</strong></p> \n<p>No indie-rock Christmas playlist is complete without a pick from Sufjan Stevens's <em>Silver &amp; Gold</em>. ""Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas""  has some gentle reed instruments in the background and sounds like it's sung by a whole family of merry hipsters.</p> \n<p><strong>""Silver Bells"" by Bright Eyes</strong></p> \n<p>Conor Oberst's quiet voice is normally the focal point of any Bright Eyes song, but on the band's <em>A Christmas Album</em> sixteen different people contribute vocals, which gives this horn-backed version of Bing Crosby's classic a choral quality that slowly descends into chaos by the end.</p> \n<p><strong>""Green Grows The Holly"" by Calexico</strong></p> \n<p>Joey Burns and John Convertino of Tucson, Arizona based Calexico smartly build up their choruses here with major chord progressions and horns to allow the quieter, calmer verses to mount with anticipation.</p> \n<p><strong>""Frosty the Snowman"" by Fiona Apple</strong></p> \n<p>Fiona Apple had a great 2014 with ""Container,"" the theme song for the Showtime series <em>The Affair</em>. On this track, Apple's warbling voice is full of something that isn't normally present in her work — genuine excitement.</p> \n<p><strong>""Rockin' Around The Christmas Tree"" by She &amp; Him</strong></p> \n<p>Zooey Deschanel already cemented her place in the Christmas canon with her performance in <em>Elf, </em>but her voice had matured by the creation of 2011's <em>A Very She &amp; Him Christmas. </em>On ""Rockin' Around The Christmas Tree,"" she's playful, boisterous, and simply great.</p> \n<p><strong>""Christmas Must Be Tonight"" by Bahamas</strong></p> \n<p>The twangy guitar and thumping bass of ""Christmas Must Be Tonight"" let The Band's lyrics (as covered by Bahamas) take center stage here.</p> \n<p><strong>""Just Like Christmas"" by Low</strong></p> \n<p>This track have a dreary, wintery quality to it, built out of minor chords and the tinkling of jingle bells in the background. ""The beds were small but we felt so young / It was just like Christmas,"" Mimi Parker sings, convincingly evoking the nostalgia of the holiday season.</p> \n<p><strong>""Joy To The World"" by Seabird</strong></p> \n<p>Indie-rock with a hint of Kentucky bluegrass guitar, Seabird brings a slower, more passionate voice to what is normally one of the most upbeat and celebratory Christmas carols. When Aaron Morgan reaches a falsetto to sing ""Repeat the sounding joy,"" it gives me chills.</p> \n<p><strong>""December"" by Regina Spektor</strong></p> \n<p>""Rumors have started that you are in love again/ Rumors that are completely unsubstantiated,"" Regina Spektor sings in her Russian-accented soprano voice on ""December."" This song, though at times it feels like a modernist mixtape, draws out one of the hardest things about the Christmas season — its focus on romantic love, whether you get to experience it or not.</p> \n<p><strong>""Wonderful Christmastime"" by The Shins</strong></p> \n<p>The Shins sound genuinely happy on their cover of ""Wonderful Christmastime,"" and when they work in a children's choir, The Shins really shine.</p> \n<p><strong>""I Heard the Bells On Christmas Day"" by The Civil Wars</strong></p> \n<p>I am still personally mourning the break-up of indie-folk rock group The Civil Wars earlier this year. In their rendition of ""I Heard the Bells On Christmas Day,"" Joy Williams and John Paul White sing slightly off from one another, giving the song a discordant, almost anxious quality that builds into a beautiful, soothing harmony.</p> \n<p><strong>""It's Christmas So We'll Stop"" by Frightened Rabbit</strong></p> \n<p>This playlist could go on and on forever with great indie Christmas covers, but ""It's Christmas So We'll Stop"" with this original song by Scottish-rock band Frightened Rabbit:</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>Oh it's Christmas so we stopped</p> \n<p>Were it not for the tick of the clock</p> \n<p>And the spinning of the Earth in space</p> \n<p>We could always be this way</p> \n<p>And as we sleep at the fall of the day</p> \n<p>In the room next door the tree lights brighten the rodents' eyes</p> \n<p>And catches a glimpse of the dust beginning to rise</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p> </p> \n<p><iframe src=""https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify:user:1270767745:playlist:0HGwNuXSFr6CI2b2cOxOWv"" width=""300"" height=""380"" frameborder=""0"" allowtransparency=""true""></iframe></p>",Music
Why we treat Kim Jong Un like a clown instead of a brutal dictator,http://www.vox.com/2015/1/6/7459509/interview-asian-stereotype,Hollywood and American media have worked hand in hand in producing one of the most annoying and harmful caricatures of Asian men.,"<p>One of the biggest questions facing <i>The Interview</i> was just how offensive its depiction of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un was going to be. The hack of Sony Pictures and ensuing mania surrounding the movie had many convinced that we were going to see something super offensive, that either belittled the plight of the North Korean people or turned geopolitics into an excuse for fart jokes.</p> \n<p>I was worried that we were going to be treated to another clownish Asian stereotype.</p> \n<p>Hollywood has had a long track record of producing mystifyingly offensive Asian and Asian-American caricatures, enabling these stereotypes to live on and on in society. One pervasive, harmful type that Hollywood has gone to over and over is portraying Asian men as clueless clowns. And it seemed all but certain that Kim, as portrayed by Korean-American actor Randall Park, would fall into the same clownish role we've seen over and over.</p> \n<p>Thankfully, that assumption was wrong. But there was good reason to fear it. Here's why — and how <i>The Interview</i> surmounted this stereotype.</p> \n<h3><span>The Asian goofball stereotype</span></h3> \n<center> \n<p><iframe width=""420"" height=""315"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/0d5eP0wWLQY"" frameborder=""0""></iframe></p> \n</center> \n<p>Ten years ago, a tiny Berkeley student named William Hung appeared on the third season of <i>American Idol</i>, then the biggest show on television. His English was splintered, his accent snarled the words of Ricky Martin's ""She Bangs,"" and it didn't seem as if he fully understood why the judges were laughing at him.</p> \n<p>Hung became a star, outshining many finalists from that year. (Just try naming one that isn't Jennifer Hudson or Fantasia Barrino.) His first of three albums sold 200,000 copies.</p> \n<p>The only problem was that Hung was treated as a joke. People laughed at him, at his accent, and at his cluelessness. Hung himself seemed aware of the joke he was perpetuating.</p> \n<p>""OK, so I'm not famous for the right reasons,"" he told <a href=""http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/william-hung-bangs-out-debut-20040309"" target=""_blank"">Rolling Stone in 2004</a>. ""I'm infamous, a joke.

You can see this stereotype as far back as Mickey Rooney's Mr. Yunioshi in <i>Breakfast at Tiffany's</i>, or in Long Duk Dong from <i>Sixteen Candles. </i>You can even see it in the way people look at real life Asian men.</p> \n<p>For instance, consider Korean pop star Psy. When Psy stormed into public consciousness in 2012 on the back of his hit song ""Gangnam Style"" and some horse-like dance moves, it was unclear if people actually understood his message of satirizing class and wealth in<a href=""http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2012/08/gangnam-style-dissected-the-subversive-message-within-south-koreas-music-video-sensation/261462/"" target=""_blank""> South Korean society</a> or if people just liked the chubby dancing Asian man.</p> \n<p><span>There are a many talented and ultra-successful K-Pop groups with great hits and massive followings. Any could have hit the American charts. Thus, it's telling that the only K-Pop act to make it in America so far has been Psy. </span></p> \n<p>""Psy doesn't even have to sing in English or be understood because it's not the social critique offered by the lyrics that matters to the audience, but the marriage of the funny music video, goofy dance, and a rather catchy tune, of which two of the elements are comical and, again, non-threatening,"" <span>the writer </span><a style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.65;"" target=""_blank"" href=""https://twitter.com/refresh_daemon"">Refresh Daemon</a> wrote<span> </span><a style=""font-size: 1.15em; line-height: 1.65; background-color: #ffffff;"" href=""http://www.racialicious.com/2012/09/20/psy-and-the-acceptable-asian-man/"" target=""_blank"">on Racialicious</a><span>.</span></p> \n<p>You could also look at the flamboyant, savvy, and wealthy Chinese recycling tycoon Chen Guangbiao, who was, not unlike Psy, in on the joke of his image.</p> \n<p>In January of 2014, Chen stated that he wanted to buy The New York Times, then flew to the US to drum up support and attention for this massive and transparent publicity stunt.

These stories tend to affirm the idea that everyone writing and reading them is smarter than North Korea's ridiculous propaganda machine. </span></p> \n<p>We often view Kim through a lens of cultural superiority. The result of all these odd, weird, attention-grabbing stories, is an image of a silly, harmless ruler backed by an even sillier propaganda machine. And that image too often overshadows the terrifying human rights abuses that go on in his country.</p> \n<p><i>The Interview</i> is a product of this cultural consciousness. It tries hard to convince you it's satirizing the media's odd fascination with North Korea, but it doesn't seem to fully aware of the <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/12/28/7455907/interview-review"" target=""_blank"">American self-importance</a> that feeds that beast. The running gag in the movie is that North Koreans are so clueless that they don't believe Kim has an anus, a gag that's given more attention than exploring the idea that perhaps North Koreans and Kim are more than products of their propaganda, but in fact products of a century of brutal and often violent history on the Korean peninsula.</p> \n<h3>What <i>The Interview</i> and Randall Park did right</h3> \n<p><i>The Interview</i> is not a great movie. But one of its few bright spots is that it attempts — albeit in a ham-fisted way — to not go for the cheap clownish stereotype of Kim and actually show a human being with agency. There are clownish aspects to him, like a fascination with Katy Perry, but Park's Kim is depicted as both someone who's very aware of his image and someone who's clearly a monster.</p> \n<p>Kim's portrayal is already miles more honest than that of his father in <i>Team America, </i>where the central joke was Kim Jong Il's accent (""<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEaKX9YYHiQ"">ronery</a>""). There are even moments in <i>The Interview </i>when you wish the film realized how sharp it could be and leaned into the idea of a savvy, murdering despot. The film could suggest how Kim plays into these clownish stereotypes to get away with horrible things. That it doesn't is one of its greatest failings.</p> \n<p>It says a lot about (the lack of) Asian American representation in pop culture that I'm actually hoping a movie decides to show a more fully realized version of Kim. But when it comes to seeing people who resemble something closer to how I look and act, griping at the offensiveness and lack of awareness in <i>The Interview</i> is part of something bigger.</p> \n<p>And Park himself is part of an upcoming opportunity to push back against shopworn stereotypes. In February, ABC's sitcom <i>Fresh Off the Boat</i> — the first Asian-American family sitcom since 1994's <i>All-American Girl</i> — will premiere, starring Park in one of the main roles. This show might be silly, yes, but both it and <i>The Interview</i><i> </i>represent attempts to push beyond the goofballs we've already seen and capture something closer to life.</p>",Music
The 15 best songs of 2014,http://www.vox.com/2014/12/30/7463577/songs-of-the-year,These aren't the top selling or chart-performing songs of the year. These are just the 15 best songs of 2014:,"<p>There were more great songs produced in 2014 than could possibly fit on this list. Songs about mixtapes, and lipstick, and dating and heartbreak. Songs that can last a lifetime, or disappear into what in retrospect feels like a long, miserable year.</p> \n<p>But these 15 songs are the ones that left an impression on me — that used, abused, or completely ignored 2014 trends to create a sound that was distinct as it was memorable. These are songs that felt different — in tone, rhythm, quality, and lyricism — from everything else created this year. Some of them made important comments on the world we live in, and some are just great, timeless songs.</p> \n<p>These aren't the top selling or chart-performing songs of the year. These are just the 15 best songs of 2014:</p> \n<h3>1. ""New Romantics"" by Taylor Swift</h3> \n<p>""We're all bored/ We're all so tired of everything,"" <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/8/19/6033483/taylor-swift-new-single-shake-it-off-video"" target=""_blank"">Swift </a>drowsily sings in the intro to ""New Romantics,"" before cranking the volume all the way up, giving way to a dancing, jumping, screaming chorus. It's the guarded anger of ""Blank Space,"" the sleepy anxiety of ""Out of the Woods,"" and the pop-anthemic '80s chorus she promised us, all mixed in one.</p> \n<p>""New Romantics"" isn't a single off of Swift's anthemic <em>1989</em>. In fact, many fans who bought the album on iTunes don't even have the song. You could only find it hidden as a bonus track on the Target edition. This song is an intentionally buried gem, and it shows just how strategic a musician and businesswoman Swift really is.</p> \n<p>""It's poker, he can't see it in my face/ But I'm about to play my Ace,"" Swift murmurs. The ace is ""New Romantics."" It's a stronger, braver, more polished Swift than we've ever seen before, and it bodes well for her future.</p> \n<h3>2.  ""Close Your Eyes (and Count to Fuck)"" by Run the Jewels</h3> \n<p>Run the Jewels' excellent second album, <em>Run the Jewels 2,</em> could not be more different from <em>1989</em>. Indeed, it might be a better album overall.  No one else in hip-hop created faster, smoother rhymes than Killer Mike and El-P, the two members of Run the Jewels. Unlike the other songs on the album that rely on a call-and-response lyrical structure,  ""Close Your Eyes (and Count to Fuck)"" gives both Killer Mike and El-P room to extend their raps into incendiary critiques of the government and society.</p> \n<p><iframe frameborder=""0"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/fY3AXolAhYw"" height=""480"" width=""853""></iframe></p> \n<h3>3.  ""2 On"" by Tinashe featuring Schoolboy Q</h3> \n<p>Tinashe's songs aren't backed by the electronic dance music that was so ubiquitous in 2014. As such, the throwback R&amp;B jams of ""2 On"" felt like a breath of fresh air on an overcrowded dance floor. ""Get faded, turn up with the big boys/ Live fast, die young that's my choice,"" Tinashe sings in her calm, buttery voice creating a song that could just as easily ramp up or wind down a great evening out.</p> \n<p><iframe frameborder=""0"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/-s7TCuCpB5c"" height=""480"" width=""853""></iframe></p> \n<h3>4. ""Sugah Daddy"" by D'Angelo</h3> \n<p><a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/12/15/7394841/dangelo-black-messiah"">D'Angelo</a> dropped his first album in 14 years after most top lists of 2014 had been published. That's a shame because <em>Black Messiah </em>is full of incredible music. The bass is heavy and thick, the drums ricochet, and D'Angelo's voice is more mature — scratchier, heavier, and tougher — than it was in the past. ""Sugah Daddy"" is the height of 2014 soul.</p> \n<p><iframe frameborder=""0"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/HPp6pTrNw44"" height=""480"" width=""640""></iframe></p> \n<h3>5. ""0 to 100/The Catch Up"" by Drake</h3> \n<p>This song made me love Drake. Not only does ""0 to 100/The Catch Up"" feature some of Drake's best rapping, but he proves in this song that—for now at least—he can do whatever he wants and it will work. Here, he combines what could feel like two completely disconnected songs into a total hit.</p> \n<p><iframe frameborder=""0"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/I2bBZvSPpOo"" height=""480"" width=""853""></iframe></p> \n<h3>6.   ""Digital Witness"" by St. Vincent</h3> \n<p>With stretched out guitars and a beat that meld together to provide a funky, drifting quality, ""Digital Witness"" amply proves why Annie Clark has always been loved for her eccentric sound and ethereal voice. ""Ooh. I want all of your mind,"" Clark swoons, as the song tackles both love and surveillance culture.</p> \n<p><iframe frameborder=""0"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/mVAxUMuhz98"" height=""480"" width=""853""></iframe></p> \n<h3>7. ""Get On Your Knees"" Nicki Minaj feat. Ariana Grande</h3> \n<p>Grande, America's beloved tiny-bodied, huge-voiced baby Mariah, gets down and dirty with the queen of rap on ""Get On Your Knees."" Somehow, it works.</p> \n<p><iframe frameborder=""0"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/-cKimW8I7V0"" height=""480"" width=""853""></iframe></p> \n<h3>8. ""Octahate"" by Ryn Weaver</h3> \n<p>I was completely unsurprised when Soundcloud told me this was my most-listened to song of 2014. On her debut EP, Ryn Weaver hit pop music gold with ""Octahate."" It's catchy. It's angry. It's great. Written by pop goddess Charli XCX, Weaver created the perfect blend of indie-electronica and mainstream pop.</p> \n<p><iframe frameborder=""0"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/hTVZdW8pTEM"" height=""480"" width=""853""></iframe></p> \n<h3>9. ""Boom Clap"" by Charli XCX</h3> \n<p>""Boom Clap"" was a potential candidate for 2014's Song of the Summer, thanks to its pulsing beats and seemingly effortless lyricism. With her two number-one hits this year, Charli XCX is quickly becoming one of the best pop songwriters in the game (see, literally, one above), and ""Boom Clap"" was the best song she performed this year.</p> \n<p><iframe frameborder=""0"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/AOPMlIIg_38"" height=""480"" width=""853""></iframe></p> \n<h3>10. ""Unfucktheworld"" by Angel Olsen</h3> \n<p>""I wanted nothing but for this to be the end/ for this to never be a tight and empty hands,"" Angel Olsen croons on ""Unfucktheworld."" At just two minutes long, it's one of the shortest songs on her album, and it sets the stage for the dreamy, dreary, lonely collection that was perfect for an often difficult year.</p> \n<p><iframe frameborder=""0"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/iNfnoLD_tAY"" height=""480"" width=""853""></iframe></p> \n<h3>11. ""i"" by Kendrick Lamar</h3> \n<p>""i"" was the only song Lamar released in 2014, and it's a self-affirming, dance-friendly jam. Yet ""i"" also features an Ernie Isley guitar solo and a political undercurrent, making it a deeper song than its groovy backing-beats.</p> \n<p><iframe frameborder=""0"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/8aShfolR6w8"" height=""480"" width=""853""></iframe></p> \n<h3>12. ""Your Love is Killing Me"" by Sharon Van Etten</h3> \n<p>Sharon Van Etten creates a mammoth masterpiece in ""Your Love is Killing Me."" At six-and-a-half minutes long, the song is twice the length of most others on the list, but it never feels monotonous or clumsy. Instead, the creepy torch song becomes more and more captivating with each listen.</p> \n<p><iframe frameborder=""0"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/nyuPWHwZru0"" height=""480"" width=""853""></iframe></p> \n<h3>13. ""Move that Dope"" by Future, Pharrell Williams, Pusha T, and Casino</h3> \n<p>Future hadn't produced a relevant, ground-breaking song in arguably three years, and he was quickly falling into disappointing obscurity. ""Move that Dope"" brought him back. With a stacked featured artist cast, and a convoluted adaption of Salt-N-Pepa's ""Push it,"" Future finally pushes it real good again.</p> \n<p><iframe frameborder=""0"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/wHguy4xHGSg"" height=""480"" width=""853""></iframe></p> \n<h3>14. ""Say You Love Me"" by Jessie Ware</h3> \n<p>Jessie Ware has better vocals than almost any female pop artist out there right now, and she's creating music that hovers perfectly between positivity and angst. ""Say You Love Me"" is a heart-wrenching, desperate song as warm as Ware's whispering vocals.</p> \n<p><iframe frameborder=""0"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/DAMM8JVbr8g"" height=""480"" width=""853""></iframe></p> \n<h3>15.

""Two Weeks"" is the closest Twigs comes to traditional pop music on the album, using a traditional verse-chorus-verse format, buoyed by the fact that the chorus is hella catchy.</p> \n<p><iframe frameborder=""0"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/3yDP9MKVhZc"" height=""480"" width=""853""></iframe></p> \n<p><span>Here's a playlist of every one of the 102 songs I almost picked as Best Song of 2014.

Empire shows that commanding the dying music industry is an impossible task,http://www.vox.com/2015/1/8/7513499/empire-review-fox,Empire is a show about the record industry in a time when no one actually knows what the record industry is,"<p>Fox's new prime time soap <em>Empire, </em>which debuted last night, opens with a frustrated recording artist singing the same riff over and over, until a bigwig executive decides her sound is as close to full devastation as it can get. The studio where she sings has walls made of wood and a soundboard with a thousand buttons and levers; on the second level of the studio, a man sleeps on a full-sized leather couch, while his colleagues bicker over the perfection of the last note.</p> \n<p>The studio, the executives, and even the sound are nostalgic, calling back to a version of the record industry that exuded money, talent, and confidence. But that's also a record industry that no longer exists. Fortunately, the show quickly proves it realizes that.</p> \n<p><em>Empire </em>is a show about the record industry in a time when no one actually knows what the record industry is, much less what it will look like in 10 years. That's what makes it such an interesting show, particularly for music fans. <em>Empire </em>dares to deal with a question that no one can answer.</p> \n<h3>The music industry is just that: an industry</h3> \n<p>Music, we like to think, is art. Its creators believe it to be art, and its fans find it sublime.</p> \n<p>""Show me your soul in this music,"" Lucious Lyon (Terrence Howard), the aforementioned bigwig, commands the singer in the opening scene. The people around him think the vocalist already sounds great. But Lucious isn't satisfied. He evokes her brother's death, and forces her to a level of passion and range she hadn't exhibited before. That's art.</p> \n<p>But everything beyond the creation of art is the business of music. Sex, drugs, and rock-and-roll may make for fun storytelling, but they aren't what weaves together a billion-dollar industry. By attempting to tackle the business behind the art, <em>Empire</em> goes somewhere similar shows like <em>Nashville </em>and <em>Power </em>never dared touch. For many shows, the music business is far too messy and complicated to bother with.</p> \n<p>Yes, the industry is ridiculously complicated. Every song has multiple authors and six copyrights, and the Department of Justice is involved in who gets paid how much for which format. To create a show like <em>Empire</em> and center it on the industry is to risk having the premise for your story outdated before the show even airs. Fortunately, the show has an ace in the hole. Much of its storyline is rooted in the family dynamics of Lucious.</p> \n<h3>Music is a personal business</h3> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""2915624"" alt=""empire 2"" src=""https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2915624/tv_empire2a.0.jpg""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Two brothers drink champagne on the porch of a boat (Fox)</p> \n<p>Lucious, patriarch of <em>Empire</em> and head of the Empire Enterprises label, is dying. His massive music label needs a new person to run it, and Lyon believes that he can find that leader among his three sons: Andre, Jamal, and Hakeem.</p> \n<p>All art is based on interpretation, and the show is just as much about Lucious's judgments of his sons as it is about the future of the business. Andre, the oldest and the obvious choice, has shadowed his father, gone to grad school, and worked to take over the company. But Lucious worries that he doesn't have the artistry; that he isn't as talented as he needs to be. The youngest, Hakeem, has the opposite problem. Hakeem is probably the most talented musician of the bunch and sounds like a young Kendrick Lamar when he freestyles in the pilot, but he's fickle and has an alcohol problem.</p> \n<p>Jamal is the happy medium, a talented songwriter who understands artistry but also has good business sense. His life seems more stable than his brother's, but he's gay, which for Lucious is a hurdle he can't quite clear. Lucious is uneasy around Jamal and doesn't have the understanding and love for him that his mother, Cookie, so clearly exhibits. Jamal would be the perfect candidate if music and life weren't so tightly woven together.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""center"">The industry his sons belong to is massively different from the one Lucious came up in</q></p> \n<p>Lucious doesn't make his choice in the pilot. After all, there wouldn't be a show if he did. But there's another, deeper reason for why he hesitates on this deeply personal choice. The industry his sons belong to is massively different from the one Lucious came up in.</p> \n<p>Early in the pilot, Lucious announces to his board of directors that he's taking the company public. But first, he tells a personal anecdote:  ""I started selling drugs when I was 9 years old in Philadelphia. I did it to feed myself. But it was music that kept me alive when I thought I was gonna get shot."" It's a story not unlike Jay-Z Carter's rise to fame in Brooklyn. In fact, Empire Enterprises makes a solid fictional stand-in for Jay-Z's very successful label Roc Nation. Its only problem is that Lucious is stuck in a past that just doesn't exist anymore.</p> \n<p>Lucious was nationally famous, beloved by many, and known by all. His sons, however, live in a world one where no one buys albums, streaming is the future, and the monoculture is long gone.</p> \n<h3>Music is not a dying business</h3> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""2915626"" alt=""empire 3"" src=""https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2915626/empire_pilot_howard_henson.0.jpg""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Lucious and Cookie in the board room (Fox)</p> \n<p><span>Yet despite the perennial doomsday chatter around the music industry, the Lyon family battles over who will get to run the company, and not just for sentimental family reasons. Even though  Lyon is clear that the company needs money and the industry is in trouble, his sons (and his ex-wife) clamor to run the company. There's money in music somewhere, and everyone knows it. They just have to find it.</span></p> \n<p>How people make money off music is no longer clear. As Lucious notes, ""The internet has destroyed the musicians ability to make money."" There are no more records to print and ship around the company and sell at a huge markup. There are no CD cases. There aren't even any true iPods left to buy. Instead, the music industry is trying to calculate just how much it can charge artists so musicians and songwriters can be fairly compensated, without charging so much that listeners give up and simply pirate what they want to hear.</p> \n<p>On top of all of the family drama, label mishaps, and allusions to Lyon's criminal past, <em>Empire</em> hangs its hat on one of the most popular arguments against streaming: ""It's impossible for disenfranchised kids,"" Lyons says to the board about making money in the music in 2015. And that is where the show fails dramatically.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""center"">Lucious's view of what it takes to become a hip-hop artist is hopelessly out of touch</q></p> \n<p>It's not impossible for disenfranchised kids to make music. In fact, its easier than ever. Any kid can become a YouTube star, theoretically. Though that won't likely lead to becoming a leather-couch-owning, golden-record-touting record titan, it isn't necessarily a bad thing. Lucious's view of what it takes to become a hip-hop artist is hopelessly out of touch, ignoring the Yung Leans and Kendrick Lamars of the world. But there's also so much inherent drama in the balance between making money from art in a time when no one's quite sure how to do that.</p> \n<p>Despite tackling all of these issues, <em>Empire </em>is fun, soapy, and ridiculous in the way only primetime television can be. But if we're being honest, the music industry is just as soapy and ridiculous. In music, the business and the personal endlessly mix together. In that regard, <em>Empire </em>is absolutely successful.</p>",Music
Kelly Clarkson's new single sounds freakishly like Jimmy Eat World's biggest hit,http://www.vox.com/2015/1/12/7532603/kelly-clarkson-heartbeat-song,This is a little too close to seem like a coincidence,"<p>Kelly Clarkson dropped the first single from her upcoming seventh studio album this morning.

Something about the chorus sounded familiar.</p> \n<p>Listen to the song here:</p> \n<p><iframe frameborder=""0"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/XxVX_To0Ntg"" height=""480"" width=""853""></iframe></p> \n<p>At first, I thought the similarity was reminding me of Jessie J's ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMxX-QOV9tI"" target=""_blank"">Price Tag</a>,"" but the cadence of the chorus's ""This is my heartbeat song/ and I'm gonna play it/ been so long I forgot how to turn it up up up up all night long,"" sounded like something even older to me.</p> \n<p>It sounded like Jimmy Eat World:</p> \n<p><iframe width=""853"" height=""480"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/oKsxPW6i3pM"" frameborder=""0""></iframe></p> \n<p> </p> \n<p>The similarities become even more stark when you play the two songs at the same time:</p> \n<table border=""0"" cellspacing=""0"" cellpadding=""0""> \n<tbody> \n<tr> \n<td valign=""top"" height=""355"" width=""425"">\n<object width=""425"" height=""355""><param name=""movie"" value=""http://www.youtube.com/v/oKsxPW6i3pM&amp;start=14&amp;autoplay=0""> <param name=""wmode"" value=""transparent""> <embed src=""http://www.youtube.com/v/oKsxPW6i3pM&amp;start=14&amp;autoplay=0"" mce_src=""http://www.youtube.com/v/oKsxPW6i3pM&amp;start=14&amp;autoplay=0"" type=""application/x-shockwave-flash"" wmode=""transparent"" width=""425"" height=""355""></embed></object> </td> \n<td valign=""top"" height=""355"" width=""425"">\n<object width=""425"" height=""355""><param name=""movie"" value=""http://www.youtube.com/v/Z2K6uxIFO6w&amp;start=15&amp;autoplay=0""> <param name=""wmode"" value=""transparent""> <embed src=""http://www.youtube.com/v/Z2K6uxIFO6w&amp;start=15&amp;autoplay=0"" mce_src=""http://www.youtube.com/v/Z2K6uxIFO6w&amp;start=15&amp;autoplay=0"" type=""application/x-shockwave-flash"" wmode=""transparent"" width=""425"" height=""355""></embed></object> </td> \n</tr> \n<tr> \n<td colspane=""2""><span><a href=""http://youtubedoubler.com/?video1=oKsxPW6i3pM&amp;start1=14&amp;video2=Z2K6uxIFO6w&amp;start2=15&amp;authorName=snoopsagan"">YouTube Doubler</a></span></td> \n</tr> \n</tbody> \n</table> \n<p> </p> \n<p>Now, to be fair, most pop songs build off the many, many pop songs that have come before. But this is a little too close to seem like a coincidence, and because of the call-back effect, Clarkson's new song sounds 15 years old. That's likely not what the pop singer was trying for.</p>",Music
How Sleater-Kinney became one of the last great rock bands,http://www.vox.com/2015/1/20/7855283/sleater-kinney,"10 years after their last album, Sleater-Kinney is back.","<p>The opening guitar line on ""Price Tag"" only peeks through Corin Tucker's raw vocal performance. But that guitar line does more than introduce the first song on Sleater-Kinney's first new album in 10 years; it also announces a rebirth.</p> \n<p>""Price Tag"" is a pounding anthem about greed, broken humanity, and giving power to the powerless. As Tucker says in the liner notes as printed by <a href=""https://www.subpop.com/releases/sleater_kinney/no_cities_to_love"">Subpop</a>, the song is about the ""struggle to be heard against the dominant culture or status quo."" That, in a nutshell, is the battle this three-piece band has been fighting since their 1995 self-titled debut album<em>. </em></p> \n<p>Sleater-Kinney is one of the most important bands out there — but if you're like a lot of people, you've probably never heard of it.</p> \n<p>Here's everything you need to know before you listen to the trio's eighth LP, <em>No Cities to Love</em>, out Tuesday, January 20.</p> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3319814/56904118.0.jpg"" alt=""sleater"" data-chorus-asset-id=""3319814""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Corin Tucker, Carrie Brownstein, and Janet Weiss at Arthurfest in 2005 ( Bob Berg/Getty)</p> \n<h3>What is Sleater-Kinney?</h3> \n<p>Sleater-Kinney is a left-leaning, feminism-preaching rock band that emerged out of the Pacific Northwest's indie-rock scene in the mid-90s. The group is made up of Corin Tucker on lead vocals and guitar, Carrie Brownstein also on guitar and vocals, and Janet Weiss on drums.</p> \n<p>The group took its name from a <a href=""http://www.pqarchiver.com/titles?dids=323815131:323815131&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Apr+11%252C+2003&amp;author=CURTIS+ROSS&amp;pub=Tampa+Tribune&amp;desc=Sleater-Kinney+Backs+Message+With+Meaningful+Rock&amp;pqatl=google"">highway exit</a> in Lacey, Washington, near where the band formed in 1994. Tucker and Brownstein formed the band as a side-project from other groups, but eventually, Sleater-Kinney became their primary focus. Tucker and Brownstein have been with the band in every iteration. The drummer position has been held by three other women, but Janet Weiss is the most recent and longest lasting drummer for the group.</p> \n<p>The group released seven LPs between 1995 and 2005 and even opened for Pearl Jam. With every album, its sound became a little cleaner and a little less angry. Then, in 2006, the band announced a hiatus without explanation.</p> \n<p>The next 10 years went by without another Sleater-Kinney album. Weiss joined another band, Tucker released two solo albums titled <em>1,000 Years </em> and <em>Kill My Blues</em>, and Brownstein started a band named Wild Flag and co-created <em>Portlandia</em>, the Emmy-nominated sketch comedy show on IFC<em>.</em></p> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3319820/105047078.0.jpg"" alt=""Carrie Sleater"" data-chorus-asset-id=""3319820""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Carrie Brownstein of Sleater-Kinney during The Village Voice 2nd Annual 'Siren Music Festival'  ( Theo Wargo/Getty)</p> \n<h3>Why is the band featuring only women such a big deal?</h3> \n<p>""It almost seems like there's this backlash against any kind of forward thinking,"" Tucker told <a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20110913170711/http://searchmagnified.com//?dn=imgis.com&amp;fp=raY7poQwl6%2FC%2BnBaHXWUBb7Z8Pjclq%2F23OmO7AlbMX1Wm8vJz5ClZrueTw6k%2BRYpR9E2TJnqdRzHk6iZxKeXdg%3D%3D&amp;prvtof=xXU%2BqT140Bawbtck1dyXX8NjI9zmYhtGOgxnQSeuRjw%3D&amp;poru=ntlybCgU1SgnZUWlwUswG5TIjmqIOIIQS0b4gSxeJAqwqxfVzrMtPKHTJlIe8bmmi5Mgse4hZiQSsFFAxJgXTBSzzt7YWsDlriwyzKlhM%2Bs%3D&amp;cifr=1&amp;"">Dr. Drew magazine</a> in 2000, ""Looking at the sexism in rock, people are doing it so deliberately, and men are grasping for any power they can in a really ugly way.""</p> \n<p>Even though there have been female voices in popular music since its inception, women are often relegated to genres that are often looked down on by music critics and the community as a whole. Think of pop, for instance. Until very recently, the genre was seen as a place for sell-outs, lackluster talents — and women.</p> \n<p>The counter to pop was rock — a big-haired, big-guitared boys' club. Into that world strode Sleater-Kinney, a band of all women dominating its own section of the indie-rock scene, decidedly <em>not</em> there to be a ""girl band."" To Sleater-Kinney, boys just didn't matter. The band was great, and it didn't give a fuck what the boys were doing.</p> \n<p>""I won’t suck your big ego and then swallow all my pride / I’m just spitting out the memory and stains you left inside of me,"" Tucker sings on ""How to Play Dead"" from the band's self-titled debut. Beginning with a kiss-off to the male dominated industry turned out to be indicative of the group's approach.</p> \n<p>Take a song like ""I Wanna Be Your Joey Ramone,"" from the band's 1996 LP <em>Call the Doctor</em>. Sleater-Kinney wanted to take over.</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>""I wanna be your Joey Ramone</p> \n<p>Pictures of me on your bedroom door</p> \n<p>Invite you back after the show</p> \n<p>I'm the queen of Rock and roll.""</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Tucker's voice chimes over Brownstein's walking guitar line until Tucker finally screams over the pounding drums. This is rock and roll, and Sleater-Kinney isn't asking anybody if it can play in this sandbox. It's telling everybody the next great band has arrived.</p> \n<h3>What are the five Sleater-Kinney songs I need to hear to understand the group's appeal?</h3> \n<p><strong>1) ""How to Play Dead"" from 1995's <em>Sleater-Kinney</em></strong></p> \n<p><iframe width=""640"" height=""480"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/J-JAett6nSc"" frameborder=""0""></iframe></p> \n<p>""How to Play Dead"" is an angry rant against a guy who can't enjoy his blow job because he's too high. It evolves into a feminist breaking point whose vital lyrics you can see above.</p> \n<p><strong>2) ""One More Hour"" from 1997's <em>Dig Me Out</em></strong></p> \n<p><iframe width=""640"" height=""480"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/3VoWc3yypHs"" frameborder=""0""></iframe></p> \n<p>This is the breakup song of all breakup songs. In fact, Tucker and Brownstein recorded it in the midst of their breakup. It shows an emotional core of sadness and hardship that would create many of the group's most famous songs in the future.</p> \n<p><strong>3) ""#1 Must Have"" from 2000's <em>All Hands on the Bad One</em></strong></p> \n<p><iframe width=""640"" height=""480"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/uIP0iIxHLY4"" frameborder=""0""></iframe></p> \n<p>""#1 Must Have"" features a catchy melody, a sharp guitar line, and a deep, deep anger. The song alludes to the deep misogyny of the music industry and specifically refers to the <a href=""http://web.archive.org/web/20011121093035/http://www.addict.com/issues/6.05/html/hifi/Cover_Story/Sleater-Kinney/index02.html"">1999 Woodstock</a> at which several women were raped.</p> \n<p><strong>4) ""Jumpers"" from 2005's <em>The Woods</em></strong></p> \n<p><iframe width=""853"" height=""480"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/vZA_7FtttRY"" frameborder=""0""></iframe></p> \n<p>The first six albums of Sleater-Kinney's career were thrashing attacks on misogyny. <em>The Woods</em> took a step back into a calmer, more polished arena. On ""Jumpers,"" a great guitar riff rings out, and sadness saturates this song about Golden Gate Bridge jumpers.</p> \n<p><strong>5) ""Bury Our Friends"" from 2015's <em>No Cities to Love</em></strong></p> \n<p><iframe width=""853"" height=""480"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/tRNDB9VqI3Q"" frameborder=""0""></iframe></p> \n<p>""We're wild and weary, but we won't give in,"" Sleater-Kinney sings in the chorus of this  new song. If the band has proved anything with this album, it's that the group isn't giving in anytime soon. With those discordant vocals and guitar riffs, Sleater-Kinney is still wild, but it doesn't sound weary.</p> \n<h3>Why did the band decide to break up? Why did it come back?</h3> \n<p><em>No Cities to Love</em> is Sleater-Kinney's first album since <em>The Woods</em>.</p> \n<p>""It was the end of a chapter, but there was a sense of accomplishment to have not skidded to a halt — we beat [Gwyneth] Paltrow on <a href=""http://goop.com/conscious-uncoupling-2/"">‘conscious uncoupling’</a> by about 10 years,"" Brownstein told Jessica Hopper at <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/articles/9576-sleater-kinney-a-certain-rebellion/"">Pitchfork</a>.</p> \n<p><em>No Cities to Love</em>, then,<em> </em>is a remarriage. It's a renewal of vows to be badass. To be difficult. To be great.</p> \n<p>Weiss told Pitchfork that the band rejoined because, ""We had no reason not to."" They were all still friends, they all still loved Sleater-Kinney, and they all wanted to create another album — if they could create something that sounded new.</p> \n<p>""It should sound urgent and as necessary as if we had just started as a band. And I think the only hesitation was whether we’d be able to achieve that, and so that’s what gave us pause,"" Brownstein told <a href=""http://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2015/01/carrie-brownstein-fill-in-the-blank.html"">Paste Magazine</a>. ""That’s why we didn’t announce anything. We kind of waited to see if we were capable of that.""</p> \n<p>But the world of music has changed in the 10 years Sleater-Kinney has been away. The indie band that can support itself financially — a small band with a healthy following that will turn out to watch the band perform and buy its albums — increasingly doesn't exist in 2015 the way that it did in 1995 or even 2005.</p> \n<p>Yet fans of the band will likely be more than willing to pick up with the group right where it left off. When Sleater-Kinney dropped out of music, there was no band to fill the angry, punk-tinted, rock-shaped hole it left. It was a trailblazer no one followed, and, thus, it didn't leave a path of influenced artists behind them to take their place. The return of Sleater-Kinney, then, is an opportunity to fill that gap again, and to hopefully influence groups of the future — especially in a world where rock music seems increasingly irrelevant.</p> \n<p>There are plenty of artists out there that won't ever be Taylor Swifts or One Directions, but might just be Nirvanas or Pavements or even Sleater-Kinneys. Having the trio back makes that all the more likely.</p> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3319822/110278015.0.jpg"" alt=""sleater"" data-chorus-asset-id=""3319822""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Carrie Brownstein at the 2006 Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festiva ( Barry Brecheisen/Getty)</p> \n<h3>Is <em>No Cities to Love </em>worth the long, long wait?</h3> \n<p>Despite how good those first seven albums are and how defining they were to the band's sound, <em>No Cities to Love</em> is my favorite Sleater-Kinney album yet.</p> \n<p>The girls these women were in their 20s are still there, still riddled with anger and frustration and fear. But these musicians are smarter now — not necessarily subdued, but more calculated. As a result, the intensity of <em>No Cities to Love</em> feels stronger than ever before, even if the guitar riffs are a shorter and the drums reined in. It's that care, that precision and calculation, that guides Sleater-Kinney now.</p> \n<p><span>Tucker and Brownstein dated until 1997. On the first three Sleater-Kinney albums, their voices intertwined perfectly, one peaking while the other fell, or dropping back to make room for the other. By 1997's breakup album </span><em style=""font-size: 1.15em; line-height: 1.65;"">Dig Me Out</em><span>, they had fallen into comfortable but separate spaces, with Brownstein backing up Tucker in the rhythm section while Tucker made the melody or the screaming chorus.</span></p> \n<p>In <em>No Cities to Love</em> the pair's relationship has matured. They don't drown each other out, or muddy each other's voices. On ""Bury Our Friends,"" the album's first single, Tucker begins the song with a verse that alternates between talking and singing, climbing to the peaks of her alto range before Brownstein joins in to sing the chorus. Their voices meld together but never quite sync up perfectly, as they both hit the notes they were individually meant to find. It's a great reminder of how Sleater-Kinney has worked for so long because it allows for <em>all</em> of its voices to shine through, not just one.</p> \n<p><em>No Cities to Love</em> channels so much of what makes Sleater-Kinney a great rock band. It's emotional, angry, and smart. The lyrics are wrenching and relentless. It has the balletic riffs of 1999's <em>The Hot Rock</em>, the anger and passion of <em>Sleater-Kinney,</em> and the anthemic choruses of <em>The Woods</em>.</p> \n<p>On the final track of the album ""Fade"" Tucker and Brownstein sing, ""All of the roles that we play/ In your mark, close the worlds, let's escape."" What's perfect about <em>No Cities to Love</em> is that the only role Sleater-Kinney has to play anymore is its own.</p> \n<h3>Where can I hear the album?</h3> \n<p><em>No Cities to Love</em> is available for purchase on iTunes and streaming on Spotify. It is also available on vinyl.</p> \n<p>You can listen to the whole album here:</p> \n<p><iframe allowtransparency=""true"" frameborder=""0"" height=""380"" width=""300"" src=""https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify:album:1l7gMbzE7RRAdYddJSfM5B""></iframe></p>",Music
The 11 best songs of January,http://www.vox.com/2015/1/31/7954105/best-songs-January,2015 is going to be a great year for music.,"<p>If January is any indication, then 2015 is going to be a <em>great</em> year for music. This month was filled with terrific songs, from artists who are new on the map, like Natalie Prass, and familiar faces, like Sleater-Kinney.</p> \n<p>Here are the 11 best songs from the first month of 2015:</p> \n<h3>Torres, ""Strange Hellos""</h3> \n<p><iframe src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/187188055&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false"" frameborder=""no"" scrolling=""no"" height=""166"" width=""100%""></iframe></p> \n<p>At South by Southwest in 2013, Mackenzie Scott (who performs as Torres) looked like just another singer-songwriter, one of dozens of women singing indie-folk about heartbreak and loneliness. But when she opened her mouth, that all fell away. Torres's self-titled debut album continued that trend, featuring anthemic rock and punk vocals filled with passion and anger. On ""Strange Hellos,"" the first single from her sophomore album, that anger hasn't subdued, but it has become controlled.  ""I was all for being real/but if I don't believe then no one will,"" Scott growls. It's the perfect kickoff to what promises to be a hell of a 2015 for her.</p> \n<h3>Tobias Jesso Jr ""How Could You Babe""</h3> \n<p><iframe frameborder=""0"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/uu1Ko02P7vk"" height=""480"" width=""853""></iframe></p> \n<p>The singles that have been released off of Jesso's upcoming album <em>Goon</em> have aimed to capture the heart and soul of the city: the loneliness, the hustle, the desperation. The latest single, ""How Could You Babe,"" is the closest Jesso has come to writing a song that could be the backing track to both a good, long crying jag and a lonely stroll through Central Park. The beauty of this song is in Jesso's voice hovering over his piano playing, sliding into higher vocal registers to sing, ""How could you babe,"" over and over and over again. Heartbreaking.</p> \n<h3>Natalie Prass ""My Baby Don't Understand Me""</h3> \n<p><iframe src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/172419999&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false"" frameborder=""no"" scrolling=""no"" height=""166"" width=""100%""></iframe></p> \n<p>Natalie Prass finished recording her debut self-titled album in 2012, expecting to release it in 2013. Because she is signed to a tiny, tiny label, the finished project didn't roll out until this week. Fortunately, it was worth the wait. ""I don't feel much...,"" Prass coos on ""My Baby Don't Understand Me,"" but her trembling voice makes it clear that she feels everything. Deeply. Prassi's incredible vocals gain altitude thanks to her backing band, which keeps building this song into something pristine and powerful.</p> \n<h3>Waxahatchee ""Air""</h3> \n<p><iframe src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/185103374&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false"" frameborder=""no"" scrolling=""no"" height=""166"" width=""100%""></iframe></p> \n<p>Katie Crutchfield, the singer-songwriter behind Waxahatchee, turned raw feelings into chords on her first two albums. But here, on ""Air,"" she takes the intimacy of those albums and turns it into a passion that radiates. ""Air"" contains quirky lyrics like ""I left you out like a carton of milk/ You were quick to query me/ but I wanted you still."" But its steady drumbeat and chord progressions turn it into something more anthemic. The song is the first single off the forthcoming <em>Ivy Tripp</em>.</p> \n<h3>Misterwives ""Our Own House""</h3> \n<p><iframe frameborder=""0"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/8wtj2snRuUI"" height=""480"" width=""853""></iframe></p> \n<p>""Came in like the breeze/ I felt it in my knees,"" lead vocalist Mandy Lee Duffy sings in the opening sequence of Misterwives' ""Our Own House."" Her wispy vocals mirror the lyrics. The indie-pop group released its debut EP <em>Reflections</em> last year, and it rose quickly in critical acclaim and popularity. Misterwives is a rarity in the 2015 music scene: a true pop band. On ""Our Own House,"" they add horns to their usual lineup, creating a song that gains so much energy as it goes that by the end, the whispering intro seems like another planet.</p> \n<h3>Sleater-Kinney ""No Cities to Love""</h3> \n<p><iframe frameborder=""0"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/Cj2k3QsHmyM"" height=""480"" width=""853""></iframe></p> \n<p><a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/1/20/7855283/sleater-kinney"">Sleater-Kinney </a>released its first album in 10 years this year. The intensity of ""No Cities to Love"" feels stronger than ever before, even if the guitar riffs are shorter and the drums more reined in. That care, that precision and calculation, guides Sleater-Kinney now. On the second single from the album, everything that makes Sleater-Kinney a great rock band shines: the vocals are emotional and powerful, and the instrumentation is clean and fast. ""No Cities to Love"" is a reminder not just of how great <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/1/20/7855283/sleater-kinney"">Sleater-Kinney</a> used to be, but of how great they are today.</p> \n<h3>Will Butler ""Anna""</h3> \n<p><iframe frameborder=""0"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/0xZxpd23iuU"" height=""480"" width=""853""></iframe></p> \n<p>Arcade Fire's Will Butler will release his first solo album, <em>Policy,</em> in March. ""Anna,"" the first single, mixes '80s synthesizers, spoken word choruses, and a funk baseline. Part of the goal of this record is to make people excited enough to pay attention when I'm 80,"" Butler told <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/update/9586-will-butler/"">Pitchfork</a> in January, comparing <em>Policy</em> to Neil Young's debut album. ""Anna"" isn't <em>that</em> iconic, but it's certainly catchy, and it has the energy of a new voice, even though Butler has been producing music for over a decade.</p> \n<h3>Frank Ocean ""(At Your Best) You are Love""</h3> \n<p>""(At Your Best) You Are Love"" was released by The Isley Brothers in 1976, but that's not who Frank Ocean honors in his cover of the song. Instead, his version clings tightly to Aaliyah's 1994 rendition, which appeared on her debut album. Built atop only Ocean's voice and a gentle piano behind him, ""(At Your Best) You are Love"" becomes a vulnerable, heartbreaking song that recalls much of the political unrest of the last few months, all without once mentioning it.</p> \n<p><a href=""http://frankocean.tumblr.com/post/108321281171"">Listen at Tumblr</a></p> \n<h3>Marina and the Diamonds, ""Immortal""</h3> \n<p><iframe frameborder=""0"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/dYGKxxTXqSs"" height=""480"" width=""853""></iframe></p> \n<p>Welsh singer-songwriter Marina and the Diamonds released ""Immortal,"" a single from upcoming third album <em>Froot </em>in January. It's a moody, sad-girl song with an electro pop background. ""If I could buy forever at a price/I would buy it twice, twice,"" Marina sings on the track, a heavy reminder about the undying, immortal power of love. With her style, crooning lyrics, and the retro feel of the music video's visuals, Marina will likely appeal to fans of Lana Del Rey's 2014 album <em>Ultraviolence</em>.</p> \n<h3>Tove Styrke, ""Ego""</h3> \n<p><iframe src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/187332137&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false"" frameborder=""no"" scrolling=""no"" height=""166"" width=""100%""></iframe></p> \n<p>One part pop and one part weird electronic textures, ""Ego"" is a song about lost love where the Swedish Styrke sings (in an upbeat tone, no less), ""I wanna hold you/ but you're untouchable/ too cool/ caught up in your ego."" The rolling drums in the background and the catchy chorus make it easy to imagine this being a radio hit along the lines of Tove Lo's ""<a href=""http://open.spotify.com/track/4dL1HwRWQgWK9timX9PLex"">Habits (Stay High</a>).""</p> \n<h3>Charli XCX featuring Rita Ora ""Doing it""</h3> \n<p><iframe frameborder=""0"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/Km3agvlyRmM"" height=""480"" width=""853""></iframe></p> \n<p><a style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.65;"" href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/10/10/6949039/charli-xcx-brunette-fancy"" target=""_blank"">Charli XCX</a> released her sophomore album, <em>Sucker,</em> in late 2014. A fast, upbeat album with all of the features of a chart-climbing masterpiece, <em>Sucker</em> is catchy, fun, and surprisingly laid-back. This remix, featuring Rita Ora, could be Charli XCX's attempt to strike gold twice. Charli sang the riff on Iggy Azalea's ""Fancy,"" which came out in March of 2014 and went on to become the song of the summer. ""Doing It"" has the same fun-in-the-sun vibes, but it's also perfect for a late winter house party.</p> \n<p>The songs on this list that are available on Spotify can be listened to here:</p> \n<p><iframe allowtransparency=""true"" frameborder=""0"" height=""380"" width=""300"" src=""https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify:user:1270767745:playlist:0wa11g5LgqJo8Md0P4sV4E""></iframe></p>",Music
"Here's why Song, Album, and Record of the year are different Grammys",http://www.vox.com/2015/2/6/7988827/heres-why-song-album-and-record-of-the-year-are-different-grammys,Everything you need to know to keep these categories straight,"<p>There are just four Grammy Awards where artists from all musical genres compete against each other — Album of the Year, Record of the Year, Song of the Year, and New Artist. Country artists bump up against R&amp;B musicians, and they're both taking on pop stars. If an artist wins one of these awards, they'll make headlines and get to give a nice, long speech at the awards telecast.</p> \n<p>But the categories at the Grammys are already steeped in confusing industry speak, and the top four awards are no different. With the exception of New Artist, it's easy to confuse the other three.</p> \n<p>Here's everything you need to know to keep these categories straight:</p> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3379072/arcade_fire_grammy.0.jpg"" alt=""arcade fire grammy"" data-chorus-asset-id=""3379072""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Arcade Fire celebrates their Album of the Year (Kevork Djansezian/Getty)</p> \n<h3>Album of the Year</h3> \n<p>The Album of the Year award is the most prestigious Grammy there is, the rough equivalent of the Best Picture Oscar. The category honors an entire LP, from first track to last, and everything about the production of the album's sound.</p> \n<p>Originally, the Album of the Year award went only to the artist credited with the creation of the album and the album's producers.</p> \n<p>But starting in 1999, with Lauryn Hill's win for <em>The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill</em>, the sound engineers and mixers of the album have also been rewarded, as have featured artists. If you participated in the creation of the sound of the album, you get a gramophone. However, the album's songwriters are not included in this award.</p> \n<p><strong>How to remember it: </strong> The whole album gets an award! Some people confuse this award with ""Record of the Year,"" since albums used to be on records and, thus, the two terms became synonymous in common parlance. But singles also came on records, and you wouldn't call a single song ""Album of the Year.""</p> \n<p><strong>Fun fact: </strong>Paul McCartney has the most nominations of any performer in this category with nine: five for his work with The Beatles, three for solo albums, and one for his work with Wings.</p> \n<p><strong>The nominees this year are: </strong>Beck for <em>Morning Phase, </em>Sam Smith for <em>In the Lonely Hour, </em>Beyoncé for <em>Beyoncé</em>, Ed Sheeran for <em>X</em>, and Pharrell Williams for <em>Girl</em>.</p> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3379084/lady_antebellum_2014.0.jpg"" alt=""lady antebellum"" data-chorus-asset-id=""3379084""></p> \n<p class=""caption""><span>The band Lady Antebellum won the Record of the Year Grammy in 2011 for their song ""Need You Now."" (Kevork Djansezian/Getty)</span></p> \n<h3>Record of the Year</h3> \n<p>The Record of the Year award is often confused with Song of the Year, since the two both reward individual songs. But the distinction is actually pretty simple to remember. The Record of the Year honors, first and foremost, the performing artist. Song of the Year honors the songwriter.</p> \n<p>Record of the Year, according to the <a href=""http://www.grammy.org/recording-academy/awards"">Grammy website</a>, is for ""for commercially released singles or tracks of new vocal or instrumental recordings. Tracks from a previous year's album may be entered, provided the track was not entered the previous year and provided the album did not win a Grammy""</p> \n<p>This award is given to the performing artist, the producers, the sound engineers, the master engineer, and the sound mixers.</p> \n<p>The Record of the Year award directly correlates with the way song copyrights are created. For every song, there are at least two copyrights: the first goes to the songwriter, and the second goes to the performer. Those copyrights determine how the contributors get paid, and how much they are paid. The people who make the sound of the song (not the words and melody), own the ""Sound <strong>Record</strong>ing"" copyright. Hence, Record of the Year.</p> \n<p><strong>How to remember it: </strong>Instead of thinking of ""record"" as a spinning record, think of it as a ""record-ing studio."" Everyone who would be in a recording studio during the creation of a song gets a Grammy for this award.</p> \n<p><strong>Fun fact: </strong>The Beatles were nominated for this award four times, for ""I Want to Hold Your Hand,"" ""Yesterday,"" ""Hey Jude,"" and ""Let It Be,"" but they never won.</p> \n<p><strong>The nominees for record of the year this year are: </strong>""Fancy,"" performed by Iggy Azalea and Charli XCX; ""Chandelier,"" performed by Sia; ""Stay With Me (Darkchild Version),"" performed by Sam Smith; ""Shake it Off,"" performed by Taylor Swift; and ""All About that Bass,"" performed by Meghan Trainor.</p> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""3377402"" alt=""Alicia Keys Grammy"" src=""https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3377402/alicia_keys_grammy.0.jpg""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Alicia Keys holds her 2002 Grammys, one of which was for Song of the Year (Vince Bucci/Getty)</p> \n<h3>Song of the Year</h3> \n<p>The Song of the Year Grammy doesn't actually honor the performers of songs. Instead, it goes to the people who wrote that song.</p> \n<p>It's easy to get this award confused with Record of the Year because there is often overlap in who is accepting the award. For example, if an artist has songwriting credit on their nominated song (as with every single song nominated this year), then the artist might accept the award and give the speech. But what they are receiving the award for is their construction of the song, not their performance.</p> \n<p>Legally, this side of the copyright is known as the mechanical copyright. (Its name stems from the invention of mechanical pianos. <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/1/22/7871221/aloe-blacc-streaming"">See here</a>.) That copyright is only given to the songwriter, as is this award.</p> \n<p><strong>How to remember it: </strong>Try and think of it as the ""Songwriter of the Year,"" rather than just Song.</p> \n<p><strong>Fun fact: </strong>Dominico Modungo and Franco Migliacci's 1959 winner ""<a href=""http://open.spotify.com/track/5inhCupC3jSuLQFssXSRDi"">Nel blu dipinto di blu (Volare)</a>"" is the only foreign-language song to win the award.</p> \n<p><strong>The nominees for song of the year this year are: </strong> ""All About that Bass,"" written by Kevin Kadish and Meghan Trainor; ""Chandelier,"" written by Sia Furler and Jesse Shatkin; ""Shake it Off,"" written by Max Martin, Shellback, and Taylor Swift; ""Stay with Me,"" written by James Napier, William Phillips, and Sam Smith; and ""Take Me to Church,"" written by Andrew Hozier-Byrne.</p> \n<h3><br></h3>",Music
A Grammy win isnâ€™t what it used to be,http://www.vox.com/2015/2/7/7993527/grammy-winners-performance,"The Grammys are now better known for huge, hyped performances than they're known for their winners.","<p>The music industry has been subject to seismic change in the last 15 years. People are consuming, finding, and purchasing music in new ways. The days of walking into a Sam Goody to purchase a physical album feel as anachronistic as dial tones.</p> \n<p>That puts the Grammys in a weird position. They've had to evolve to reflect the fact that whatever mass music culture there was is now splitting into smaller and smaller niches. In doing so, The Grammys are now better known for huge, hyped performances than they're known for their winners.</p> \n<p>But the question still remains: in this music economy, what's a Grammy worth?</p> \n<h3>What a Grammy does for album sales</h3> \n<p>The Grammy ""bump"" is the idea that winning an award can influence people to purchase the winning music. Historically, that bump has <a href=""http://www.grammy.com/news/grammy-effect-boosts-album-sales"">been </a>real for the Grammys.</p> \n<p>But people don't really purchase music anymore. A platinum album (one that sells more than 1 million copies) has become an anomaly. Taylor Swift's <em>1989</em> was the only album by a solo performer to go platinum last year. Fifteen years ago, that would have been completely absurd.<a href=""http://www.cleveland.com/entertainment/index.ssf/2014/11/19_albums_that_sold_one_millio.html""> In 2000</a>, 'NSYNC, Britney Spears, Eminem, the Backstreet Boys and even Limp Bizkit all released albums that sold one million or more albums in one week.</p> \n<p>Since people don't buy albums as much as they used to, the goal posts have changed. A Grammy win for an album today isn't going to have the same impact it did a decade ago.</p> \n<p>The biggest album bump seen after the 2014 Grammys was, <a href=""http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/5885814/grammy-awards-generate-sales-gains-on-billboard-charts"">according to Billboard</a>, the <em>2014 Grammy Nominees </em>compilation album. It sold 59,000 copies in the week following the awards. In 2005<strong>,</strong> Green Day’s <em>American Idiot</em> rose one spot to No. 2 and saw a 49 percent sales spike, with 202,000 albums sold. In 2003, Norah Jones's Grammy boost was 477,000 copies, when it sold 621,000 copies the <a href=""http://articles.latimes.com/2003/mar/06/news/wk-albums6"">week after the Grammys</a>.</p> \n<p>A Grammy will no longer make anyone a platinum powerhouse overnight, but it certainly used to.</p> \n<p>The Grammy boost is seen in different ways, like a nightly gross — the money you make during concerts. <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/zackomalleygreenburg/2012/02/08/the-grammy-bounce-how-much-is-an-award-really-worth/"">Forbes reported</a> in 2012 that artists like Taylor Swift, Bruno Mars, and Esperanza Spalding (the woman who beat Justin Bieber for Best New Artist in 2011) all saw their nightly gross exponentially grow after winning a Grammy.</p> \n<p>""In the year after grabbing Grammy No. 1, crooner Bruno Mars’ average nightly gross swelled from $130,000 to $202,000 (+55%); multi-instrumentalist Esperanza Spalding swung from $20,000 to $32,000 (+60%); and pop-country superstar Taylor Swift surged from $125,000 to $600,000 (+380%),"" <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/zackomalleygreenburg/2012/02/08/the-grammy-bounce-how-much-is-an-award-really-worth/"">Forbes reported</a>.</p> \n<p>That bump is also present in digital downloads. In the week following the 2014 Grammys, Katy Perry enjoyed a huge surge.</p> \n<p>""The top-selling song performed on the Grammy Awards is Katy Perry's 'Dark Horse,' featuring Juicy J, which retains the No. 1 slot on the Digital songs chart. It sold 294,000 downloads for the week — up 12% over the previous frame,"" <a href=""http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/5885814/grammy-awards-generate-sales-gains-on-billboard-charts"">Billboard reported</a>.</p> \n<p>The Grammy boost, at this point in time, does not calculate the rise in streaming rates per artist, though that certainly has to be on the horizon. But it's safe to say that without dramatic changes to the way artists are paid for plays on streaming sites, a Grammy bump will mean less and less financially for winners going forward.</p> \n<h3>The Grammys do help the people behind the winning songs.</h3> \n<p>There will be 83 Grammys handed out this year. That can, as <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/2/4/7976729/grammy-voting-process"">Kelsey McKinney pointed out</a>, diminish the rarity of being called a ""Grammy Award-winning"" anything.</p> \n<p>Artists like Taylor Swift and Beyoncé are bigger than the Grammys themselves. When Swift announced she would not be performing at the Grammys this year, it was met with general disappointment. This perhaps points to the growing consensus that the Grammys are more concerned with putting on a good show than the actual awards.</p> \n<p>But there are a world of people who aren't granted the same kind of exposure that Katy Perry gets: songwriters and producers. And for them, winning a Grammy can solidify a growing reputation raise their fees.</p> \n<p>David Banner, a producer for Lil' Wayne saw this happen in 2009.</p> \n<p>""Banner says his typical producer fee soared from $50,000 before winning the award to $100,000 or more afterwards; fellow producer Jim Jonsin’s jumped 90 percent in the wake of his win for producing Lil Wayne’s smash single <em>Lollipop,</em>"" <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/zackomalleygreenburg/2012/02/08/the-grammy-bounce-how-much-is-an-award-really-worth/"">Forbes</a> reported.</p> \n<h3>The Grammys are good for The Grammys</h3> \n<p>If everyone has a Grammy and Grammys don't boost album sales <em>that</em> much, then you could, with confidence, say that the biggest beneficiary of the Grammys are the Grammys.</p> \n<p>The Grammys have become the second most-watched awards show — right behind the Oscars. And the <a href=""http://www.cnn.com/2012/02/27/showbiz/tv/oscar-tv-ratings-ew/"">Grammys have been gaining</a> on the Oscars in recent years.</p> \n<p>This is because of the performances. The Grammys are, essentially, a televised Top 40 concert with a few breaks to hand out awards. This year, <a href=""http://www.grammy.com/news/rihanna-kanye-mccartney-added-to-57th-grammys"">Rihanna, Kanye West, and Paul McCartney</a> are performing their song  ""FourFiveSeconds<em>"" </em>together. It's probably going to be the performance (barring some earth-shattering something from Mary J. Blige and Sam Smith) everyone will be talking about. That performance will almost certainly overshadow whoever slinks off with ""Best Pop Album.""</p> \n<p>Yet, none of those three artists are nominated this year. Their performance is happening to publicize a new album, sure, but mostly, they will stand in the spotlight to bring viewers to CBS and the Grammys themselves. It's another way the Grammys have already won.</p>",Music
2015 Grammysâ€”who will win and who should win,http://www.vox.com/2015/2/8/8001669/Grammy-Awards-2015-predictions,This will be the year of Sam Smith at the Grammys.,"<p>This will be the year of Sam Smith at the Grammys.</p> \n<p>The artist is nominated in more categories than any other and, as a young, British singer-songwriter with a deeply soulful voice, is the second-coming of Adele. His only competition, really, is Beyoncé, who seems likely to win Album of the Year. But there are plenty of categories where Smith isn't nominated, so there's still room for the Grammys to spread the wealth.</p> \n<p>Here are our predictions for who will win (and should win) at the 2015 Grammys:</p> \n<h3>Album of the Year</h3> \n<p><iframe frameborder=""0"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/LXXQLa-5n5w"" height=""480"" width=""853""></iframe></p> \n<p><strong>Who will win: </strong>Beyoncé for <em>Beyoncé. </em>This album was released with in the middle of the night without a soul knowing, complete with 14 perfect music videos. But even without its attention-grabbing origin story, it's an incredible album. There are some pitfalls here and there on this album. The last few songs fail to reach the same pinnacles as early tracks such as ""Pretty Hurts"" and ""Drunk in Love."" But those early tracks are rightfully stunning, and the story surrounding the album is powerful enough that music industry voters will be attracted to it. Smith could win (God forbid), but bet on <em>Beyoncé.</em></p> \n<p><strong>Who should win: </strong>Beyoncé for <em>Beyoncé. </em>This masterfully mixed album spans the world of popular music today, leaping from R&amp;B to pop with alacrity, all the while showcasing Beyoncé's voice.</p> \n<h3>Record of the Year</h3> \n<p><iframe frameborder=""0"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/pB-5XG-DbAA"" height=""480"" width=""853""></iframe></p> \n<p><strong>Who will win:</strong> ""Stay With Me"" by Sam Smith. Historically, Record of the Year has gone to inoffensive but popular songs with melodies that climb from whispering lows to soaring highs. ""Stay With Me,"" a beautiful vocal performance laid atop two chords and a tambourine, fits that description almost perfectly. Several of the other nominated tracks are better here, but it won't matter. Smith seems likely to sweep several categories.</p> \n<p><strong>Who should win:</strong> ""<a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/8/19/6033483/taylor-swift-new-single-shake-it-off-video"">Shake it Off</a>"" by Taylor Swift. Swift and Max Martin created an infectiously produced earworm.</p> \n<h3>Song of the Year</h3> \n<p><strong>Who will win: </strong> ""Stay With Me"" by James Napier, William Phillips, and Sam Smith. This award goes to a song's songwriters. At first blush, ""Stay With Me,"" which repeats the same three words over and over again and features a fairly simple musical arrangement, seems an odd fit. But it will win because so little of this worldwide hit <em>sounds</em> produced. The song's simplicity works for it, making it easy to believe most of the talent on display stems from the songwriters.</p> \n<p><strong>Who should win:</strong> ""Chandelier"" by Sia Furler and Jesse Shatkin. Sia has always been a beautiful songwriter, but ""Chandelier"" is a knockout. Lyrically, it's heart-wrenching. Musically, it sweeps beautifully from the pits of despair to the heights of exaltation.</p> \n<h3>Best New Artist</h3> \n<p><strong>Who will win:</strong> Sam Smith. And this is the one category where the huge praise heaped on Smith's young shoulders makes sense. None of the other artists nominated have had the cultural dominance Smith has enjoyed. His only real competition in that regard is Iggy Azalea, and we're betting the Academy doesn't want the headache of rewarding her in such a prominent category.</p> \n<p><strong>Who should win:</strong> A surprise Haim win would be welcome, but this is one category Smith deserves to win.</p> \n<h3>Best Pop Duo/Group Performance</h3> \n<p><iframe frameborder=""0"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/O-zpOMYRi0w"" height=""480"" width=""853""></iframe></p> \n<p><strong>Who will win: </strong>""Fancy"" by Iggy Azalea and Charli XCX. The descending, syncopated bass line that introduces ""Fancy"" is the most iconic sound of 2014. And even though Azalea raps throughout, the catchy hook from Charli XCX makes this a solid pop song. The production by The Invisible Men allows two incredibly distinct sounds (and songs) to blend together into one of 2014's biggest hits.</p> \n<p><strong>Who should win:</strong> ""Dark Horse"" by Katy Perry. This soaring song seems like it came out years ago. It seems unlikely the Academy will honor it this far afterward.</p> \n<h3>Best Pop Solo Performance</h3> \n<p><strong>Who will win:</strong> Sam Smith. See also: the reasons he will win every other category.</p> \n<p><strong>Who should win: </strong>Sia for ""Chandelier."" The performance award technically rewards producers, in addition to vocalists, but c'mon. Listen to Sia's voice vaulting around the vocal register. That's the most impressive performance here.</p> \n<h3>Best Pop Vocal Performance</h3> \n<p><iframe frameborder=""0"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/g5qU7p7yOY8"" height=""480"" width=""853""></iframe></p> \n<p><strong>Who will win:</strong> Sam Smith.</p> \n<p><strong>Who should win</strong>: Ariana Grande. ""Love Me Harder"" is a more difficult song vocally than ""Stay with Me,""and it should be rewarded.</p> \n<h3>Best Rap Album</h3> \n<p><strong>Who will win:</strong> Iggy Azalea, allowing the world to explode in controversy. Despite the fact that this category features several solid albums, none of them are by huge names. Had Kendrick Lamar released his new album, Azalea might have lost, but instead, she's the lone A-list star, and the Grammys often reward familiarity. <em>The New Classic</em> is not a bad album, but on its strongest tracks, (""Fancy,"" ""Black Widow,"" and  ""New Bitch"") it's closer to pop than rap.</p> \n<p><strong>Who should win:</strong> Common's <em>Nobody Smiling </em>is both a great album and one no one will mistake for a pop album any time soon.</p> \n<h3>Best Rap Song</h3> \n<p><iframe frameborder=""0"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/I2bBZvSPpOo"" height=""480"" width=""853""></iframe></p> \n<p><strong>Who will win: </strong>Drake for ""0 to 100/The Catch Up,"" one of the best songs released in 2014. Drake varies the speed of his flow throughout, which keeps the cadence of the song constantly shifting and the listener constantly guessing.</p> \n<p><strong>Who should win:</strong> ""i"" by Kendrick Lamar. Lamar turns over a new lead, melodically and thematically, here.</p> \n<h3>Best Rap Performance</h3> \n<p><iframe frameborder=""0"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/8aShfolR6w8"" height=""480"" width=""853""></iframe></p> \n<p><strong>Who will win: </strong>Kendrick Lamar for ""i."" Lamar long ago proved he can rhyme in a way that's both catchy and emotionally affecting. But on ""i,"" Lamar extends that magic to a new thematic tone. It's not often that a rap song as filled with raw positivity as ""i"" maintains its complicated rhythms, but that's what Lamar manages here.</p> \n<p><strong>Who should win:</strong> Kendrick Lamar.</p> \n<h3>Best Rap/Sung Collaboration</h3> \n<p><iframe frameborder=""0"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/BBAtAM7vtgc"" height=""480"" width=""853""></iframe></p> \n<p><strong>Who will win:</strong> ""BOUND 2."" Kanye West will never get over the reality that <em>Graduation</em> didn't win Album of the Year, but that doesn't mean the Academy ignores him. He'll win here. ""BOUND 2"" is exactly the kind of song the Recording Academy likes to reward: it's popular, it took a risk, and the recurring ""uh-huh honey"" sure is catchy.</p> \n<p><strong>Who should win:</strong> Sure. Give this one to Kanye.</p> \n<h3>Best Alternative Music Album</h3> \n<p><strong>Who will win: </strong><em>Lazaretto </em>by Jack White. It's possible Arcade Fire, popular with the Academy, wins here, but Jack White is also beloved. <em>Lazaretto</em> has many backing musicians (meaning lots of people in the Academy will have worked on it or know someone who did), and White is one of the best rock composers working today. Even though this isn't his best album, it should be enough to put him over the top.</p> \n<p><strong>Who should win</strong>: <em>St. Vincent </em>by St. Vincent. This is an unstoppable album that builds momentum all the way through.</p> \n<h3>Best Rock Album</h3> \n<p><strong>Who will win: </strong>U2.<em> </em>It almost doesn't matter what this album sounds like, because U2 is such an Academy darling. Plus, it was in the news, thanks to everyone having it forced upon them by Apple. <em>Songs of Innocence</em> wasn't the best album produced last year by any means, but it's full of nostalgia.</p> \n<p><strong>Who should win:</strong> <em>Turn Blue</em> by The Black Keys</p> \n<h3>Best Rock Song and Best Rock Performance</h3> \n<p><iframe frameborder=""0"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/iZZUY32iCzU"" height=""480"" width=""853""></iframe></p> \n<p><strong>Who will win: </strong>The Black Keys for ""Fever."" The Recording Academy likes The Black Keys, and ""Fever"" shows why. It has brilliant chord progressions for every instrument. The bass line is groovy, the keyboard is symphonic, and the vocals don't lag from verse to chorus.</p> \n<p><strong>Who should win: </strong>""Gimme Something Good"" by Ryan Adams. I didn't love Adams' album, but ""Gimme Something Good"" is an excellently executed song.</p> \n<h3>Best Country Album</h3> \n<p><strong>Who will win:</strong> Eric Church's album is darker than most country, mixing up genres to showcase that darkness. It's also a dazzling example of how to build an album front to back.</p> \n<p><strong>Who should win:</strong> Miranda Lambert for <em>Platinum. </em>She's never won a Grammy, and <em>Platinum</em> raises the kind of hell that female country artists are increasingly famous for.</p> \n<h3>Best Country Duo/Group Performance</h3> \n<p><iframe frameborder=""0"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/o4Yzj-m_SBk"" height=""480"" width=""853""></iframe></p> \n<p><strong>Who will win:</strong> ""Something Bad"" by Carrie Underwood and Miranda Lambert. Both Underwood and Lambert have perfected songs about a woman chewing out her romantic partner separately over the years. This song brings them together to do just that, with fantastic results. It's simple musically, with three chords and heavy drums, but vocally, it's incredible.</p> \n<p><strong>Who should win: </strong>""Something Bad""</p> \n<h3>Best Country Solo Performance</h3> \n<p><strong>Who will win:</strong> Carrie Underwood's ""Something in the Water"" lets her alternate between angry yelps and the belting highs of the chorus. It's a terrific performance</p> \n<p><strong>Who should win: </strong>Miranda Lambert will never win this category, but ""Automatic"" is a great song.</p> \n<h3>Best Country Song</h3> \n<p><iframe frameborder=""0"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/U8TsAh-zYFI"" height=""480"" width=""853""></iframe></p> \n<p><strong>Who will win:</strong> Glen Campbell's subtle, emotional ""I'm Not Gonna Miss You."" The subdued piano intro and a male country star slipping into the higher end of his vocal range are two surefire signs of a Grammy win coming. And this sad ode to broken relationships is a nice turn by Campbell.</p> \n<p><strong>Who should win</strong>: Not Kenny Chesney's ""American Kids."" That song is bad.</p> \n<h3>Best R&amp;B Album</h3> \n<p><strong>Who will win: </strong>Toni Braxton and Babyface for <em>Love, Marriage &amp; Divorce. </em>It's hard to imagine the Grammys not awarding a Braxton/Babyface Collaboration. <em>Love, Marriage &amp; Divorce</em> is a slow-building album that channels R&amp;B's past of breathy vocals with the future of complex backing beats and rising melodies.</p> \n<p><strong>Who should win: </strong>I really liked Aloe Blacc's quietly haunting <em>Lift Your Spirit, </em>but it lacks the name recognition to win over Grammy voters.</p> \n<h3>Best R&amp;B Song</h3> \n<p><iframe frameborder=""0"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/p1JPKLa-Ofc"" height=""480"" width=""853""></iframe></p> \n<p><strong>Who will win</strong>: Beyoncé's ""Drunk in Love"" takes this. It's the most popular song in the category, yes, but it's also a song that is genuinely loved. Yes, it features Jay Z rapping in one verse, but it's still, unmistakably, an R&amp;B track.</p> \n<p><strong>Who should win: </strong>""Good Kisser"" by Usher is a great, hidden hit, and it's also a purer pick for the R&amp;B category.</p> \n<h3>Best R&amp;B Performance</h3> \n<p><strong>Who will win</strong>: ""Drunk in Love"" wins again here.</p> \n<p><strong>Who should win: </strong>""Drunk in Love.""</p> \n<h3>Best Urban Contemporary Album</h3> \n<p><strong>Who will and should win: </strong>Must we repeat ourselves? Beyoncé.</p>",Music

Watch: the best part of Annie Lennox's breathtaking Grammy performance,http://www.vox.com/2015/2/8/8002933/grammy-performances-2015-lennox,Wow.,"<p>On a night that featured spectacles like Madonna dancing with human bulls, pop princess Ariana Grande showing off a softer side, Kanye West singing and conjuring dark magic, and Pharrell and Hans Zimmer teaming up for a ghoulish rendition of ""Happy,"" the only Grammy performance that we'll remember (and perhaps cherish) for the next year was Annie Lennox's rock cover of <a target=""new"" href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TrSMaOZm3Y"">""I Put a Spell on You.""</a></p> \n<p>Lennox came on stage during the last third of Hozier's ""Take Me to Church."" Their duet was good, but the mixing seemed a bit off — the vocals were overshadowed by the instruments in a song that's very much about the purity and clarity of Hozier's voice. Then it began to right itself when the song transitioned to Lennox's ""Spell.""</p> \n<p>Written by <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwXai-sgM-s"" target=""_blank"">Screamin' Jay Hawkins</a>, ""Spell"" is one of those songs that takes guts to perform, because it'll always be compared to Nina Simone's definitive cover.

Kristen Wiig danced in Siaâ€™s Grammy performance.

From her music video for the inescapable song ""<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vjPBrBU-TM"">Chandelier</a>"" to live performances where her face is obscured, Sia is worth watching because you never know what might happen next.</p> \n<p>Her performance at the 2015 Grammys was no exception. Shia LaBeouf, who actually stars in her Sia's music video for ""Elastic Heart"", kicked things off by introducing Sia with what appears to be a ""letter"" that mostly just turns into a LaBeouf ramble.</p> \n<p> \n<script type=""text/javascript""><!-- \nOO.ready(function() { OO.Player.create('ooyalaplayer', 'xib2k4czoRNiA6R8__piDN-RqMkx2IFj'); }); \n// --></script> \n</p> \n<noscript>&lt;div&gt;Please enable Javascript to watch this video&lt;/div&gt;</noscript> \n<p>After that bizarre intro, there's a mad scramble to make sense of what's about to happen. As your eyes adjust to the busy set (which sorta looks like a modern day version of Miss Havisham's chambers from <i>Great Expectations</i>) and spot Maddie Ziegler (the star of Sia's ""Chandelier"" video), you notice she's paired with a taller woman who happens to be … Kristen Wiig.</p> \n<p>It's disarming primarily because Wiig is just so very good at emoting. She nails the contemporary choreography. <span>Wiig looks like a pro. </span></p> \n<p><span></span><span>But then you also have to peel the layers back — we usually see Wiig when she's funnier, goofier, and cracking jokes. And seeing her perform some visceral and powerful movements — at one point, she pantomimes a punch to her mouth — is spell-binding. </span></p> \n<p>Wiig's performance works on so many levels. It's another testament to the creative way Sia has redefined the way we think of live performances.</p>",Music

There were three-and-a-half hours of performances on top of performances, spools of pink tulle draped around Rihanna's waist, and a strange and grand moment from the one and only Kanye West.</p> \n<p>For those of us who didn't have hours to spare and prefer an abridged version, h<span>ere is a brief rundown of the show: </span></p> \n<h3>The big winner was Sam Smith</h3> \n<p>There was no clean sweep in the Big Four awards – Best New Artist, Record of the Year, Song of the Year, and Album of the Year – but Sam Smith came very close. Smith took home every Big Four award except Album of the Year (which went to Beck – more on that soon). He beat out the likes of Taylor Swift, Hozier, Haim, Iggy Azalea, and others throughout the night. He also took home the Grammy in Best Pop Vocal Album, bringing his overall tally to four.</p> \n<p>Because he was a relative newbie to the awards scene, <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/2/8/8002709/grammys-2015-sam-smith"" target=""_blank"">Smith was not as good</a> as Taylor Swift or Beyoncé in faking happiness for the winner when he lost. But this might be a moot point, since the crooner didn't lose very often on Grammy night.</p> \n<h3>Beck pulled the biggest upset in winning Album of the Year</h3> \n<p>Each of the nominees in the Album of the Year category had gigantic years … except for the eventual winner. Pharrell dominated early with the unstoppable hit ""Happy,"" Beyoncé's self-titled visual album cemented her status as a music icon, and Sam Smith and Ed Sheeran both made names for themselves with <i>In the Lonely Hour</i> and <i>X</i> respectively.</p> \n<p>But the Grammy did not go to any of these people. Instead, it went to Beck's <i>Morning Phase. </i>Even Beck was astonished that he won the award:</p> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""3390608"" alt=""download__11_.0.gif"" src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3390608/download__11_.0.gif""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">The Grammys</p> \n<h3>Annie Lennox, Sia, and Kristen Wiig stole the night with their performances</h3> \n<p>There were so many performances on Sunday night you may have forgotten there were actual awards being given out.</p> \n<p>Most of these performances were serviceable – Madonna danced around with muscular men dressed as bulls, Gwen Stefani and Adam Levine had a pretty good, understated duet, and Pharrell had a strange, menacing take on ""Happy."" But the show-stopping moment of the night was <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/2/8/8002933/grammy-performances-2015-lennox"" target=""_blank"">Annie Lennox</a> performing ""<a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/2/8/8002933/grammy-performances-2015-lennox"" target=""_blank"">I Put a Spell on You</a>.""

If Lennox's performance worked because she lived up to her status as a music icon, Sia's performance worked because it completely defied everything we thought we knew about Kristen Wiig by having her dance. Wiig evoked all kinds of visceral, painful, and joyous emotions in her dance — a far cry from the goofy comedic actress we're so often used to seeing.</p> \n<h3>Prince said something super powerful</h3> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3390854/Screen_Shot_2015-02-09_at_1.00.27_AM.0.png"" alt=""Screen_Shot_2015-02-09_at_1.00.27_AM.0.png"" data-chorus-asset-id=""3390854""></p> \n<p>Prince was tasked with introducing the Album of the Year.

His words were accompanied by a hefty applause.</p> \n<h3>Kanye West made nice with Taylor Swift, but is also very mad Beyoncé didn't win Album of the Year</h3> \n<p>The weirdest moment of the night was when <a href=""http://www.salon.com/2015/02/09/watch_the_most_awkward_grammys_duet_ever_jessie_j_and_tom_jones/"" target=""_blank"">Jessie J</a> was invited to sing things. After that, the second weirdest moment of the night came toward the end of the show.

Voters who were going to vote for <i>Beyoncé </i>could have swung to Sam Smith or Pharrell, or even Ed Sheeran's camp. All of those nominees had voter bases that overlapped substantially.</p> \n<p>We've seen this time and time again, historically. Whenever a single rock band is nominated for Album of the Year, that band takes home the trophy, more often than not.</p> \n<p>In 2011, Arcade Fire won<b> </b>Album of the Year over Katy Perry, Lady Gaga, Eminem, and Lady Antebellum. In 2000, Santana beat the Backstreet Boys, TLC, the Dixie Chicks, and Diana Krall. From 1986–1988, a string of rock performances (U2, Phil Collins, Paul Simon) beat out pop stars like Whitney Houston, Barbra Streisand, Michael Jackson, Prince, and Sting.</p> \n<p>Beck's win isn't surprising, even if it was disappointing for some.</p> \n<h3>Why do so many people think Beyoncé should have won?</h3> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/671104/beyonce_vmas.0.jpg"" alt=""beyonce"" data-chorus-asset-id=""671104""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">beyonce performs at the 2014 VMAs ( ROBYN BECK/ Getty)</p> \n<p><i>Beyoncé, </i>the artist's fifth studio album, dropped in the middle of the night in December of 2013, complete with 17 music videos. The album sent shock waves through American music, not only because it was such a surprise, but because it was so <i>good</i>.</p> \n<p><i>Beyoncé </i>revealed every side of the pop star that she had hinted at on previous albums. Here, she was angrier, happier, sexier, and stronger than ever before.</p> \n<p>From the opening song, ""Pretty Hurts,"" Beyoncé set the tone: this was an album as complex emotionally as it was sonically. Instead of following the formula for pop music greatness, <i>Beyoncé </i>completely rejected it. The album sounded, at turns, like an R&amp;B, adult contemporary, and pure pop album, sometimes within a single song.</p> \n<p>Beyoncé's fans (the Beyhive), are beyond devout — they're fanatic. So on some level, the outrage is an emotional response to a feeling of loss among her fans. But on another level, Beyoncé created an incredible, masterful album that proved a cultural sensation, and here she was losing to an old rock-and-roll boy whose album didn't reach that level of prominence.</p> \n<p>It helps to compare the albums. Let's look at Beck's:</p> \n<h3>Is Beck's <i>Morning Phase </i>that good of an album?</h3> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""3391714"" alt=""beck coachella"" src=""https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3391714/beck_coachella.0.jpg""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Beck at Coachella in 2014. (Karl Walter/Getty)</p> \n<p><i>Morning Phase </i>is a fine album, but it's also complacent. Early in his career, Beck lived in a murky cross-genre land that interested listeners because it made them uncomfortable. He added modern synths to classic blues sounds. He made references to his R&amp;B heroes from Serge Gainsbourg to Gordon Lightfoot. He was bold, and he probably should have won Album of the Year years ago, perhaps in 2001 for his truly incredible <i>Midnite Vultures</i>.</p> \n<p>His competition that year was Radiohead's <i>Kid A, </i>Eminiem's <i>The Marshall Mathers LP, </i>and <i>You're the One</i> by Paul Simon. All of those albums lost to<b> </b>jazz rock band Steely Dan because their votes were divided.</p> \n<p>On <i>Morning Phase, </i>Beck is calmer than he's ever been. There is none of the grit of 1996's <i>Odelay </i>and none of the straightforward emotion of 2002's <i>Sea Change </i>or 2005's <i>Guero</i>.</p> \n<p>Instead, <i>Morning Phase </i>oscillates between sleepiness and an emotionless void of sound. Even on songs like ""Say Goodbye,"" where Beck is supposed to invoke the emotional hardships of a breakup, it feels like he's shrugging his pain off.</p> \n<p><iframe frameborder=""0"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/3B8uTd4Tfno"" height=""480"" width=""853""></iframe></p> \n<p><i>Morning Phase </i>is by no means the best Beck album, but it <i>sounds </i>truly incredible. The singer's voice is stronger on it than it has ever been and it shines, particularly on the second song, ""Morning.""</p> \n<p>The album's production quality is also strong. These songs, though emotionless and sometimes plodding, are expertly mixed and don't cause a listener to stumble at all. Part of that smooth surface is why Beck's emotions get buried, but it's the kind of production Recording Academy members hold in high regard.</p> \n<h3>Wait. How did Beck get nominated for Album of the Year?</h3> \n<p>Now is a good time to don your skeptic hat and remember that the Grammys are formally, openly rigged. The nominees for Album of the Year, though voted on by Recording Academy members, are ultimately chosen by a <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/2/4/7976729/grammy-voting-process"" target=""_blank"">secret committee</a> that the Recording Academy formed in the 1990s to review voters' choices.</p> \n<p><span>To the Grammys' credit, this committee has a point. Before the committee was established in 1995, there were several very strange (if not horrible) choices for Album of the Year. Take 1985s pick of Lionel Richie's </span><em style=""line-height: 28.4624996185303px; background-color: #f1f3f2;""><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0013F2BW6?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=slatmaga-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0013F2BW6"" sl-processed=""1"">Can't Slow Down</a> </em><span>Album of the Year over Bruce Springsteen's </span><em style=""line-height: 28.4624996185303px; background-color: #f1f3f2;""><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00138CS6C?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=slatmaga-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00138CS6C"" sl-processed=""1"">Born in the USA</a></em><span> and Prince's </span><em style=""line-height: 28.4624996185303px; background-color: #f1f3f2;""><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0011Z51QG?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=slatmaga-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0011Z51QG"" sl-processed=""1"">Purple Rain</a></em><span>. Richie was far from the best choice that year, and his win helped create the public perception that the Grammys were cut off from what ""good music"" meant. </span></p> \n<p>This, however, wasn't the inciting incident for the creation of the committee. What pushed the Recording Academy over the edge was Tony Bennett's <i>MTV Unplugged </i> Album of the Year win in 1995 over Eric Clapton, Bonnie Raitt, and Zubin Mehta.</p> \n<p>This secret committee reviews the top four awards (Album of the Year, Record of the Year, Song of the Year, and Best New Artist), as well as some of the larger genre categories, and makes any changes it sees fit.</p> \n<p>Beck won the popular vote fair and square because he had no genre competition. But whether he was nominated fairly (whether <i>any</i> artist was nominated fairly) is something to be skeptical about.</p> \n<p>If you're looking for someone to blame for the Album of the Year Grammy, don't pick Beck, a masterful musician who has produced nine good albums in the past two decades and genuinely deserved to win this award at some point (just maybe not right now). Blame the anonymous committee that decides who gets to be a nominee for Album of the Year to begin with.</p>",Music

New albums will come out on Fridays instead of Tuesdays now. Blame Beyonce.,http://www.vox.com/2015/2/26/8116201/friday-new-albums-beyonce,Tuesdays are no longer a good enough day to release new music in the United States.,"<p>Beyoncé is certainly a trendsetter in many ways. And now, the 2013 surprise Friday drop of her album <em>Beyoncé </em>hasn't just created a ripple effect through popular culture. It's part of the reason the record industry has decided Tuesdays are no longer a good enough day to release new music in the United States.</p> \n<p><a href=""http://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/retail/6487290/industry-sets-friday-as-global-record-release-day"">Billboard reports</a> that, after seven months of negotiations, the record industry has decided that it will release albums across the world on Fridays, starting this summer. This will completely change the way music is distributed and reformat the charts for everyone. It could also be the key to combatting international piracy problems.</p> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3450328/records.0.jpg"" alt=""record store"" data-chorus-asset-id=""3450328""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">A man's fingers running along the sleeves of vinyl in a record (Getty)</p> \n<h3>Why were albums released on Tuesdays?</h3> \n<p>There is literally no good reason for albums to be released on Tuesdays. The United Kingdom and France release albums on Mondays. And Germans and Australians have been releasing their albums on Fridays for some time.</p> \n<p>In the United States, albums have been released on Tuesdays<a href=""http://books.google.com/books/about/Is_Tiny_Dancer_Really_Elton_s_Little_Joh.html?id=ROyzSRT6nF0C""> since the 1980s</a>.  Before that, whenever a record arrived at a store, employees just put it on the shelf. What that meant was that some artists had a clear advantage over others, depending on when their album arrived. Creating a standard day evened the playing field.</p> \n<p>Tuesday is also a date that is firmly rooted in a culture that printed, recorded, shipped, unboxed, and bought albums in their physical form. When albums weren't digital downloads, they required a lot of manpower. By placing the release date on Tuesday, record labels had the entire weekend to ship new inventory across the country to record stores, and stores had a full non-weekend day (Monday) to unpack albums and prepare the store for shelving.</p> \n<p>For artists, the benefit of releasing an album on the standard American Tuesday release date is that it makes your album sales look better. Billboard creates the top album and singles charts every week, and those are published on Wednesday and track sales from Tuesday to Tuesday</p> \n<p>What this means is that if you release your album on Friday, like Beyoncé did with her 2013 surprise drop, you'll only get four days of album sales to count as your ""first week."" So <em>Beyoncé </em>didn't sell a million copies in her first Billboard ""week"" to make sales history, even though she actually did sell one million copies in her first calendar week.</p> \n<p>For an artist of Beyoncé's caliber, it's a loss that doesn't really matter. But for a smaller or up-and-coming artist, making a top 10 or even top 100 sales list can really change your career.</p> \n<p>That wasn't always the case. The Billboard Top 100 chart has been around since the 1940s and used to be tracked on the standard American week (Sunday to Sunday). It was only after the standard Tuesday was introduced that Billboard switched when it counted. So really, that benefit could easily have happened on any day of the week.</p> \n<p>Mostly, though, Tuesday is just what the record industry <em>did</em>. In fact, <a href=""http://www.billboard.com/articles/business/6214409/record-industry-considering-a-standard-global-album-release-day"">Billboard reported </a>that the <a href=""http://a2im.org/"">American Association of Independent Music</a> (which fights for independent American labels) and <a href=""http://deptofrecordstores.com/"">Department of Record Stores</a> (which represents independent record stores) both wanted the global release date to shift to the American standard of Tuesday during recent negotiations.</p> \n<p>It was the day we Americans crowned for new music, for better or for worse. Yet Tuesdays lost out to Friday after the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI) found that consumers polled <a href=""http://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/retail/6487290/industry-sets-friday-as-global-record-release-day"">preferred new music to come out on Friday or Saturday.</a></p> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3450332/beyonce_grammys.0.jpg"" alt=""beyonce grammys"" data-chorus-asset-id=""3450332""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Beyoncé's surprise album dropped on a Friday  (FREDERIC J. BROWN/Getty)</p> \n<h3>So why is the date changing?</h3> \n<p>In short, piracy. When albums came out on different days in different countries pre-internet, it didn't matter. Someone in Germany might read a review in an international newspaper about a US release and simply wait four days to buy the album in their own country. But now, the world is smaller, connected by the internet, and more impatient. As soon as an album is released, it can be uploaded and illegally shared around the world.</p> \n<p>""Music fans live in the digital world of today,"" Frances Moore, the head of the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry, the group that represents record labels worldwide, <a href=""http://www.ifpi.org/news/Viewpoint-by-Frances-Moore-on-the-benefits-of-Global-Release-Day"">wrote</a> in a press release. ""Their love for new music doesn't recognize national borders. They want music when it's available on the internet — not when it's ready to be released in their country. An aligned global release day puts an end to the frustration of not being able to access releases in their country when the music is available in another country.""</p> \n<p>The subtext of this quote is that ""the frustration"" people are experiencing isn't leading them to angrily await a new release by stomping around their room. The delay just means that instead of buying or legally streaming an album and the artist being compensated for that, a fan would illegally download the album and listen right then. That's bad for the record industry and artists because they lose money, and it's bad for fans because accessing new music is inconvenient and, well, illegal.</p> \n<p>The idea, then, is that if every single country releases albums on the same exact day, then there will be no need to pirate an album because everyone will have access. This, of course, does not take time zones into account, but it could be something.</p> \n<p>As with any change, there is backlash to this motion. As Martin Mills, a founder and chairman of the Beggars Group, a British record label conglomerate,  <a href=""https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/6480560/martin-mills-brian-message-manifesto-plan-music-retail-growth"">told Billboard</a>, ""I fear this move will also lead to a market in which the mainstream dominates, and the niche, which can be tomorrow's mainstream, is further marginalized. I fear it will further cement the dominance of the few — and that is exactly what it is intended to do.""</p> \n<p>This viewpoint is in direct opposition to the original formulation of a standard date, which was meant to level the playing field. This concern is placed in the idea that it might be harder for international mid-level bands to break through on the United States market because the ""new music"" hype would be dominated by the larger, more mainstream releases.</p> \n<p>This, however, seems unlikely, because smaller bands have always had to compete with larger mainstream artists and have found fans of their own. Also, the impact streaming services can have on premiering new releases— like the existing ""New Music Tuesday"" on Spotify—could actually help smaller bands by placing their songs next to larger mainstream releases.</p> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/675842/cd_sales.0.jpg"" alt=""cd sales"" data-chorus-asset-id=""675842""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Music Industry Feels Strain As Consumers Go Online ( Scott Barbour/Getty)</p> \n<h3>Is moving albums' release dates a good idea?</h3> \n<p>To prevent piracy, maybe. If the success of streaming platforms has taught us anything, it's that if you make access to music convenient for consumers, <a href=""http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/news/10187400/Spotify-and-Netflix-curb-music-and-film-piracy.html"">piracy rates will drop</a>. Streaming isn't perfect by any means, and there are still large debates about how it pays artists, but at least artists get paid. And they certainly aren't paid at all for illegal downloads.</p> \n<p>For music fans, though, Tuesday has always been album day. In general, Tuesday is easily the worst day of the week. All of the energy from Monday is gone, and Tuesday is too far from Friday to have any hope. Tuesdays are really terrible. The only thing good about Tuesdays was that at least we got a few new albums that we could celebrate or bemoan.</p> \n<p>But soon, we won't even have that. By moving albums to Fridays, the record industry has ruined Tuesday once and for all.</p>",Music

5 songs from alt-rock band Wolf Alice you need toÂ hear,http://www.vox.com/2015/2/27/8121155/wolf-alice-dc,"After three EP releases, the band is releasing their first full album","<p>British alternative rock band Wolf Alice is starting to take a turn towards pop. After three EP releases, the band is releasing their first full album, <em>My Love is Cool</em> this summer -- and it's less angry and more approachable than any of their previous work.  I chatted with Ellie Rowsell, the band's lead vocalist, about five songs that define Wolf Alice's new sound:</p> \n<h3>""Bros,"" 2013</h3> \n<p><iframe src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/87228943&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false"" frameborder=""no"" scrolling=""no"" height=""166"" width=""100%""></iframe></p> \n<p>The beginning of Wolf Alice's sound can be traced to the band's first self-titled EP, <em>Wolf Alice, </em>release in 2010<em>. </em>At the time, the band was only made up of two people, Rowsell and Joff Oddie. Later, the band expanded to include a bassist and a drummer, and that's when Rowsell wrote her first song for the group called, ""Bros.""</p> \n<p>""I wrote this song when I was nineteen. It was about my friend that I’ve been friends with since I was three. It’s kind of about kid friendship,"" Rowsell told me. ""Lyrically, I think it resonates with people because it’s just quite sentimental. What you do when you have a best friend.""</p> \n<p> </p> \n<h3>""Blush,"" 2013</h3> \n<p><iframe src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/109146383&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false"" frameborder=""no"" scrolling=""no"" height=""166"" width=""100%""></iframe></p> \n<p>In 2013, Wolf Alice's first EP <em>Blush</em> became a little gentler in its sound. The guitar was softer and twangier than on ""Bros,"" and Rowsell's voice rose into a higher soprano. ""Don’t chicken out, it’s all good/ You’re allowed to be what you could./ Punch drunk, dumb struck, pot luck happy happy,"" she sang. It's a mess of words that don't make perfect sense, but rhythmically, it works.<strong> </strong></p> \n<p>""We got the lyric by opening pages in the dictionary and stuff,"" Roswell explained to me. ""That’s where that dumbstruck thing came form. It’s been in loads of different forms besides the current one, but I think this is it's best form.""</p> \n<p> </p> \n<h3>""White Leather,"" 2013</h3> \n<p><iframe src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/76803662&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false"" frameborder=""no"" scrolling=""no"" height=""166"" width=""100%""></iframe></p> \n<p>""White Leather"" isn't Wolf Alice's most famous song, but it's one of their strongest, and is the second track on their single release, Fluffy. ""This is our sad B-side. It’s one of our favorite songs. We never felt like it got enough coverage,"" Roswell told me about the 2013 song.</p> \n<p>""It makes me feel sad. It’s about being on the outsides of the group looking in. It never quite caught it."" White Leather has softer lyrics than the bands newer work, or as Rowsell joked:</p> \n<p>""I’ve always described [our sound] as the party and the hangover. ""Giant Peach"" is the party, and songs like ""White Leather"" are the hangover. ""</p> \n<p> </p> \n<h3>""Moaning Lisa Smile,"" 2014</h3> \n<p><iframe src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/142689143&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false"" frameborder=""no"" scrolling=""no"" height=""166"" width=""100%""></iframe></p> \n<p>""Moaning Lisa Smile"" is a song about Lisa Simpson of the animated series <em>The Simpsons</em>, Rowsell told to me.</p> \n<p>""We wanted to write about what she might be feeling when she was 18 or something,"" she said.</p> \n<p>This song is probably Wolf Alice's most popular song. It found placement on HBO's series <em>The Leftovers</em> this year, and garnered Wolf Alice a larger fan base outside of their native Britain.</p> \n<p>""We used to sing Neil Young in a screamo way. It was a fun cover that song in a way that felt so different, and then we were like ""actually this riff is quite good,"""" Rowsell told me. That melody became the opening riff for ""Moaning Lisa Smile,"" which shifts between a gentle picking pattern and a heavy handed electric guitar pounding in your ears.</p> \n<p>""Moaning Lisa Smile"" embodies the bridge between the new and the old Wolf Alice. Here is a song with the angry roots of their earlier work, and the catchy, singable choruses of what seems to be Wolf Alice's future.</p> \n<p> </p> \n<h3>""Giant Peach,"" 2015</h3> \n<p><iframe src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/192747351&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false"" frameborder=""no"" scrolling=""no"" height=""166"" width=""100%""></iframe></p> \n<p>""Giant Peach"" is the first glimpse of Wolf Alice's forthcoming album. It feels cleaner  and more pop than anything the band produced in the past, but it also has a <em>ton </em>of energy.</p> \n<p>""It was our favorite thing to play in rehearsal,"" Rowsell admitted.  ""I felt a rush from it. It’s really dancy and kind of aggressive.""</p> \n<p>The first minute of the song is completely instrumental and builds in anger and momentum as it heads into Rowsell's chanting clean vocals. ""We kind of wanted a heavy, instrumental type song that we would eventually put vocals to. It’s kind of an amalgamation of quite a few ideas that we had, but I think it really works.""</p> \n<p>""Giant Peach"" is the future of Wolf Alice's sound, Rowsell explained. <strong> </strong>It's not only technically more advanced than any of their previous work, it had a hell of a lot more heart.</p> \n<p>Wolf Alice is playing at <a href=""http://www.930.com/event/761679-wolf-alice-washington/"">U Street Music Hall on February 27 at 7:00 p.m</a>. as part of the 9:30 presents series. <a href=""http://wolfalice.co.uk/"">You can find the rest of their tour dates here.</a></p>",Music
The 7 best songs of February,http://www.vox.com/2015/2/28/8124219/best-songs-2015,February has been dominated by familiar voices,"<p>2015 is off to a good start for music. Stellar singer-songwriters like Natalie Prass blew us away in January, but February has been dominated by familiar voices — like Sufjan Stevens and Drake — who dropped great new hits.</p> \n<p>Here are the seven best songs:</p> \n<h3>Drake, ""Energy""</h3> \n<p><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/EZIc8EMv_CA"" frameborder=""0"" height=""480"" width=""853""></iframe></p> \n<p>Drake's <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/2/13/8035363/drake-surprise-album"">surprise mixtape</a> has been killing the charts for the last three weeks; it's also an album that fully shows who he is as a person and an artist.<b> </b>""Energy,"" more than any other song on this album, has killer beats and a strong sense of identity. Drake is one of the only rappers who can create rhymes like, ""I got bitches asking me about the code for the wifi/so they can talk about their timelines."" It's a funny line, but also one that's completely relatable (if not trill). On top of that, this might be his catchiest song since ""0 to 100.""</p> \n<p> </p> \n<h3>Sufjan Stevens, ""No Shade in the Shadow of the Cross""</h3> \n<p><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/qx1s_3CF07k"" frameborder=""0"" height=""480"" width=""853""></iframe></p> \n<p>Sufjan Stevens carved a place for himself in the singer-songwriter genre with his  sultry voice and gentle touch on acoustic guitar. His albums are historically intimate affairs that make you feel like he is singing only to you, just inches from your ear. It's no surprise that his newly released song, ""No Shade in the Shadow of the Cross,"" employs the same effect, but it's much more straight-forward than some of Steven's earlier more erudite work.<b> </b>Here is Stevens at his most raw, and his most vulnerable self. It's not every day you hear an artist recording a song with air conditioner noise in the background to make it feel realistic.</p> \n<p> </p> \n<h3>Hot Chip, ""Huarache Lights""</h3> \n<p><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/9S0ONyRctyE"" frameborder=""0"" height=""480"" width=""853""></iframe></p> \n<p>""Huarache Lights"" is the first single off of Hot Chip's sixth studio album, and it's a more mature song than they've ever produced. Hot chip built its fandom with emotionally-intelligent and loneliness-inducing electronic beats. On ""Huarache Lights,"" Alexis Taylor and Joe Goddard overlay their voice to create a pulsing, mid-tempo song that fluctuates between smooth, calming verses and amplified, overwhelming choruses.

On Valentine's Day, the Compton-bred rapper dropped ""The Blacker the Berry"" without warning onto Soundcloud. The song is based around a thumping drum and a couple of layered symphonic sounds, but the power lies in the lyrics. ""You hate me don’t you? I know you hate me as much as you hate yourself,"" he raps."" Here, Lamar completely departs from the positive thumbs-up anthem of ""i,"" to create a song that hits you as hard as the angles that he spins on his cadence.</p> \n<p> </p> \n<h3>Mathaverskan, ""Witness""</h3> \n<p><iframe src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/188147656&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" height=""166"" width=""100%""></iframe></p> \n<p>Heavy drum beats kick off Mathaverskan's new song, ""Witness"" with as much energy as the band shows onstage.

This is a song with power and a true hook. ""Witness your fall,"" Milner belts out as her voice lulls you into a trance.</p> \n<p> </p> \n<h3>Elle King, ""America's Sweetheart""</h3> \n<p><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/5Ey-UCq6O7k"" frameborder=""0"" height=""480"" width=""853""></iframe></p> \n<p>""What do you want from me,"" Elle King croons on her new song, ""So beat the drum with me, I'm not America's sweetheart.""  Elle King's got a voice that's the deep South's version of Amy Winehouse: she's raspy, she's soulful, and she's got a healthy dose of twang. The 25 year-old's second album, <i>Love Stuff</i> dropped February 13, and she seems to have really found her musical personality. ""America's sweetheart"" is a bad-girl misandrist anthem that's angry, smart, and could easily be a summer sleeper-hit.</p> \n<p> </p> \n<h3>Unknown Mortal Orchestra, ""Multi-Love""</h3> \n<p><iframe src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/189137400&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" height=""166"" width=""100%""></iframe></p> \n<p>""Multi-Love"" tells a well known rock and roll story with distorted keyboard sounds and Ruban Nielson's melodic voice.<b> </b>It's about love told through the lens of a rock star trashing a hotel room.

And if history holds, the premiere will continue to grow the series' audience, </span><span> </span><span>feature more drag queens, </span><span>and once again leave pop culture fiends with catchphrases we won't be able quit.</span></p> \n<p dir=""ltr""><span>Despite the series' growing popularity, there are still many people who are unfamiliar with RuPaul, her queens, and nuances ... like the art of throwing shade. Let's get you caught up with one of TV's best reality shows.</span></p> \n<h3><span>Who is RuPaul?  Is there any relation to Rand or Ron?</span></h3> \n<p dir=""ltr""><span></span></p> \n<p dir=""ltr""><span>To this date there hasn't been any confirmation or compelling evidence to suggest RuPaul is related to the Paul politicians. </span></p> \n<p dir=""ltr"">Instead, RuPaul is a drag queen, model, actress recording artist, celebrity, and —</p> \n<h3><span>Hold it right there. What's a drag queen?</span></h3> \n<p dir=""ltr""><span>Drag can obviously mean something being pulled, or something that's a chore (e.g. emptying the dishwasher is a ""drag""). </span></p> \n<p dir=""ltr""><span>But ""drag"" has also been adopted as a term used to refer to men or women who wear clothing that's thought to correspond with the opposite gender — some say drag is a shortening of the term ""</span><span>dr</span><span>essed </span><span>a</span><span>s a </span><span>g</span><span>irl"", or that it came from </span><a href=""http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&amp;search=drag&amp;searchmode=none"">theater-speak for men who, while wearing women's costumes, had skirts that used to drag on the floor.</a><span> There's even a </span><span><a href=""http://bookwilde.org/2013/09/12/authors-and-artists-in-drag/"">theory that the word came from Yiddish.</a></span></p> \n<p dir=""ltr""><span>And drag queen — possibly because of the way queen has been used to identify gay people or drag's roots in theater — became the term for men who, for entertainment, artistic, or cultural purposes dress up in women's clothing. Women dressing up in men's clothing can be called drag kings. Merriam Webster says ""drag queen"" first started </span><a href=""http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/drag%20queen""><span>popping up in the 1940s</span></a><span>. </span></p> \n<p dir=""ltr""><span>While there are people of all sexualities, shapes and sizes who do drag, drag queen mostly refers to gay men who dress up as women to entertain.</span></p> \n<h3><span>How is that fun?</span></h3> \n<p dir=""ltr"">Well, just check out <i>RuPaul's Drag Race</i>. The show can be wickedly funny, and even touching at times.</p> \n<p dir=""ltr"">""We're dealing with people who have been shunned by society and have made a life regardless of what anyone else thinks of them have decided,"" RuPaul told <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/feb/24/rupaul-drag-race-lgbt-impact-pop-culture-tv"" target=""_blank"">The Guardian</a> in 2014. ""[The show] shows the tenacity of the human spirit, which each of us watching relates to. And we root for them. I think that's what's so captivating about it, seeing how these beautiful creatures have managed to prevail.""</p> \n<p dir=""ltr""><i>Drag Race</i> isn't the first time that drag culture has found mainstream success. Movies like <i>Hairspray</i> (twice, with the <a href=""http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=hairspray07.htm""><span>2007 version reeling in $118 million</span></a>), cult hit<i> Priscilla Queen of the Desert, </i>and <i>The Birdcage</i> (<a href=""http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=birdcage.htm""><span>$124 million</span></a>) all became hits. And Broadway producers adapted <i>Hairspray</i> and <i>Kinky Boots</i> into successful musicals. There are also a number of drag queens performing as club promoters, <a href=""http://www.ladybunny.net/loader_flash.html""><span>DJs</span></a>, <a href=""http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=drag%20queen%20bingo""><span>bingo hosts</span></a>, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jh_eBZ71hf0""><span>celebrity impersonators</span></a>, or even stand-up comics.</p> \n<h3><span>What pronouns do you use when referring to a drag queen?</span></h3> \n<p dir=""ltr""><span>That is tricky. RuPaul has, on the record said that she doesn't care what pronoun you use. ""You can call me he. You can call me she. You can call me Regis and Kathie Lee; I don't care! Just as long as you call me, </span><span>Regis and Kathie,"" </span><span></span><a href=""https://twitter.com/LogoTV/status/343511683907584000""><span>RuPaul writes in her biography.</span></a><span> </span></p> \n<p dir=""ltr"">On the show, the men refer to their drag personas the way actors refer to the characters they play, so it is common for the performer to refer to himself as a he, but the persona as a she. Perhaps making matters even more confusing, RuPaul refers to the men by their drag names, even when out of drag. When in doubt, it's best to ask the drag queen which term they prefer.</p> \n<h3>Are drag queens transgender?</h3> \n<p dir=""ltr"">Not generally, no, though some drag queens — including some on the show — have later come out and <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/4/22/5639386/why-trans-people-arent-big-fans-of-rupaul-right-now"" target=""_blank"">identify as women</a>.</p> \n<p dir=""ltr"">The most important thing to remember is that ""drag queen"" or ""drag king"" isn't interchangeable with transgender. Drag is primarily meant for entertaining an audience. That is very different from someone who identifies as a gender other than what they were assigned at birth.</p> \n<p dir=""ltr"">In fact, <i>RuPaul's Drag Race</i> came under fire from trans people and transgender rights activists in 2014 for <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/4/22/5639386/why-trans-people-arent-big-fans-of-rupaul-right-now"" target=""_blank"">allegedly</a> being transphobic. The show had a segment called ""Female or She-Male"" in which contestants were shown a zoomed-in body part and were made to guess whether it belonged to a drag queen or a real woman. Trans people and activists found this problematic, and in response, the producers behind the show <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/domenick-scudera/reclaiming-the-gay-fword_b_1092157.html"">edited</a> out the segment.</p> \n<h3>\n<span>So is the show</span><span> a race of drag queens?  Like NASCAR? </span>\n</h3> \n<p dir=""ltr""><span>As awesome as that would be, that's not quite it. There are, however, actual races that feature drag queens, like </span><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/pages/17th-Street-High-Heel-Race/293167114030193""><span>Washington D.C.'s 17th Street High Heel Race</span></a><span>. Many people would agree watching aggressive drag queens race each other is enjoyable.</span></p> \n<p dir=""ltr""><i>RPDR</i>, which began in 2009, is a reality competition where drag queens from all around the country (and Puerto Rico) compete to become America's next drag superstar. RuPaul hosts and serves as one of the judges alongside Michelle Visage, a co-host on her original show, and Santino Rice, a former finalist from <i>Project Runway</i>.</p> \n<h3>\n<span>So, it's like </span><span><i>Survivor</i></span><span>? </span>\n</h3> \n<p dir=""ltr""><span>Well, it's more like </span><span><i>Survivor</i></span><span> than it's like NASCAR. The queens go through various tests, like costume design, standup comedy, and acting. For example, every season has an episode  where the queens show off their celebrity impersonations:</span></p> \n<p><iframe width=""420"" height=""315"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/0ryuRXTogEc"" frameborder=""0""></iframe></p> \n<p dir=""ltr""><span>RuPaul herself says she's looking for the queen with the most charisma, uniqueness, nerve, and talent. (If you turn that into an acronym, that gets filthy. Yes, it's on purpose.) There have been six winners — BeBe Zahara Benet, Tyra Sanchez, Raja, Sharon Needles, Jinkx Monsoon and Bianca Del Rio so far.</span></p> \n<p dir=""ltr""><span>Each week the bottom two queens are made to ""lip-sync for their lives.""</span></p> \n<h3><span>Oh my god.  They kill the drag queens? </span></h3> \n<p dir=""ltr"">No, no. That's just an expression. No drag queens have ever been harmed during <i>RPDR</i><i> </i>... though there was that one time Mimi Imfurst picked up India Ferrah.</p> \n<p><iframe frameborder=""0"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/VMZRObp-MHs"" height=""315"" width=""560""></iframe></p> \n<p dir=""ltr"">But this isn't the <i>Hunger Games</i> or the end of the world. However, there <i>is </i>heartbreak. The drag queen that performs the lesser lip-sync is told to ""sashay away.""</p> \n<h3><span>""Sashay away"" sounds familiar. </span></h3> \n<p dir=""ltr""><span>It's from </span><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vw9LOrHU8JI"" target=""_blank"">RuPaul's song ""Supermodel""</a><span> and is one of the catchphrases of the show. So there’s a chance that might be where you picked it up</span></p> \n<h3><span>How popular is the show?</span></h3> \n<p dir=""ltr"">In the grand scheme of television, <i>RPDR</i> pales in comparison to anything you'd see on network television. But it's been growing every year. The <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2013/01/29/season-debut-of-rupauls-drag-race-scores-as-the-highest-rated-premiere-in-logos-network-history/167327/"">fifth season</a>'s premiere and its after show, <i><span>Untucked: RuPaul</span><span>'s Drag Race</span></i>, garnered over 1.3 million viewers and was the highest rated premiere in Logo's history.  And this season, the show's seventh, was <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2014/02/17/rupauls-drag-race-renewed-for-season-7-by-logo/237719/"">greenlit</a> before the show's sixth season even aired last year.

Listen to what gets lost when an MP3 is made,http://www.vox.com/2015/3/4/8147377/mp3-compressed-ghosts,"To make a file size smaller, something has to be filtered out.","<p>The MP3, the file type of most songs you listen to on a computer, is compressed. Part of the reason people love vinyl records so much (even though they <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/4/19/5626058/vinyls-great-but-its-not-better-than-cds"" target=""_blank"">don't necessarily sound ""better""</a> than digital formats), is that they are closer in format to the way you would actually hear a song if you were standing in the room with Rihanna instead of listening to ""FourFiveSeconds"" on your phone.</p> \n<p>Compression happened because (especially in the 1990s when this change was happening) file size needed to be small enough to live on your computer in mass quantities without slowing it down. Now, many computers have the space for higher-quality formats, but the MP3 format has become an industry standard. And information is lost as songs are converted to MP3 format.</p> \n<p>The very first song to become an MP3 was Suzanne Vega's ""Tom's Diner."" A German engineer played the song over and over again as he tried to squeeze the song into a smaller size without changing its sound too much. Here's ""Tom's Diner"" in its MP3 format.</p> \n<p><iframe frameborder=""0"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/-26hsZqwveA"" height=""480"" width=""640""></iframe></p> \n<p>The MP3 format can reduce the file size of a song as much as 10-fold, but in the process something has to be filtered out. Which sounds get filtered out of a song to make the file smaller was determined in 1993 by a group of European sound engineers who using songs like Tracy Chapman's ""Fast Car,"" and Vega's ""Tom's Diner."" In 1994, MP3s became a public format and, after the advent and widespread use of the internet, they are now the primary format that most people listen to music in.</p> \n<p>But what happened to those filtered out sounds?</p> \n<p>Ryan MaGuire, a a Ph.D. student in Composition and Computer Technologies at the University of Virginia Center for Computer Music, created a project called ""moDernisT"" to find out. McGuire's project pulls out those missing sounds and lets them live on their own. Here is the lost material from ""Tom's Diner"" as found by MaGuire:</p> \n<p><iframe src=""https://player.vimeo.com/video/107845118"" width=""500"" height=""375"" frameborder=""0""></iframe></p> \n<p>You can hear so many unnecessarily rejected sounds. The buzzing of the small diner, in the first verse for example, and even some of Vega's softer vocal tones in verse 5.</p> \n<p>What MaGuire has proved here is that the songs we listen to every single day are not the exact master copy that the artist recorded and wanted for us to hear. Instead, they are slightly stripped versions of their art run through a set of standards created by a bunch of engineers in 1993.  For many people, that won't matter. The songs sound almost the same, but the compression of music into an MP3 format is an important question to weigh when considering artistic intent and analyzing songs that aren't exactly the original.</p> \n<p>For a heavier analysis, check out<a target=""_blank"" href=""http://theghostinthemp3.com/theghostinthemp3.html""></a><a href=""http://theghostinthemp3.com/theghostinthemp3.html"" target=""_blank""> </a><a target=""_blank"" href=""http://theghostinthemp3.com/theghostinthemp3.html"">MaGuire's personal</a><a target=""_blank"" href=""http://theghostinthemp3.com/theghostinthemp3.html""></a><a href=""http://theghostinthemp3.com/theghostinthemp3.html"" target=""_blank""> </a>findings and his <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://soundcloud.com/magwhyr"">Soundcloud account</a>.</p>",Music
This is the only song you need to listen to this weekend,http://www.vox.com/2015/3/7/8162621/courtney-barnett-depreston,Stop what you're doing right now and listen to this.,"<p><span>Stop what you're doing right now and listen to this. ""Depreston,"" by Australian rock artist Courtney Barnett, is one of the best singles of the year so far, as smart and beautiful as it is melancholic and jarring.</span></p> \n<p>Though an upbeat song, ""Depreston"" — the second single released from Barnett's upcoming debut album, <i>Sometimes I Sit and Think, and Sometimes I Just Sit — </i>features a lyrical rhythm that harks back to Jenny Lewis' voice on early Rilo Kiley tracks.</p> \n<p>The song isn't actually that new. Barnett and her band have frequently played it in concert. <span>When I saw Barnett in 2014, she played ""Depreston"" near the end of her set and immediately captivated the audience. The song stuck in my brain for months after the show, even though I remembered none of the words.</span></p> \n<p>Barnett might be the best writer of sad rock songs out there right now. Her earlier work, collected on two short EPs released in 2012 and 2013, is filled with lyrically complicated, subversive slow rock hits. Her lyrics are what make her music so interesting. They manage to combine the confessional aspects of the singer-songwriter genre with the lilting guitar patterns of indie rock.</p> \n<p>""It's kind of that constant looking and constant listening,"" she told <a href=""http://grantland.com/hollywood-prospectus/courtney-barnett-writes-all-the-best-songs/"" target=""_blank"">Stephen Hyden at Grantland</a>.

Rebel Heart is Madonna's best album in a decade,http://www.vox.com/2015/3/10/8182469/madonna-rebel-heart,Only Madonna could turn an album that leaked three months before its release date into an event.,"<p>Only Madonna could turn an album that <a href=""http://www.avclub.com/article/madonnas-new-album-leaks-online-so-she-releases-tr-213277"">leaked three months</a> before its release date into an event. <em>Rebel Heart</em>, her 13th studio album, is mired in the controversy of that leak, as well as her somewhat absurd declarations of famous Americans as ""rebel hearts."" But the album is exactly the return Madonna needed as an artist.</p> \n<p><!--  ########  BEGIN SNIPPET  ########  --></p> \n<div class=""chorus-snippet ratingbox"">\n<!-- add number from 1 to 5 where the 3 is --> \n<div class=""rating-container""> \n<p>Rating</p> \n<hr> \n<span class=""rating-number"">3.5</span>\n</div> \n</div> \n<p>Madonna, of course, is one of the most recognizable stars in popular culture. As a 1980s pop starlet, she made her fame off palpable synths, a heated sexual presence, and drama that followed her around the world. She is the queen of pop, and as such, she's always been much more than her music — a dancer, an idol, a headline.</p> \n<p><em>Rebel Heart</em> reminds listeners that every ounce of her fame grew from her ability to produce hit after hit after hit:</p> \n<h3>\n<em>Rebel Heart</em> is the best album she's made in a decade</h3> \n<p>Madonna is pretty prolific for a pop star. Since her rise to fame, she hasn't gone more than three years without a new album. Instead of taking breaks or snagging a Vegas residency, she's been in the studio and on the road consistently for 30 years, which is a pretty amazing feat. It's unsurprising, then, that some of those 13 studio albums really weren't great.</p> \n<p>Madonna's heyday, as evidenced by a couple of amazing collections, was somewhere from her 1984 release of <em>Like a Virgin </em>to the 1990 production of the <em>Immaculate Collection</em>, which is to date one of the best albums of her career. During that time period, she was an international superstar who performed on a bed once, and always<em> </em>oozed sex. Madonna for half a decade was the only name in pop music that really mattered, and she completely changed the game. Before her, most mega solo acts were men. After her, they've almost all been women.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""center"">Madonna for half a decade was the only name in pop music that really mattered</q></p> \n<p>Madonna's second heyday was a short, two-album period from 1998 to 2000, when she released both <em>Ray of Light</em> and <em>Music</em>. Since then, she had one good album, 2005's <em>Confessions on a Dance Floor,</em> followed by a decade of albums that were decent but not memorable. On <em>Rebel Heart,</em> Madonna has made an album that couldn't possibly be categorized as a desperate attempt to stay relevant — as her last EDM-inspired album <em>MDNA </em>was — because it's an album about Madonna the person instead of Madonna the idol. That personal touch is what makes <em>Rebel Heart</em> a good album and an enjoyable listen top to bottom, even when it gets caught up in itself.</p> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""3489008"" alt=""madonna 1984"" src=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3489008/madonna_1984.0.jpg""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Madonna performs ""Like a Virgin"" at the VMAs in 1984. (Frank Micelotta/Getty)</p> \n<h3>Madonna has stopped lying to herself.</h3> \n<p>At 56 years old and 12 albums into what has been a star-studded career, Madonna is no longer a young pop star trying to find her place in a messy musical industry. She doesn't need to experiment with new synths and try to adjust her vocal style. Her sound is distinctive, and, really, the synths and pop beats that made her a superstar in the '80s have never gone out of style.</p> \n<p>There was no need for her to pretend to be younger or fresher, but she did. On her two most recent albums, 2008's <em>Hard Candy</em> and 2012's <em>MDNA</em>, Madonna didn't sound like an important voice in pop music — she sounded like everyone else. Her beats were similar to Kesha, Gaga and Katy Perry. In that mimicry, she lost herself.</p> \n<p>But on <em>Rebel Heart</em>, despite its absurd number of collaborators, such as Nicki Minaj, Kanye West, Diplo, and Avicii, <strong></strong>Madonna returns to familiarity — songs about love and religion laden with heavy synthesizers and great dance beats. It's not a perfect album, but at least it sounds like her.</p> \n<p>Take a song like, ""Holy Water,"" which features a militaristic clapping pattern and alien synth spreads. It's a leap for Madonna, but not a huge one. The rhythm of her lyrics is no different from what we heard on <em>Celebration</em>. Thematically, it takes the heretical, religious commentary and sexualizes it until it's almost unrecognizable. If that's not Madonna, nothing is. And with a callback to ""Vogue"" in the bridge, she reminds her audience that though she's older and more mature, she's still the queen of pop.</p> \n<p>Madonna really has, ""outgrown my past and I've shed my skin,"" as she sings in the album's title track. Growth is painful and difficult, and <em>Rebel Heart</em> is the result of a decade of growing pains to become this artist — one with confidence and sex appeal, but also a very distinct sound.</p> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""645260"" alt=""madonna"" src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/assets/4634071/madonna.jpg""><span>Madonna performs in 2008. (Getty)</span></p> \n<h3>Where the album fails, it fails like Madonna always has</h3> \n<p>Madonna was viral before the internet existed. When she flung herself across a red velvet bed on stages all over the US in the early '90s, word of her behavior propagated endlessly. Her failure has always been a lack of discretion for where the line is. It's what made her famous, but it's also what gets her into trouble.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""center"">On this album, Madonna gives you two ways to view her: as an ""Unapologetic Bitch"" or as someone ""Living for Love""</q></p> \n<p>""Iconic,"" <i>Rebel Heart</i>'s ninth track, is the musical equivalent of Madonna losing sight of that line. It's one of the weakest songs on the album. It's too overtly sexual to work, and too musical to showcase Madonna's ability to dance. It flops on the album and has too much of a club rhythm to do well live, either. When Chance the Rapper joins in later in the song, it seems like Madonna has completely lost control. Like some of Madonna's past albums, the track just can't decide what it wants to be. There are other songs, too, that have this problem, notably ""Unapologetic Bitch"" and ""Illuminati.""</p> \n<p>What's great about <em>Rebel Heart</em> is that it doesn't shy away from those failures. Madonna knows she's overtly sexual. She knows she's lusty and at times ludicrous. In the wake of her Brit Awards performance during which a cape failed to untie and the 56-year-old performer was flung off five steps, ageism ran rampant. What Madonna does on <em>Rebel Heart</em> is remind listeners she is fully aware of how old she is by being honest about her sexuality and unabashed in her overblown claims.</p> \n<p>On this album, Madonna gives you two ways to view her: as an ""Unapologetic Bitch"" or as someone ""Living for Love."" It's that second side, the one that makes this an album about reflecting on the loves and mistakes of life, that sets her up to succeed in the future. She's not the sex-goddess, untouchable idol of 1992's <em>Erotica </em>anymore. She's a person. And that's a Madonna with plenty of room to experiment over the next decade of her career.</p> \n<p>Rebel Heart<i> is out now.

"Meet Hundred Waters, the BjÃ¶rk-inspired electronic band",http://www.vox.com/2015/3/12/8199569/hundred-waters-interview,"I sat down with the members of Hundred Waters to chat about the state of the music industry and the tour for their second album, The Moon Rang Like a Bell.","<p>To say that Hundred Waters, a four-piece Florida electro-pop band with a whole lot of soul, has matured isn't quite fair. From their first album in 2012, Hundred Waters emerged as a thoughtful group with a swirling, entrancing sound that mixes reality and fantasy.</p> \n<p>Their second album, <em>The Moon Rang Like a Bell, </em>released in 2014, escalated the emotion and power of their first while managing to feel more palatable. By that time, Hundred Waters was the first indie band to sign to<strong> </strong>Skrillex's label, OSWLA, where they began to interact more with bands like Grimes and Diplo.</p> \n<p>Onstage, these influences are evident. Lead singer Nicole Miglis capitalizes on her stage presence much like<strong> </strong>singer-songwriter Grimes does, and the technical production, from choreographed lights to careful synth introduction, far surpasses that of many bands who've been working for longer. Their sound, though obviously heavily influenced by preeminent electronic artist Björk, morphs in front of the audience from pure electronic to folk and back again.</p> \n<p>I sat down with the members of Hundred Waters — Miglis, guitarist Paul Giese, drummer Zach Tetreault, and multi-instrumentalist Trayer Tryon — to chat about the state of the music industry and the tour for their second album.</p> \n<p><strong>Kelsey McKinney: You guys have a lot going on. You're on a nationwide tour, I presume you're working on new stuff, and you have to manage interacting with your fans. How do you swing it all? </strong></p> \n<p><strong>Nicole Miglis:</strong> It doesn't seem too crazy. We're having fun with it. The social media stuff can be a lot of pressure because you need to be posting stuff, but it can also be a lot of fun. It's fun to interact with creative people we know, and I think it's a good tool for us. There are four of us, so we have four different sides of the square.</p> \n<p>We all tackle everything separately, just like how right now someone can talk to you and Zach can put on deodorant at the same time. If I were a single person trying to do all of this, I think it would be kind of crazy.</p> \n<p><strong>Zach Tetreault: </strong>We all come from Florida and we've been doing this for three years. We've played in DC a dozen times in different iterations of supporting people and then doing our own shows. It's been pretty much a nonstop series of bands. But we love it.</p> \n<p> </p> \n<p><strong>Kelsey McKinney: Have you started work on the next album? </strong></p> \n<p><strong>Nicole Miglis: </strong>It's hard to think conceptually on tour. We work on little things in little pieces, and then when we have the night off we can work on bigger things. We're always working on new songs. We haven't compiled an idea of how they're going to be grouped together yet.</p> \n<p><strong>Trayer Tryon: </strong>I really want our sound to change a lot more before this next album, but I don't wanna say how before we actually do it. At this point, we're just making a ton of new songs. We don't have much choice in what music sounds right to us. To a certain extent, you don't have a say in it.</p> \n<p><strong>Paul Giese</strong>: We don't really view what we're working on right now as a cohesive body of work. I think we're just — it's an innate gut reaction to wanting to make stuff, and when we aren't doing that we feel uneasy or uninspired. We're always creating stuff. Sometimes you don't know where it's going to fit, but you just have to get it out.</p> \n<p>The music will inherently be different because we've grown a lot more, we've learned a lot more, we've had new life experiences. That's our job as artists.</p> \n<p> </p> \n<p><strong>Kelsey McKinney: How do you get your music to your fans? Do you have feelings about the debate around streaming right now? </strong></p> \n<p><strong>Nicole Miglis: </strong>I fully support free music. I think people call it stealing right now, but I think that's going to change in the future. I can't imagine purchasing all of the albums I have in my collection and the things that have inspired me. Maybe we're just privileged and don't realize how lucky we are, but in my experience, I get everything that I listen to for free. I'm no saint, so I can't condemn anybody else.</p> \n<p>I think they grew up buying albums, and we grew up downloading them. I don't think any of us have a problem with it.</p> \n<p><strong>Trayer Tryon:</strong> We put up our first music on SoundCloud before we had a name or a record deal, and people listened to it. That's how we started playing shows, just by putting two songs on SoundCloud<span>.</span></p> \n<p>I don't really stream. I like to download things, so I just torrent albums I want to hear. I like to have them on my computer so I can listen to them without being on the internet, so I don't really stream that much. With our album, you can buy it or you can play it for free.</p> \n<p> </p> \n<p><strong>Kelsey McKinney: Do you worry about making money, though? If people are just downloading your work, how will you have money to keep touring? </strong></p> \n<p><strong>Trayer Tryon: </strong>I'm just happy anyone is into the music at all. It's amazing anyone wants to listen to it to begin with, and if they want to pay for it, that's even better. I have no qualms with anyone thinking people should pay for their work, but I don't really consider money. With touring it's different, because you have to get money to go to the next stop, but with making music it's not directly necessary.</p> \n<p> </p> \n<p><strong>Kelsey McKinney: What have you learned about yourselves as artists while on this tour?</strong></p> \n<p><strong>Zach Tetreault: </strong>Right after we put our album out, we went on a nationwide tour, and there was a lot of good energy and good people. On this tour, we feel a lot more confident, and like we know what we're all about.</p> \n<p><strong>Paul Giese: </strong>We primarily express ourselves through technological means. Most people who work in our world stare at a computer all day, and then for leisure scroll through Instagram and watch a movie. All of that can be really inspiring, but the fact that that's happening means I think people are responding to real-life experiences. And it's more important than ever that we provide experiences as modern artists.</p> \n<p><strong>Nicole Miglis: </strong>I've become more comfortable with it, and less guarded. I've been doing this for a few years, and I just care a lot less and am able to enjoy it more. <strong> </strong>I think working on music is always better than performing, but I'm learning to enjoy performing more, bringing the songs to life physically and having the resources and knowing the people to create an experience and a world for people.</p> \n<p> </p> \n<p><em>Hundred Waters' second album, </em>The Moon Rang Like a Bell,<em> can be heard on </em><a href=""https://open.spotify.com/album/5TclsFNhJ3vy0rfDrGnn8r""><em>Spotify</em></a><em> or </em><a href=""https://soundcloud.com/hundredwaters/01-show-me-love""><em>SoundCloud</em></a><em>. </em><a href=""http://www.hundred-waters.com/tour""><em>They are currently on tour. </em></a></p>",Music

His work has consistently drawn on both the history of hip-hop and its tradition of sampling. Hip-hop emerged as a form through deejays playing several turntables at once to create a varied and jerky sound over which artists could rap. Today — partially because the genre has evolved, and partially because of the complicated world of music licensing — hip-hop artists have transitioned from a heavy sampling culture to a heavy beat-making culture. </span></p> \n<p>Lamar didn't make that transition. <i>To Pimp A Butterfly </i>uses carefully chosen samples featuring a range of artists and varying tempos to create an album that sounds much, much older than a 2015 release.

"Pop music is changing, and Sylvan Esso is leading the charge",http://www.vox.com/2015/3/20/8263695/sylvan-esso-coffee,Sylvan Esso turns pop music inside out.,"<p>Sylvan Esso turns pop music inside out. The group's electronic loops complement a sound that smashes up folk and electronica, sounding like little else out there. The group's self-titled debut album, released in 2014, is a spare, lovely treat, 10 whimsical, swirling songs that are slowly garnering a passionate, growing fan base.</p> \n<p>The group's minimalism extends to its stage show, where the only flashing lights sit behind the duo. Though lead singer Amelia Meath does her share of dancing, there aren't any costume changes, backup dancers, or guitars beings switched out. This isn't a big show. The focus is on the music.</p> \n<p>Fortunately, the music can hold its own. On one side of the stage, Meath sings, harmonizing with electronic versions of herself, as on the other side of the stage her co-creator, Nick Sanborn, pushes myriad buttons and toggles to create magical, unbelievably catchy loops that stick in listeners' minds for days afterward.</p> \n<p>This is a band worth paying attention to. But it's also a band that has thought about the future of music — and just where it will fit into that future.</p> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3523108/sylvan_esso.0.jpg"" alt=""sylvan esso"" data-chorus-asset-id=""3523108""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Sylvan Esso in concert, Charlotte, North Carolina. (Jeff Hahne/Getty)</p> \n<h3>Pop music matters</h3> \n<p>Before becoming part of Sylvan Esso, Meath was a member of the folk band Mountain Man. While on tour, she met Sanborn, who was part of what she calls a ""sad electronic hip-hop band."" The two hit it off, became quick friends, and joined forces a few years later.</p> \n<p>""I always wanted to make pop music, just because it’s a really fun genre to make, and it’s a genre that’s supposed to both be catchy and have an artistic value,"" Meath told me.</p> \n<p>Indeed, <em>Sylvan Esso </em>(the album) isn't bubblegum pop. It's a mashup of everything Sanborn and Meath once were. It's synth beats and looping sounds calling back to Sanborn's electronic work. And it's also Meath's twanging voice murmuring lyrics like, ""I have a phone that beeps/lets me know I'm not alone,"" harking back to her folk work.</p> \n<p><q class=""center"" aria-hidden=""true"">""People don't actually define pop music in the way it was meant to be defined""</q></p> \n<p>Some purists might call making a pop album selling out, especially in an era when pop so utterly dominates the musical world. But Meath doesn't see pop the way many categorize it.</p> \n<p>""People don't actually define pop music in the way it was meant to be defined. When you look at the root of pop music, it's <em>popular,"" </em>Meath explains. ""The original popular music was rock 'n' roll. For some reason now, pop has a really dumbed-down definition, and I don’t think that’s true. I think it’s music that was meant to be listened to by a large group of people.""</p> \n<p>Sylvan Esso<em> </em>definitely hits that mark. At the band's Washington, DC, concert, the crowd danced and sang along to every word — just like at a typical pop concert.</p> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3523122/sylvan_esso_2.0.jpg"" alt=""sylvan esso 3"" data-chorus-asset-id=""3523122""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Sylvan Esso perform on <i>The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon</i>. (NBC/Getty)</p> \n<h3>Consumption of music is changing, but creation isn't</h3> \n<p>Meath's savvy extends to the uncertain future of her industry. She knows how many albums she's sold. And she knows how many times ""Coffee"" — the group's breakout single — has been played on Spotify (just under 15 million).</p> \n<p>""A lot of people listen to our album through Spotify. It’s cool, because they do come to shows. It also means the only song they know is 'Coffee,' because someone they have a crush on put it on a playlist for them,"" she says. ""The only thing that bums me out about it is that there’s a new kind of entitlement. I don’t think people understand that’s a pretty significant monetary sacrifice, if you think about it.""</p> \n<p>She went on to explain exactly how big of a financial hit she feels like she's taking for putting their work on Spotify. ""The album is 10 tracks long. For every 10 tracks that are being played I should be getting 10 dollars, and that’s on the iTunes cheap side of things. In reality, I think I’ve made about $10k off of all our streaming stuff.""</p> \n<p>Meath says she understands that the consequences of putting her music on streaming platforms go both ways. The band has garnered far more of a fan base than it ever expected to in a very short period of time, and part of that is due to streaming.</p> \n<p>Taking a financial hit to build that following may not be ideal, but Meath seems to think it's worth it. ""My business is to determine how I want my music to be consumed without hurting people’s feelings or agreeing to a subpar situation.""</p> \n<p>But part of her comfort comes from the fact that to her, the money and the music are separate entities. ""There are two very different things,"" she says. ""There’s the industry, and then there’s art. From what I can see, everyone’s going to keep making art.""</p> \n<p>And <em>Sylvan Esso</em> is nothing if not artful. The album works from the first song to the last. It's constructed like an old-school album, gaining momentum as it goes, every song perfectly positioned. Sylvan Esso may be proving that pop can be smart, but it's also making catchy cool again.</p> \n<p><i>You can download Sylvan Esso's debut album on </i><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/sylvan-esso/id805003218"">iTunes</a><i> or listen on </i><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://open.spotify.com/album/5Abelpx4c3FzhTOZP3ZIvS"">Spotify</a><i>. </i></p>",Music
The 7 best songs ofÂ March,http://www.vox.com/2015/3/28/8297605/best-songs-march,March sent the music world into high gear.,"<p>March sent the music world into high gear with the release of great rap albums by Kendrick Lamar and Earl Sweatshirt and heavy, emotional hits by Sufjan Stevens and Courtney Barnett.</p> \n<p>Here are the seven best songs of the month:</p> \n<h3>Kendrick Lamar, ""King Kunta""</h3> \n<p>""I got a bone to pick."" That intro line to ""King Kunta"" could be the thesis statement for Kendrick Lamar's sophomore album, <em>To Pimp a Butterfly, </em>an incredible collection of songs about the black experience and Lamar finding his way in the world. Based on Kunta Kinte, an 18th-century slave in Virginia whose life forms the basis of the book (and resultant miniseries) <em><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roots:_The_Saga_of_an_American_Family"">Roots: The Saga of an American Family</a></em> by Alex Haley, ""King Kunta"" is more than an addictive beat — though it's certainly got that, too.</p> \n<h3>Courtney Barnett, ""Depreston""</h3> \n<p><iframe width=""853"" height=""480"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/1NVOawOXxSA"" frameborder=""0""></iframe></p> \n<p>""Depreston,"" by Australian rock artist <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/3/7/8162621/courtney-barnett-depreston"">Courtney Barnett</a>, is one of the best singles of the year so far, as smart and beautiful as it is melancholic and jarring. A somber song, ""Depreston"" <em>feels</em> a lot of things — something that sets Barnett apart from many other contemporary rock writers. Read more about it <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/3/7/8162621/courtney-barnett-depreston"">here</a>.</p> \n<h3>Earl Sweatshirt, ""Grief""</h3> \n<p><iframe width=""853"" height=""480"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/tZ5Mu2gs-M8"" frameborder=""0""></iframe></p> \n<p>The first single off Earl Sweatshirt's sophomore album, <em>I Don't Like Shit, I Don't Go Outside, </em>""Grief"" carries the same weight of the angst, frustration, and panic that made Earl Sweatshirt's first album, <em>Doris, </em>such a standout. As the track goes on, it becomes more and more disjointed — pulled apart by all-consuming anger.</p> \n<h3>Lower Dens, ""Ondine""</h3> \n<p><iframe width=""853"" height=""480"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/fHaL2jwWnl4"" frameborder=""0""></iframe></p> \n<p>Baltimore dream-pop band Lower Dens has already made two albums full of soaring vocals and lingering choruses. ""Ondine"" rests solidly in that tradition. The story of a broken relationship finally falling to pieces, it has a remorse-filled center. The constant refrain of ""I will treat you better"" sticks in the mind.

Jay Z's Tidal claims to be the future of streaming. But is it?,http://www.vox.com/2015/3/30/8314869/tidal-jay-z-streaming,"Jay Z is one of the best rappers in the game, but he's also the smartest businessman in music.","<p>Jay Z is one of the best rappers in the game, but he's also the smartest entrepreneur in music. At a live event Monday evening, he announced the launch of Tidal, a new, <i>luxury</i> music-streaming service.</p> \n<p>Tidal is already live and streaming 25 million tracks and more than 75,000 music videos. It's a new name in a sector mostly dominated by two major competitors: Spotify and Rdio, and it's the first-ever artist-owned international music streaming service.</p> \n<p>With Jay Z and a slew of artists — including Coldplay, Arcade Fire, Taylor Swift, Kanye West, and Rihanna — having signed on to support the Swedish-based streaming service, Tidal might be able to shift the future of music streaming.</p> \n<p>But it has a lot of hurdles standing in its way that even Jay Z might not be able to clear.</p> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3556542/Screen_Shot_2015-03-30_at_11.59.22_AM.0.png"" alt=""screencap of tidal"" data-chorus-asset-id=""3556542""></p> \n<p class=""caption""> </p> \n<h3>Tidal is much more expensive than the competition</h3> \n<p>Tidal features two subscription tiers. There's no free tier, which Spotify has, but it does offer a free two-week trial. At $9.99 a month, the <a href=""http://tidal.com/us"">premium tier</a> gives listeners full access to the catalog in standard quality and access to high-definition music videos.</p> \n<p>The second tier, the luxurious Tidal Hi-Fi, gets audio nerds the quality they want — lossless, 16-bit Flac files (a compressed audio file that doesn't lose any of the original audio data) — for $19.99 per month. This is an intentional move on Tidal's part to make itself seem like it's catering to artists' financial interests.</p> \n<p>Recently, the music business has been swarmed with questions about whether free entry-level options like the one Spotify offers (often called ""freemium"") cost artists money.</p> \n<p>The idea behind freemium services, on the tech side, is that free music works as a kind of gateway drug to get users to pay for premium service subscriptions. On the free tier of most services, you cannot listen to songs in a specified order, and there are ads that interrupt your service. Spotify's freemium model for example, has helped it snap up 60 million users, only 15 million of whom pay for premium.</p> \n<p>Labels and artists, in general, do not like freemium models because they rake in much less money than their subscription-based counterparts do. According to the <a href=""http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/5645cf6c-ce73-11e4-900c-00144feab7de.html#axzz3VssQknx3"" target=""_blank"">Financial Times</a>, ad-supported free streaming brought US labels $295 million in the US in 2014. That's far less than the almost $800 million created by paid subscriptions.</p> \n<p>Some parties want freemium services done away with entirely. A person close to Universal Music told <a href=""http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/5645cf6c-ce73-11e4-900c-00144feab7de.html#axzz3VssQknx3"">Financial Times</a> that the label didn't want the freemium service on Spotify canceled but did want that tier to have a cap on listening time, much like <a href=""http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/pandora-ends-cap-on-mobile-listening-20130823"">what Pandora did until 2013</a> to grow revenue and encourage users to pay for a subscription. For streaming companies, though, free services mean more users, and users are how these companies attract venture capital.</p> \n<p>By choosing not to offer a free level beyond the initial trial, Tidal seems to be implying that it is a company run by and looking out for artist interests first and foremost. Whether that will work as a financial model is yet to be seen.</p> \n<h3>What makes Tidal so luxurious — and worth the money?</h3> \n<p>Tidal plans to <a href=""http://www.aspiro.com/tidal/"">provide listeners</a> with ""high fidelity sound quality, high definition music videos, and curated editorial, expertly crafted by experienced music journalists."" Run by Scandinavian company Aspiro, Tidal hopes to compete with other traditional streaming services, but it's also trying to corner the market of high-end users whose main complaint about streaming and digital music is that it is often very low-quality.</p> \n<p>On its most basic tier, Tidal doesn't sound or look all that different from Spotify. Users can create playlists, set up a song queue, and access songs directly. The only distinctive aspect at this level is the ability to access music videos. This could give artists another platform on which to debut videos, instead of having to use Vevo, the YouTube-based music video site jointly owned by Universal Music, Sony Music, Google, and Abu Dhabi Media. But there's one <em>big</em> difference from Spotify.</p> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3556522/pop_royalty.0.jpg"" alt=""pop royalty"" data-chorus-asset-id=""3556522""></p> \n<p class=""caption""> </p> \n<h3>Why Jay Z's name matters</h3> \n<p>Most music streaming companies fail because they lack enough users to offset the massive cost of an extensive music catalog. Currently, the licenses it takes to play a large amount of the popular music canon require an enormous amount of money, especially if you want to launch an interactive streaming service like Tidal.</p> \n<p>Interactive streaming services, where users can pick, song by song, what they want to listen to next, have to license music directly with the artists. Instead of paying a blanket fee under <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/11/24/7272423/taylor-swift-spotify"">the compulsory license</a> (like Pandora does), interactive streaming services have to make deals with individual artists and labels. These direct deals are what made it possible for<a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/11/24/7272423/taylor-swift-spotify""> Taylor Swift to pull out of her Spotify deal in 2014</a>. (Swift's musical catalog, with the exception of <em>1989,</em> is available on Tidal.)</p> \n<p>Licensing is why so many music-streaming startups completely fail, which is why Jay Z's name on this product matters. No other music-streaming service has an artist of Jay Z's caliber as a spokesperson. Jay Z's renown in the industry may convince artists to give this platform a shot.</p> \n<p>""There’s only one person with a bigger Rolodex than [Interscope Records founder] Jimmy Iovine, and that’s Jay Z,"" one source told the <a href=""http://nypost.com/2015/03/27/jay-zs-streamin-biz-takes-dead-aim-at-apple/"">New York Post</a>.  In 2008, Jay Z launched his own record label, RocNation. He quickly snatched up major musicians like Rihanna and Kanye West to join his venture, and then signed a contract with Sony Music. It gave him credibility as a businessman, but it also gave him a network of people who trust him.</p> \n<p>Just look at this video Tidal released Monday at noon as a teaser for the live announcement event:</p> \n<p> </p> \n<div id=""fb-root""></div> \n<p> \n<script type=""text/javascript""><!-- \n(function(d, s, id) {  var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];  if (d.getElementById(id)) return;  js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id;  js.src = ""//connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&version=v2.3"";  fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);}(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk')); \n// --></script> \n</p> \n<div class=""fb-video"" data-allowfullscreen=""true"" data-href=""https://www.facebook.com/video.php?v=1563195257265052&amp;set=vb.1469901979927714&amp;type=1""> \n<div class=""fb-xfbml-parse-ignore""> \n<blockquote cite=""https://www.facebook.com/video.php?v=1563195257265052&amp;set=vb.1469901979927714&amp;type=1"">\n<a href=""https://www.facebook.com/video.php?v=1563195257265052&amp;set=vb.1469901979927714&amp;type=1"">TIDAL | #TIDALforALL</a> \n<p>Louder than words.

The 17 best and worst Super Bowl halftime shows,http://www.vox.com/2015/1/30/7951289/super-bowl-halftime-shows,Here's a ranking of the most definitive Super Bowl performances of all time.,"<div class=""chorus-snippet center""> \n<p>This year, Coldplay will perform during halftime at the Super Bowl. <br><br>But that should come with an asterisk.

And this isn't the first time she's slinked off with the show.<br><br>She had the most iconic Super Bowl performance of all time in 2013. If there's anyone who knows how to shine on the biggest stage, it's Beyoncé.

Beyoncé took the Super Bowl halftime show and transformed it — full lights show and all — into a TV moment about her. From the opening number (""Crazy in Love"") on, her vocals, her choreography, and even the digital projections of herself are spot on. Even though she missed one mark, we refuse to believe it happened. She is, on that stage, more powerful than anyone else who has ever performed at the Super Bowl. She not only completely overshadowed the game itself and blew the electricity, but she also looked completely comfortable. She even graced Michelle Williams and Kelly Rowland with a Destiny's Child reunion.</p> \n<p> </p> \n<p>Beyoncé snags the top spot here, because there is not a single problem in this performance, hell, there's not a moment where she doesn't give every ounce of her power and ability.

In 2001, the halftime show had a little bit of music for everyone. Rock-and-roll, boy bands, pop stars, R&amp;B, and hip-hop. They were all ""coached"" by Ben Stiller beforehand on film. Everything about this set from beginning to end is absurd. The transitions between stars are strange and choppy. But it functions as kind of a tasting plate of 2001, and there's nothing about Steven Tyler finishing the last note of ""It's Gonna Be Me,"" that isn't great.

Prince's performance doesn't make any sense: he played a Foo Fighters cover. He played a Queen song. He had an epic guitar solo during ""Purple Rain."" But the unanticipated set list gave the pop star the energy he needed to carry through on a great set. No one really knew what to expect out of Prince in 2007, but he pulled out a stellar performance, complete with rock-and-roll screeches and a custom made purple guitar.

Starting with ""Beautiful Day"" and backed by the screaming of fans, U2 performed a medley of songs meant to function as a big hug for America after what had been a very rough 2001. During the rendition of ""MLK,"" the names of people who had died on September 11 scrolled behind Bono on a waving screen. By the end of the performance, faces were wet with tears, and Bono was holding his jacket open to reveal an American flag.

They stand in a single spot next to a microphone stand, strum a guitar, and croon their greatest hits. Not Bruce Springsteen. Even in 2009, decades after the height of his fame, Springsteen runs around the stage, jumping off of platforms and doing crotch-first slides into cameras. He packs all of the energy of a four-hour long set into 12 minutes of rocking chorus after chorus. He has a full choir, and incredible saxophonist Clarence Clemons (RIP) join him on stage to play his greatest hits, and it's an action-packed performance. Springsteen basically has to force himself to leave the stage he's having so much fun, and it is actually sad when he finally bows.</p> \n<p> </p> \n</div> \n<div class=""feature-photos-share-tools"">\n<a href=""javascript:void(0);"" data-social=""Twitter"" data-source=""feature-list-item"" class=""feature-photos-share-tool twitter""></a> <a href=""javascript:void(0);"" data-social=""Facebook"" data-source=""feature-list-item"" class=""feature-photos-share-tool facebook""></a>\n</div> \n</li> \n<li class=""list-5 clearfix feature-photos-list-item"" id=""list-item-5""> \n<div class=""feature-photos-youtube feature-photos-column""> \n<div class=""vox-photo-hack""> \n<div data-youtube-id=""W795W63n7mA"" class=""lazy-youtube""></div> \n</div> \n<p class=""feature-photos-caption""> </p> \n</div> \n<div class=""feature-photos-story feature-photos-column""> \n<h4>Madonna (with LMFAO, MIA, Nicki Minaj, and CeeLo) (2012)</h4> \n<p> </p> \n<p>Like much of Madonna's visual repertoire this performance is borrowed.

""Vogue"" is an undeniable, indomitable force of a song, and the visual effects — those computer generated <i>Vogue</i> magazines — are stunning. Unfortunately, the performance tends to show its age and strays into a place of awkward exercise video around the time LMFAO shows up and Madonna does some assisted push-ups (get it, she works out). And despite Nicki Minaj's best efforts, it doesn't get any better.

That minute of stillness is more exhilarating than most of the Super Bowl performances in history. His head movements get shrieks from the stadium. Michael Jackson, King of Pop, commanded a stage, and in this performance his choreography is pristine. The rendition of ""We Are the World"" is the only reason this performance is as low as it is.

Rewatching this American Cultural Event, however, makes you realize just how much this performance needed some jaw-dropping behavior to make it memorable. This moment stopped Janet Jackson's musical career and almost killed Timberlake's. It's also to blame for the dull, safe Super Bowl performances afterward (Paul McCartney), and it's one of the main reasons why MTV shifted its focus away from music.</p> \n<p> </p> \n</div> \n<div class=""feature-photos-share-tools"">\n<a href=""javascript:void(0);"" data-social=""Twitter"" data-source=""feature-list-item"" class=""feature-photos-share-tool twitter""></a> <a href=""javascript:void(0);"" data-social=""Facebook"" data-source=""feature-list-item"" class=""feature-photos-share-tool facebook""></a>\n</div> \n</li> \n<li class=""list-10 clearfix feature-photos-list-item"" id=""list-item-10""> \n<div class=""feature-photos-youtube feature-photos-column""> \n<div class=""vox-photo-hack""> \n<div data-youtube-id=""haCk5XFj1lw"" class=""lazy-youtube""></div> \n</div> \n<p class=""feature-photos-caption""> </p> \n</div> \n<div class=""feature-photos-story feature-photos-column""> \n<h4>Tom Petty (2008)</h4> \n<p> </p> \n<p>Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers opened their Super Bowl performance with ""American Girl,"" perhaps  the sappiest, most beloved song in Petty's canon. The Heartbreakers do a fair job backing him up, but what's great about Petty's performance is what's great about every single set Petty has ever done — he looks like he just woke up from a nap, but still manages to put on a show that people can sing along to and makes them feel good about themselves. The downfall of this performance is that, besides guitar switches, Petty never moves. His stage presence is entirely based on being on the stage, which makes for a great live concert, but not necessarily a great televised, live event.</p> \n<p> </p> \n</div> \n<div class=""feature-photos-share-tools"">\n<a href=""javascript:void(0);"" data-social=""Twitter"" data-source=""feature-list-item"" class=""feature-photos-share-tool twitter""></a> <a href=""javascript:void(0);"" data-social=""Facebook"" data-source=""feature-list-item"" class=""feature-photos-share-tool facebook""></a>\n</div> \n</li> \n<li class=""list-11 clearfix feature-photos-list-item"" id=""list-item-11""> \n<div class=""feature-photos-youtube feature-photos-column""> \n<div class=""vox-photo-hack""> \n<div data-youtube-id=""_G_OZnh-OKU"" class=""lazy-youtube""></div> \n</div> \n<p class=""feature-photos-caption""> </p> \n</div> \n<div class=""feature-photos-story feature-photos-column""> \n<h4>Paul McCartney (2005)</h4> \n<p> </p> \n<p>The real reason to be outraged about the Janet Jackson/Justin Timberlake incident is that this Paul McCartney snoozefest was forced upon us. What makes McCartney's 2005 performance worthy of this list (as opposed to his 2001 Super Bowl performance) is that he didn't try to do anything <i>new</i>. He came out on the stage, and gave audiences what they wanted out of him: The Hits. He sang ""A Hard's Day Night"" in a beautiful duet with Terry Bradshaw that could have pushed this performance into the top 10 if it weren't for how bored McCartney looks on stage. Super Bowl performances are supposed to be extravagant spectacles that are made for people who don't care about football.

Neither of them seemed to understand that this was not just a <i>normal</i> Who concert and that their visibility was higher than it probably ever had been before. Instead of coming out and slaying it, the Who performed a medley of greatest hits including ""Won't Get Fooled Again"" (or as many youths know it, the theme song from <i>CSI: Miami</i>). The perfectly in-sync audience singing sounds like a backing track, and the medley of hits they churned out sound better and more exciting on tape than they did live.</p> \n<p> </p> \n</div> \n<div class=""feature-photos-share-tools"">\n<a href=""javascript:void(0);"" data-social=""Twitter"" data-source=""feature-list-item"" class=""feature-photos-share-tool twitter""></a> <a href=""javascript:void(0);"" data-social=""Facebook"" data-source=""feature-list-item"" class=""feature-photos-share-tool facebook""></a>\n</div> \n</li> \n<li class=""list-13 clearfix feature-photos-list-item"" id=""list-item-13""> \n<div class=""feature-photos-youtube feature-photos-column""> \n<div class=""vox-photo-hack""> \n<div data-youtube-id=""YOlQzU6irJU"" class=""lazy-youtube""></div> \n</div> \n<p class=""feature-photos-caption""> </p> \n</div> \n<div class=""feature-photos-story feature-photos-column""> \n<h4>Boyz II Men (1998)</h4> \n<p> </p> \n<p>Boyz II Men, the '90s boy band who were more R&amp;B than pop, played the 1998 Super Bowl with a bunch of their inspirations, including Smokey Robinson and the Temptations. The show was supposed to ""celebrate 40 years of MoTown"" according to the announcer at the beginning of the show. The set opens with the Temptations in what appear to be full denim suits, and only goes downhill from there. Why the late '90s were obsessed with oldies, we can't know. What we can know is that whoever decided to run Boyz II Men out there after Martha Reeves made a terrible mistake.

Not only was John Belushi dead by the time the 1997 performance happened, but James Brown himself made an appearance and was completely overshadowed by three white men who weren't even musicians! They had just played musicians in a movie! The dead star and heavy emphasis on fake musicians understandably made the show a little weird.

To give NKOTB some credit, this was the first Super Bowl halftime show to be promoted as a real concert. Sponsored by Disney and Coca Cola, the boy band came out in full black to harmonize one of their sappiest and most boring hits. Instead of the poppy, grooving ""Step By Step,"" they sang ""This One's for the Children"" and then were interrupted by an ABC news report on the Gulf War. Despite the show's considerable shortcomings, they are really the grandfathers of the Super Bowl halftime show as we know it.</p> \n<p> </p> \n</div> \n<div class=""feature-photos-share-tools"">\n<a href=""javascript:void(0);"" data-social=""Twitter"" data-source=""feature-list-item"" class=""feature-photos-share-tool twitter""></a> <a href=""javascript:void(0);"" data-social=""Facebook"" data-source=""feature-list-item"" class=""feature-photos-share-tool facebook""></a>\n</div> \n</li> \n<li class=""list-16 clearfix feature-photos-list-item"" id=""list-item-16""> \n<div class=""feature-photos-youtube feature-photos-column""> \n<div class=""vox-photo-hack""> \n<div data-youtube-id=""zjz5H1ZrOuc"" class=""lazy-youtube""></div> \n</div> \n<p class=""feature-photos-caption""> </p> \n</div> \n<div class=""feature-photos-story feature-photos-column""> \n<h4>Black Eyed Peas (2011)</h4> \n<p> </p> \n<p>If there were videos of the marching bands who played the Super Bowl halftime show before we let pop stars do it, they would be ahead of The Black Eyed Peas' 2011 performance. Really, the Black-Eyed Peas are worse than every band that didn't make this list because we didn't have strong opinions about them. (Sorry, 2006 Rolling Stones.) But The Black Eyed Peas are really the palate cleanser you need in order to truly appreciate how great some of these Super Bowl acts are.</p> \n<p>Not only are the vocals terrible in this performance despite the backing tracks, but most of the show consists of the four members of The Black Eyed Peas standing while a horde of people in neon suits kind of dance on the field below them. And then, when you think things can't get any worse, Fergie performs ""Sweet Child of Mine"" with Slash. It's almost as uncomfortable to watch this performance as it had been to <a hreg=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hj5NPNe3jNU"">watch Christina Aguilera garble the words to the national anthem</a> that night.

Fresh Off The Boat is the first time I saw my childhood on TV. That's why it's important.,http://www.vox.com/2015/2/10/8008953/fresh-off-the-boat-abc,"When you don't see yourself reflected in pop culture, it's as if society is pretending you aren't alive. And that wreaks havoc on your pride, your confidence, and it makes you doubt your worth and unsure if you can call yourself an American.","My obsession with Zack Morris began 25 years ago. <em>Saved by the Bell</em> was the only non-animated show I'd watch on Saturday mornings, and Zack was everything I wanted to be. He had swagger. He didn't need orthodontics. He single-handedly won the beach volleyball match of a lifetime at the Malibu Sands beach club. He had his pick of girlfriends. His rivals proved supremely unworthy in the end. <div class=""chorus-snippet center""> \n<p>I was determined to be Zack Morris.</p> \n<p>Because I was 7, and perhaps because I really didn't understand the concept of race, I grew up thinking I was going to look exactly like Zack Morris eventually. My parents and siblings were virtually the only Asian people I knew in real life. Asian-American teens specifically didn't seem like they existed. And it was easier to imagine growing up and being the white kids on television than it was imagining something you had never seen before. It wasn't as if the other shows I started watching — <em>Full House</em>, <em>Step by Step</em>, <em>Beverly Hills 90210, Melrose Place</em>, <em>Models Inc.</em> — had any male characters who weren't good-looking white men either.</p> \n<p>Looking back, my parents probably should have had more control over the smut I was watching. But American television was new to them, too — it's a way we all learned about (predominantly white) American culture. And my parents, who are from the Philippines, stressed the importance of fitting in, which I'd later learn was a response to the way they were treated when they didn't.</p> \n<p>Being ""<a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/5/15/5717046/what-fresh-off-the-boat-means-to-asian-americans"">fresh off the boat</a>"" was something you didn't want to be.</p> \n<p>A year after <em>Saved by the Bell</em> premiered<em> </em>in 1989, my family and I moved from Northridge to Huntington Beach, California — where it became clear to 8-year-old me that a future of looking like Zack Morris was not in the cards. I was one of five Asian-American students in my grade at my new private school, and I was reminded of it every day. There were comments about my eyes, questions about what kind of gross food I ate, and lots of jokes about the lack of hair on my arms and legs.</p> \n<p>I didn't tell my parents, because this wasn't like the racism kids learn about. You're told racism comes at you with bluntness, steeped in bile. You're not prepared when it comes at you slyly — when it feels like you're the one who's incorrect. And when you're made to feel like that, shrinking becomes second nature.</p> \n<p><q class=""center"" aria-hidden=""true""><span>When you don't see yourself reflected in pop culture, it's as if society is pretending you aren't alive.</span></q></p> \n<p>One of the most scarring, yet completely silly, moments happened during art class. At the beginning of the year, students were given a list of school supplies, including glue sticks. When asked to produce our glue sticks in class, I found mine, still in their package, in my pencil case. The kid next to me started laughing, hooting that my mom had gotten me the kind of glue sticks you feed into a glue gun.</p> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3393748/photo__6_.0.JPG"" alt=""photo__6_.0.JPG"" data-chorus-asset-id=""3393748""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">My mom and me.</p> \n<p>""Why did she buy those for you? Can she read English?"" the kid asked.</p> \n<p>Other kids joined in. The ones with manners stared. The teacher smirked, before calling the whole thing off and making someone lend me a stick.</p> \n<p>I stared at the package of glue sticks in my hand, fumbling around with its edges. I thought about ripping the plastic, seeing if these glue sticks would still work if I scraped them on the paper vigorously enough.</p> \n<p>I didn't want my mom to be wrong. My mom is a doctor. I thought telling her would break her heart. When I finally did break down, she swept me to Target where we got Elmer's glue sticks <em>and</em> a video game.</p> \n<p>Some 20 years later, I found myself thinking about this moment after watching ABC's new comedy <em>Fresh off the Boat</em>. In one scene, a young Eddie Huang (played by Hudson Yang) is made fun of for not having Air Jordan sneakers.</p> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3393896/MV5BMTgwNTk0OTMyOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDUwNDAyNDE_._V1__SX1358_SY702_.0.jpg"" alt=""MV5BMTgwNTk0OTMyOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDUwNDAyNDE_._V1__SX1358_SY702_.0.jpg"" data-chorus-asset-id=""3393896""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Fresh off the Boat (ABC)</p> \n<p>""They were jerks, but remember this was 1995 — before the internet,"" the grown Huang, a successful chef and restauranteur, says in voiceover. ""I had to figure out a way to fit in.""</p> \n<p>The show is loosely based off of Huang's memoir of the same name, about his experience growing up in Orlando with parents who'd immigrated from Taiwan. Huang's parents, like mine and millions of others, moved to the US to give their kids a better life. His story is about that adjustment, the strange way you learn to deal with growing up and never seeing anyone like you, save for the members of your own family.</p> \n<p>The show doesn't burn with the same type of fire, stoked by anger and frustration, that Huang breathes in his memoir. Huang himself <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/1/14/7540139/huang-fresh-off-the-boat"">has written about</a> the  painful process of feeling like his life was being sanitized to feed network television audiences.</p> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3393874/fotb2.0.jpg"" alt=""fotb2.0.jpg"" data-chorus-asset-id=""3393874""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Fresh off the Boat (ABC)</p> \n<p>There are moments when you can see his point.</p> \n<p>Young Eddie is called a chink in the pilot episode — something far more shocking than anything <em>Modern Family</em>, an ABC comedy lauded for its diversity, has done — but it's dealt with in a way that leans more toward slapstick than something more serious.</p> \n<p>The scene begins during lunch, and a black student named Walter (Prophet Bolden) and Eddie are fighting for a proverbial spot at the table and to not be at the bottom of the totem pole. Walter flings the word, and you see the anger in Eddie's eyes before the scene fades to black and fast-forwards into the Huangs' meeting with the principal.</p> \n<p>You see Eddie's anger. You see his parents defend their son. But you don't really understand if anyone is disturbed or to what depth they are disturbed by this word. The fight seemed inevitable, like it could have happened if Walter said any other insult.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""center""><span>It's as if critics and casual viewers alike expect the show to be a standard-bearer, rather than ""just"" a sitcom.</span></q></p> \n<p>If this is a show about the American experience, where exactly does being called a ""chink"" fit into the American Dream? The show doesn't seem to want to find out. It's unclear whether the show's writers, led by Nahnatchka Khan, didn't want to spell out why the word ""chink"" is so ugly, or if they didn't know a way to show that Eddie and his family aren't fazed by the word, even if it retains its ugliness.</p> \n<p>Therein is Khan and the rest of the writing<strong> </strong>team's dilemma: figuring out the baseline knowledge that <em>Fresh</em>'s network audience possesses. Will audiences who have never been called a ""chink"" realize the weight of this word? And if it is spelled out plainly, would this be too patronizing to an audience that gets it?</p> \n<p>This results in moments when the show isn't quite aware of the point it's making. Asians are under-represented in pop culture in general, and this is the first broadcast network sitcom in 20 years to focus on an Asian-American family. Thus, its audience is, perhaps unfairly, expecting the series to make smart points about race, about masculinity, and about American life in a way that other shows are rarely asked to. It's as if critics and casual viewers alike expect the show to be a standard-bearer, rather than ""just"" a sitcom.</p> \n<p>""You're never on my side,"" Eddie snarls at his mom in the pilot.</p> \n<p>That's a soul-crushing thing to yell at a parent, but those words take on a different life and tone when you yell them at Asian parents whom you've been taught to respect, parents who crossed an ocean for their kids. Yet, the words are simply shrugged off with a smile in <em>Fresh </em>— same as on any sitcom where a white child and his white parents have a tiff<em>. </em>It's hard not to wonder what the show would be like with more brutal fearlessness, more serious moments.</p> \n<p>But there's still so much to like.</p> \n<p>Yang brings warmth and empathy to young Eddie Huang — something that's difficult, considering the real Huang's megawatt personality. Forrest Wheeler and Ian Chan, who play Eddie's brothers Emery and Evan, give the show an essential brightness. Randall Park, whom we last saw play Kim Jong Un in <em>The Interview</em>, is earnest and agreeable as Eddie's dad Louis.</p> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3393872/fotb.0.jpg"" alt=""fotb.0.jpg"" data-chorus-asset-id=""3393872""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Constance Wu in Fresh off the Boat (ABC)</p> \n<p>And while this is Eddie's story and memoir, the show's most incisive moments come when the focus shifts to his mother, Jessica (Constance Wu). Just as reluctant as Eddie to move to Orlando, she nevertheless puts on her game face for her family. She's shunned by the women in the show in the polite, oblique manner of white suburbia, when they won't eat her food. She has trouble assimilating, and like Eddie, she has trouble making friends.</p> \n<p>The difference is that Jessica's ethnicity and Taiwanese culture is more wrapped up in her identity, and thus more realized than with any other character on the show. Wu is graceful and savvy, even when she's delivering over-the-top lines like ""his body is rejecting white culture."" She's in command of these jokes in a way that doesn't lampoon her character. (I see elements of my mother in Wu's performance. Sub in Barbra Streisand and Dusty Springfield for Jessica's obsession with Stephen King, and we're more than halfway there.)</p> \n<p>Wu and the rest of the cast begin to hit their groove in the season's second episode. Much more confident than the pilot, it offers more room for the show to unfurl its wings.

"""Uptown Funk"" is officially 2015's song of winter",http://www.vox.com/2015/3/31/8319045/uptown-funk-winter-song,It's unbelievably unfair that we give summer so much attention when there are three whole other seasons just sitting there.,"<p>The final snow of the season is hopefully behind us. Grass is filling back in, great green patches on our lawns.</p> \n<p>Spring is coming, and before we know it the music world will be embroiled in the perennial debate over which pop song will become <em>the </em>pop song, a.k.a. the song of the summer.</p> \n<p>Every year, a single song is picked to be the <a href=""http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/513524/summer-songs-1985-present-top-10-tunes-each-summer-listen"">song of the summer</a>. Usually the champion is crowned for two reasons: it's played everywhere, and it just <em>feels</em> like summer. The song of the summer makes people feel good, and even if it's a bit tiresome to discuss at this point in music history, it's still a fun conversation about the songs we love and those we hate (ahem, ""Blurred Lines"").</p> \n<p>But it's unbelievably unfair that we give summer so much attention when there are three whole other seasons just sitting there. Summer's enemy winter doesn't get its own song. Instead, of arguing about the song of the winter, we spend the season lying in our beds eating stale Thin Mints and cowering in the grip of terrible cold.</p> \n<p>The time has come for this to change. Winter ended last week, even if Boston is <em>still </em>getting snow, and we now have complete chart data for the season.</p> \n<p>That's right. It's time to name the <em>SONG OF THE WINTER </em>for 2015.</p> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2443836/Screen_Shot_2014-11-10_at_9.11.18_AM.0.png"" alt=""blank space3"" data-chorus-asset-id=""2443836""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">The winter started out with a firm lead by Taylor Swift's ""Blank Space."" (screencap)</p> \n<h3><span>Our song of the winter must rule the charts</span></h3> \n<p>The song of the summer in 2014 was the completely ubiquitous ""Fancy,"" Iggy Azalea's duet with Charli XCX. Billboard tracked the Hot 100 charts for 14 weeks beginning on June 7 and ending just after Labor Day last year. By holding the No. 1 spot on the Billboard charts for seven of those 14 weeks, ""Fancy"" blew away its competition. Magic's ""Rude,"" the runner-up, never stood a chance.</p> \n<p><q class=""center"" aria-hidden=""true"">It's unbelievably unfair that we give summer so much attention when there are three whole other seasons just sitting there</q></p> \n<p>According to Farmer's Almanac, the first day of this year's winter was December 21, 2014, and the last day was March 19, 2015. Thus, for this experiment we looked at the Billboard Hot 100 charts from December 20 through March 21.</p> \n<p>Only seven songs made it into the top three slots during this 14-week period. They are:</p> \n<ul> \n<li>Taylor Swift's ""Blank Space""</li> \n<li>Meghan Trainor's ""All About that Bass""</li> \n<li>Hozier's ""Take Me To Church""</li> \n<li>Mark Ronson's ""Uptown Funk,"" featuring Bruno Mars</li> \n<li>Ed Sheeran's ""Thinking Out Loud""</li> \n<li>Maroon 5's ""Sugar""</li> \n<li>Ellie Goulding's ""Love Me Like You Do"" </li> \n</ul> \n<p>Of those seven songs, only two spent any time in the top spot: ""Blank Space"" and ""Uptown Funk""</p> \n<p><strong>Based on only this qualification... </strong>""Uptown Funk"" crushes the competition, surprising precisely no one who listened to the radio at any point these last few months. The swinging hit spent nine weeks in the No. 1 slot and 13 total weeks in the top three. ""Blank Space"" spent only four weeks at No. 1 and seven total weeks in the top three. Swift dominated early winter, but fell off after the new year. Meanwhile, ""Uptown Funk"" continues to hold the top spot through the week of <a href=""http://www.billboard.com/charts/hot-100"">April 4</a>.</p> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3558728/hozier_.0.jpg"" alt=""hozier in nc"" data-chorus-asset-id=""3558728""><span></span></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Andrew Hozier-Byrne performs in North Carolina. (Jeff Hahne/Getty)</p> \n<h3>The song of the winter must feel like winter</h3> \n<p>Ah, but isn't it a little weird to call a dance-happy song like ""Uptown Funk"" the song of the winter? If the song of the winter makes you dance too much, won't you slip on ice and fall? Probably!</p> \n<p>Summer songs are notorious earworms. Everything about summer is exhausting. Every single day is the same — hot, sweaty, full of sun — so we're happy to take our summer songs as repetitive as a July full of 100-degree days. We want them to be as annoying and catchy as  buzzing mosquitoes and itchy sunburns.</p> \n<p>That's what made songs like 2012's ""Call Me Maybe,"" 2013's ""Blurred Lines,"" and ""Fancy"" such perfect songs of the summer. They were catchy and fun, but after 100 listens they became so annoyingly repetitive that we couldn't help but hate them.</p> \n<p>To be fair, no song can be coined song of the summer, regardless of how summery it feels, if it doesn't chart in the top three. Thus, when determining the song of the winter, we must return to the list of seven songs from above.</p> \n<p>Let's start by throwing out songs that spent three weeks or less in the top three: ""All About that Bass,"" ""Sugar,"" and ""Love Me Like You Do."" None of these songs is particularly wintry, anyway.</p> \n<p><q class=""right"" aria-hidden=""true"">What does winter sound like?</q></p> \n<p>Finally, then, we come to the real question. What does winter sound like? Winter is a downbeat, difficult time, filled with emotion and sadness. The days are shorter and darker. Frost covers everything. It, too, is repetitive, but in a worn-out kind of way, not a grating, catchy way.</p> \n<p>""Blank Space"" can be thrown out immediately. Though it has its dark edges, it's far too upbeat and passionate for song of the winter. We'll also cross out ""Uptown Funk."" If any song feels like the warm sun, it's this one. And that's certainly not how winter feels.</p> \n<p>That leaves us with just ""Thinking Out Loud"" and ""Take Me to Church.""</p> \n<p><strong>Based on only this qualification... </strong>""Take Me to Church"" wins by a hair. ""Thinking Out Loud"" has the slow, melodic quality that seems like a sonic snowfall, but it's also just a little too happy. ""Take Me to Church"" is sad, yes, but it's also got that brilliantly dark chorus filled with enough ominous backing vocals to make you feel cold and frustrated at all the snow that isn't melting away.</p> \n<h3>The song of the winter is...</h3> \n<p>Who are we kidding? Chart dominance is chart dominance. When people think of the winter of 2015, they're going to hear Mark Ronson and Bruno Mars in their heads. No amount of <em>feeling like winter</em> is going to usurp nine weeks at number one.</p> \n<p>Hats off to ""Uptown Funk.""</p> \n<p><iframe width=""853"" height=""480"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/OPf0YbXqDm0"" frameborder=""0""></iframe></p> \n<p>Girls, hit your hallelujah!</p>",Music
Jay Z's Tidal costs too much money to be the future of music,http://www.vox.com/2015/3/31/8320891/jay-z-tidal-cost,Nothing here is changing at all.,"<p>Some of the biggest names in music took part in a press event Monday night to sign a declaration for the future of streaming.</p> \n<p>One by one, Rihanna, Jay Z, Beyoncé, Jack White, Madonna, and many other artists signified they would bond together to create <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/3/30/8314869/tidal-jay-z-streaming"">Tidal</a>, a site where users could stream music. ""Our movement is being led by a few who are inviting all to band together for a common cause, a movement to change the status quo,"" the Tidal mission statement reads.</p> \n<p>Except nothing here is changing at all. Tidal is just a more expensive version of Spotify. That's not the change streaming needs.</p> \n<h3>The ideal price for profit isn't $20 a month; it's about $6</h3> \n<p>Tidal features <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/3/30/8314869/tidal-jay-z-streaming"">two subscription tiers</a>. There's no free tier, as Spotify has, but Tidal does offer a free two-week trial. In the premium Tidal tier, users pay the same as they would for Spotify premium ($9.99 per month) and receive all of the same benefits: unlimited streaming of whatever song you want, with no ads. Tidal also has a luxury tier called ""Hifi"" that gives users high-definition audio for $20 per month.</p> \n<p>It's hard to believe that listeners will pay $20 monthly for a difference in audio quality that isn't distinguishable through the earbuds most people use to listen to music. But what's even more absurd about the $20 model is that even $9.99 is too high for extreme profits.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""center"">If Tidal really wanted to make the most money possible for its artists, it would charge somewhere around $6</q></p> \n<p>Tidal has created a product that, in theory, woos artists by promising them that no one will listen to their music without paying for it in some way. And there's some justification for this thinking. Free streaming tiers, according to the <a href=""http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/5645cf6c-ce73-11e4-900c-00144feab7de.html#axzz3VssQknx3"">Financial Times</a>, brought US labels only $295 million in the US in 2014, compared with the $800 million created by paid subscriptions. That's a significant difference.</p> \n<p>But if Tidal really wanted to make the most money possible for its artists, it would charge somewhere around $6.</p> \n<p>According to research done by <a href=""http://davidtouve.com/"">David Touve</a>, an assistant professor at the University of Virginia, the amount of money streaming services make off the subscription model could be increased significantly if subscription services cost less.</p> \n<p>The sweet spot for charging just enough to generate revenue, while still convincing lots of people to actually pay for a streaming service — as he wrote on <a href=""http://rockonomic.com/2015/01/19/wayback-machine-why-music-service-prices-are-falling-and-cant-get-back-up/"">Rockonomics</a> — was right at £3.99, or about $6 US. ""It appears (from the data) that the largest pools of music service revenue — and therefore music service royalties — could be found at dramatically lower prices,"" Touve wrote.</p> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""3560230"" alt=""rihanna Tidal"" src=""https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3560230/tidal_2.0.jpg""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Rihanna signs the Tidal bill of rights (Jamie McCarthy/Getty)</p> \n<h3>Tidal is built on the same model as Spotify. That model is deeply flawed.</h3> \n<p>Not only is Tidal charging too much money to offer almost the same exact product as Spotify, but it's also playing into a couple of problems that already haunt the music industry and cause plenty of headaches for artists.</p> \n<p>Both Tidal and Spotify are interactive streaming services that have to play by the same legal and financial rules. They aren't services like Pandora, which pay different types of licensing fees. (For more information about the distinctions in types of streaming,<a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/11/24/7272423/taylor-swift-spotify""> read on here</a>.)</p> \n<p>One of the biggest problems interactive streaming services cause for the industry at large is that they function under a veil of secrecy. Every single deal is made directly with artists and labels, and the terms of those deals aren't disclosed. Taylor Swift is on Tidal but not Spotify, probably because Tidal cut her a better deal than Spotify did. An artist without Swift's clout can't negotiate such a deal.</p> \n<p>The whole debate about <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/11/24/7272423/taylor-swift-spotify"">whether streaming is good or bad for artists</a> is what Tidal is using to make the case for its product — but as it stands, the only real difference between Spotify and Tidal is the herd of artists the latter recruited to convince listeners to switch services. So far, Tidal isn't making any industry changes at all.</p> \n<p><!-- CHORUS_VIDEO_EMBED ChorusVideo:65298 --></p>\n<p></p>",Music

Tragically, Selena was murdered in 1995 at the age of 23 by the president of her fan club<strong>. </strong></p> \n<p>During her short career, Selena released five albums (one posthumously) and won the Tejano Music Award for Best Female Vocalist nine times. Many of her singles hit number one on the Billboard Top Latin Songs chart, including ""No Me Queda Mas."" She was an absolute sensation.</p> \n<p>Though she was a Texan, and created the Tejano music most popular in South Texas near the Mexico border, Selena infused her music with a range of Latin sounds. ""A range of Latinos really connected with her,"" Deborah Paredez, author of <em>Selenidad: Selena, Latinos, and the Performance of Memory</em>, <a href=""http://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/still-missing-selena-here-are-6-reasons-why-n66031"">told NBC</a>.

Tidal's exclusive BeyoncÃ© video preludes the next round of music streaming wars,http://www.vox.com/2015/4/6/8353963/tidal-beyonce-rihanna-exclusive,Will exclusive content be the next war music has to fight?,"<p>Tidal, the new streaming service launched by Jay Z and publicized by a slew of other major artists at a press conference on March 30, dropped two exclusive hits over the weekend.</p> \n<p>The first, on Saturday, April 4, was a surprise video from Beyoncé, featuring the star wearing pigtail braids and playing a baby grand piano while singing ""Die With You,"" a song celebrating the seventh anniversary of her marriage to Jay Z. The second exclusive, launched the very next day, was Rihanna's ""American Oxygen,"" from her upcoming, as-yet-untitled new album.</p> \n<p>Both videos are enjoyable, but will they be enough to convince users to switch platforms? It might not even matter. Exclusive music might not garner Tidal a huge base of users today, but it could be the first step in the industry's transition to making almost all of its revenue from streaming.</p> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""3560222"" alt=""tidal 1"" src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3560222/tidal.0.jpg""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Madonna, Deadmau5, Kanye West, and Jay-Z stand at the Tidal premiere. (Getty)</p> \n<h3>A fight for exclusive content</h3> \n<p>Tidal currently is marketing itself via two major calling cards: high-quality audio and the promise of big-name exclusives. As I've written before, the size of the audiophile audience who will pay $20 a month for streaming is very small, though Tidal won't have much competition for those users.</p> \n<p>Where Tidal finds itself in a more competitive marketplace is exclusivity. Its service in the $9.99-per-month tier, which doesn't offer high-quality audio, is really no different from the other interactive streaming services on the market. Spotify, Rdio, Beats, and Tidal all compete for the same group of users.</p> \n<p>Jay Z has hinted there could be more to exclusivity on Tidal than simply new albums. That could be what makes the company powerful. In an interview at <a href=""http://www.thefader.com/2015/04/01/the-full-transcript-of-jay-zs-qa-at-the-clive-davis-institute-of-recorded-music"" target=""_blank"">the Clive Davis Institute of Recorded Music</a> at NYU, Jay Z and Tidal executive Vania Schlogel, discussed the future of the company:</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>""Again — there will be other things. This isn't just about music; it's also about concert ticketing. It's a holistic place where the artists will live in. You may be able to download a song for free, but you're not getting into concerts for free. There are different things that we offer. It's not just songs — we're offering value.""</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>None of these features have launched on the site yet.</p> \n<p>Exclusivity could differentiate a company Tidal from Spotify in theory, but Tidal isn't the only artist-focused streaming service. Its main competitor in this market will be Apple's Beats Music, which has <a href=""http://nypost.com/2014/12/28/beats-music-lining-up-talent-for-exclusive-releases/"">Interscope's Jimmy Iovine</a> leading a similar charge for exclusivity.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""center"">This signals something about artists' faith in listeners to purchase music</q></p> \n<p>Before the launch of Tidal, Beats seemed like the most likely player (over Spotify and Rdio) to get exclusive albums from artists like Kanye West and Nicki Minaj, who have close ties to Iovine. The service's connection with iTunes also means that if artists were to give Beats an exclusive, it might direct listeners to purchase the album on iTunes, thus making the artists a bit more money from album sales.</p> \n<p>But both Minaj and West stood on a stage last week with Jay Z and said they would be working with Tidal. Thus, their exclusives would probably end up on Tidal, not Beats. That doesn't mean the end of Beats, especially not with Apple backing the service, but it certainly signals something about artists' faith in listeners to purchase music.</p> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""3578398"" alt=""tidal 4"" src=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3578398/tidal_4.0.jpg""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Rihanna, Alicia Keys, Beyoncé, and Madonna pose after the Tidal premiere (Kevin Mazur/Getty)</p> \n<h3>Exclusivity could be the final nail in the purchasing coffin.</h3> \n<p>Tidal's roster of artists is larger and more diverse than the Beats roster, and it includes a slew of artists like Kanye West, Beyoncé, and Rihanna whose fans are known for purchasing digital albums.</p> \n<p>However, what Tidal has released so far won't convince listeners to switch from Spotify in droves. There are few artists with that degree power, though Tidal has a few on its list. If Kanye West were to release his new album exclusively on Tidal (even for a couple of weeks), for instance, that could convince a large portion of his fan base to sign up for at least a little while. If Beyoncé or Rihanna did so, they'd bring in other circles of fans.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""right"">Tidal could use its star power to convert users</q></p> \n<p>Thus, Tidal could use its star power to convert users, but it would require those artists to take a personal hit for the good of the company. Sales of full albums may be dropping drastically — according to the 2014 <a href=""http://www.nielsen.com/content/dam/corporate/us/en/public%20factsheets/Soundscan/nielsen-2014-year-end-music-report-us.pdf"">Nielsen US music report</a>, CD sales fell 14.9 percent, while digital downloads fell 9.4 percent — but selling an album is still the most lucrative way for an artist to make money. Tidal features no ready-made connection with a music sales site, like Beats does.</p> \n<p>The only artists who sell significant numbers of albums anymore are huge stars. Taylor Swift's <em>1989</em> sold millions of copies partially because she pulled her music from Spotify and made buying or pirating it listeners' only options. What's interesting about the idea of streaming exclusives is that they almost certainly would make everyone involved in the production of the album — the label, the producer, the songwriter, and the performing artist — less money in the short term. If you truly believe paid streaming subscriptions are the future of the industry, however, this may be the best way to encourage consumers to sign up for them.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""center"">Exclusive albums could be the next battleground for streaming platforms</q></p> \n<p>Giving an exclusive album to Beats makes sense because at least there's a shot at listeners going over to iTunes to buy the album. Similarly, giving an exclusive video or single to a streaming platform, like Beyoncé and Rihanna did, also makes sense, because neither of those are expected to do massive sales.</p> \n<p>But if Tidal can somehow convince a huge artist who has the ability to move product off virtual shelves to move product on Tidal instead, it could convince people who don't use streaming platforms at all to give Tidal a try. Exclusive albums could be the next battleground for streaming platforms — and Tidal is well-positioned in those fights.</p>",Music

"The summer music festival economy, explained",http://www.vox.com/2015/4/10/8381641/the-summer-music-festival-economy-explained,"This weekend, thousands of flower-crowned, shorts-wearing music fans will flock to California's desert to watch some of the best bands in the world play.","<p>This weekend, thousands of flower-crowned, shorts-wearing music fans will flock to California's desert to watch some of the best bands in the world play.</p> \n<p>Coachella, which costs roughly $400 minimum to attend, is one of the biggest summer music festivals in the nation. With its two weekends and celebrity-packed grounds, it'll kick off the summer music festival season with a bang. It will also make a huge chunk of money for the music industry.</p> \n<p>Throughout the summer, the same bands (mostly) will tour around the country, performing at festivals that resemble Coachella in almost every way — but cater to each crowd differently:<strong> </strong></p> \n<p>Bonnaroo (June 11–14 in Manchester, Tennessee)<strong> </strong>has a 40-foot waterslide this year. Lollapalooza  (July 31–August 2 in Chicago) <strong> </strong>has a kid-friendly area, and Coachella has a dozen VIP-only areas.  But music festivals haven't always been such a huge ordeal.</p> \n<h3>What is a music festival?</h3> \n<p>A music festival is a giant outdoor concert where people listen to dozens of bands in rapid succession, usually while drinking, on an annual basis. The earliest festival is Coachella, which takes place in April; festival season runs into the fall. <strong> </strong>Sometimes the festivals are based on genres, or only feature local artists. But most of the giant money-makers feature every artist from Drake to Nine Inch Nails.</p> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""3590720"" alt=""newport jazz"" src=""https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3590720/newport_jazz.0.jpg""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Dionne Warwick performs at the Newport Jazz Festival in 1968. (New York Daily News Archive/Getty)</p> \n<h3>When did music festivals start?</h3> \n<p>For decades, music festivals were stoned, nudist, and often dangerous affairs. Though many music festivals existed throughout the 1950s and earlier, the first music festival as we know it today (three days, outside, on fairgrounds with huge names) was the Monterey International Pop and Fantasy Fair in 1967. After that came the <a href=""http://spartucusjones.hubpages.com/hub/The-History-of-Music-Festivals"">Newport Pop Festival in 1968</a> followed by <a href=""http://spartucusjones.hubpages.com/hub/The-History-of-Music-Festivals"">Newport Jazz, which in 1969</a> fused together not only jazz but soul and rock. On the verge of the 1970s, Woodstock and Altamont came on the scene. Much of the nostalgia, fashion, and atmosphere that dominates music festivals today stems from those early events.</p> \n<p>""In the ’70s and ’80s, festivals were the realm of pirates and crazy people, but as time went on in the late ’90s and 2000s the rest of the corporate world has caught up and now it’s just business,"" Jon Stone, executive director of One Reel, the producer of Bumbershoot in Seattle, told <a href=""http://fortune.com/2013/07/03/how-music-festivals-make-money/"">Fortune</a>.</p> \n<p>For most of the '80s and '90s, music festivals remained passé, and were places that attracted mostly druggies and hippies.</p> \n<p>Performing for a large group of fans is a more lucrative way to tour, and until festivals became such a staple, that's exactly what big American bands did —they toured the country and performed in amphitheaters. Festivals couldn't offer them any of the cash output or fan base to be worth their time. ""When we first did Bonnaroo, the conventional wisdom was that this was <em>not</em> a good idea. We were met with some combination of horror, amusement and disbelief,"" Ashley Capps, a cofounder of Bonnaroo, told <a href=""http://www.wonderingsound.com/feature/too-many-summer-music-festivals/"">Wondering Sound</a>.</p> \n<p>But in the early 2000s, that changed.</p> \n<p>For the first time in history, people had access to infinite music all the time. Suddenly they didn't have five bands they wanted to see live—they had 50, and music festivals could fill that desire by putting 70 bands together in one weekend.</p> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""3590710"" alt=""coachella"" src=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3590710/coachella_1.0.jpg""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">2014 Coachella Valley Music And Arts Festival, weekend two, day three. (Chelsea Lauren/Getty)</p> \n<h3>What are the biggest music festivals?</h3> \n<p>The music festival season gets its first preview in March<strong> </strong>with the industry's biggest professional event, South by Southwest. But SXSW is its own animal, and has expanded to include tech and film. The real start of the summer music festival season is this weekend with Coachella, can cost almost $1,000 for VIP. Many of those VIPs, since the festival is near LA, are some of Hollywood's best partiers. The Kardashians always make an appearance, and there are many young, fun celebrities in attendance.</p> \n<p>After Coachella, there's Washington state's Sasquatch in late May. In June, New York hosts the Governor's Ball and Tennessee holds Bonnaroo. In July, Chicago starts Lollapalooza. In August, it's San Fransisco's Outside Lands. By the time Austin hosts Austin City Limits in October, the season is winding down. And that's just a few of the heavy hitters. In recent years, music festivals have popped up everywhere. Gulf Shores, Alabama, created a festival where bands perform on a stage in the water and fans can float in inner tubes to listen to their favorite bands. Live Nation alone puts on almost 20 music festivals a year, and there are <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_music_festivals"">more than 100 prominent festivals </a>happening in 2015.  North America has more <a href=""http://www.wonderingsound.com/feature/too-many-summer-music-festivals/"">800 festivals in total.</a></p> \n<h3>Are music festivals a good place to hear music?</h3> \n<p>Not at all. Music festivals are a terrible place to judge a performance. Since bands are performing outside, they often have to deal with excruciatingly hot or rainy weather. Lesser-known bands who have to play afternoon sets often have to battle blinding sun and scorching heat. Because most festivals take place in warmer seasons, sometimes bands even play through rain, mud, and sunburns in the same weekend.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""right"">Music festivals are the mixtape of concerts</q></p> \n<p>Not only are bands facing an extra element of difficulty, but the venue itself makes the consumption of their performances more difficult to enjoy. Most concert venues are set up to relay sound to listeners in the best form. They have stable speaker systems and multiple sound checks, and are in insulated venues so that sound doesn't bounce off of the walls and create a dissonance for listeners.<strong> </strong> Outside, not only does sound bounce and travel, it intermixes so that if you stand in some areas, you can hear the music playing on several stages at once. It makes you feel like you're a part of something big, but it also dilutes the sound each of those artists is creating.</p> \n<p>So music festivals are kind of the mixtape of concerts. You don't go to a music festival to hear one great performance. You go to hear 30 good ones. The benefit of a music festival (especially a good one) is that there are enough bands that you can hop around during sets and hear dozens of bands in one weekend. They are a great place to discover new voices you love. Sometimes the best set you'll see all weekend will be the one that comes on before the band you waited hours to see.</p> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""3590718"" alt=""outside lands"" src=""https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3590718/outside_lands.0.jpg""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Kanye West performs at Outside Lands. (FilmMagic/Getty)</p> \n<h3>What impact do they have on popular culture?</h3> \n<p>Music festivals, with the exception of Woodstock, don't have huge ramifications on popular culture. They don't have a political agenda or plan to change the world. They're just pure entertainment.</p> \n<p>One place where music festivals have really taken over, though, is popular fashion. As Nicola Fumo<a href=""http://www.racked.com/2015/4/8/8365147/festival-style-coachella-free-people-asos-shopbop""> wrote for Racked:</a></p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>Spence also reports a steady growth in the festival business over the seven years she's worked at ASOS. ""It’s almost like the new twentysomething’s holiday destination,"" she says. ""They save up to go to festivals. It's a massive trend and with our customer, one that's really important. In the UK, we’ve got one of our big festivals coming up, Glastonbury, and Kanye West is going to headline. It shows just how mainstream and accessible those festivals are.""</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>The amount of money made by music festivals makes it a lucrative place for other companies, including fashion brands such as Free People and ASOS,  to profit, which in turn spurs the music festival industry into greater and greater prosperity. Shopping at H&amp;M when everything on the floor is a crop top made of rope might not make you buy a ticket to Coachella or Lollapalooza, but it might make a shopper consider going to a music festival closer by.</p> \n<h3>What kind of impact do music festivals have on the industry?</h3> \n<p>Music festivals of any kind are a great financial investment for the music industry.</p> \n<p>They make millions and millions of dollars in ticket sales alone.

That's up from $17 million in 2007. And that's just on tickets. That doesn't count the ludicrous amount of money festivals can make on advertisements and sponsorships.

Though he had a handful of hits early in his career in Australia, he had trouble achieving the same success after immigrating to the US in the 1970s.</p> \n<p>Springfield first made inroads into American pop culture with a role on the hit daytime soap opera <em>General Hospital </em>(at a time when daytime soaps could still become hits). He then found success with his 1981 album <em>Working Class Dog</em>.</p> \n<p>Springfield is now best known as a musician, thanks to 17 Top 40 hits including ""Don’t Talk to Strangers,"" ""An Affair of the Heart,"" ""I've Done Everything for You,"" ""Love Somebody,"" and ""Human Touch."" But he's also starred in a movie with Meryl Streep, filmed a documentary, and written a novel called <em>Magnificent Vibration</em> and an autobiography titled <em>Late, Late at Night</em>.</p> \n<p>Springfield's biggest success, however, remains his 1981 Grammy Award–winning No. 1 smash single ""Jessie's Girl,"" a staple of any good '80s playlist. I exchanged a few quick emails with Springfield to talk about his success, the changes in the music industry, and how he feels about his biggest hit.</p> \n<p>This interview has been edited for length and clarity.</p> \n<p><strong>Kelsey McKinney:  When did you realize ""Jessie's Girl"" would be such a hit? </strong></p> \n<p>Rick Springfield: I actually didn't think ""Jessie's Girl"" would be a hit, which is why I don't pick the singles. Glad I was wrong on that one.</p> \n<p><strong>KM: Do you still enjoy listening to it and playing it live? </strong></p> \n<p>RS: It's more like a family member now, it's been around so long.

They all mean something to me, and writers write to connect with other people. I guess that's what a hit means. It means they connected with a lot of people. But wait for the new songs.</p> \n<p><strong>KM: What are you working on right now? </strong></p> \n<p>RS: In the studio, the music takes on a life of its own once the songs are written.</p> \n<p>We're recording a new record right now. It will be out around June or July, and it's a little more country-tinged. I think the last four albums have been really strong, song-wise, and this new one I think is the best one yet.</p> \n<p><strong>KM: You've been in the music industry for more than 30 years now. What has changed? </strong></p> \n<p>RS:  I've gotten older, but so has everyone else. I've actually been in the music business for 50 years, if you consider my start at 15.</p> \n<p>The business has changed dramatically but only the business side with the Internet and the collapse of record companies. But the music is still produced in the same way, in that it comes from a human being, regardless of how it's recorded and distributed.</p> \n<p><strong>KM: How has your relationship with your fans changed throughout your career?</strong></p> \n<p>RS: We've gotten older. Oh wait, I already said that.</p> \n<p>I have a better appreciation of the fans now than I used to when I started. I understand that the artist is here because of the fans and not the other way around. We hold a fan event every year at a Club Med, and the fans come down for a five-day party. It's a great time to hang and get to know each other.</p> \n<p><strong>KM: Many of your songs focus on love and loss. How much do your own relationships play into these songs?</strong></p> \n<p>RS: All my songs are biographical, and they represent the ups and downs of a continuous relationship.  There is a lot of spiritual meaning in all of my songs — a double entendre that can be taken regarding love or a spiritual path. Your call.</p> \n<p><strong>KM: How do you balance your work and your family life?</strong></p> \n<p>RS: I don't. They are one and the same. A lot of the time I work at home, and a lot of the time my family is glad to see me gone. I am lucky enough to love what I do, so it never feels like work to me.</p> \n<p><strong>KM: How do you talk to your children about your fame?</strong></p> \n<p>RS: I don't really. It's just part of our life, and they understand it like I understand it — which is not really that much. We live in a small town, so it's not really an issue here.</p> \n<p><strong>KM: What in your career do you feel the most proud of? </strong></p> \n<p>RS: That I am able to diversify in a bunch of different areas and do reasonably well in those areas. Plus writing is at my core, so I am proud of songs like ""Jessie's Girl"" that hit a common chord.</p> \n<p> </p> \n<p><em>Rick Springfield will be performing with Tad Kubler of the Hold Steady at the Lincoln Theatre in Washington, DC, on Sunday, April 19.</em><a href=""http://www.930.com/event/728463-rick-springfield-washington/""><em> Tickets are still available.</em></a></p>",Music

When he takes the stage at the Lincoln Theatre in Washington, DC, in March, wearing all denim and carrying a guitar that sparkles under the lights, he towers over the other members of his band.</p> \n<p>A keyboardist, cellist, two backup singers, a drummer, and a multi-instrumentalist on synth and bass join Hozier on stage, but there are no guitar picks taped to the tall mic stand in front of him. He refuses to brush his fluffy mane of brown hair, writes his songs based off a feeling, and doesn't let a piece of plastic come between him and his chords.</p> \n<p>He's a naturalist. He plucks the guitar strings with his fingers.</p> \n<p>He's not a natural fit for the Top 40, though. ""Take Me to Church"" is a slow song focused on homophobia, and Hozier's set is lit with electronic candles instead of pulsing strobes. He's not a pop star, but he's made a home on the charts with artists like Taylor Swift, Nicki Minaj, and Ariana Grande.</p> \n<p>In some ways, his success points the way to a best-case scenario — in which his popularity represents the future of music and the Top 40 has room for all genres and tones and talent.</p> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""3617778"" alt=""hozier 2"" src=""https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3617778/hozier_3.0.jpg""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Look at the sparkly guitar Hozier played at the Grammys this year. (Larry Busacca/Getty)</p> \n<h3>Popular but not pop</h3> \n<p>Hozier isn't a hit machine. His debut, self-titled album is solid top to bottom. In its entirety, it tells a brutal story of life and love and religion. But it doesn't sound like the albums dominating the Top 40 right now. There's not a single synthesizer present. Most of the songs are meaty, desperate, and honest about the world we live in.</p> \n<p>Instead of the pulsing beats of Nick Jonas, Hozier has a slow, rhythmic guitar. He trades chanting Bruno Mars hooks for an urgent, calling plea. Where other artists hire songwriters to build out their hits for them, Hozier wrote his in an attic. That doesn't necessarily make his way better, but it makes it different.</p> \n<p>""I think Top 40 radio is getting a bit more adventurous now, and I think a lot of that is due to guys like Sam Smith and Andrew,"" Justin Eshak, who signed Hozier to Columbia Records in the US in 2013, told me.</p> \n<p>The Top 40 has always been variable. New genres are created and rise to fame. Rock, hip-hop, pop, and jazz all at some point managed to break through and become widely popular. What's interesting about Hozier is that he joins a smaller group of artists who seem to be drawing popular music in the opposite direction of pop — toward music that's more organic, instrumental, and emotional. Like Amy Winehouse and Adele before him, Hozier stands out on a Top 40 station because he simply doesn't sound like he belongs.</p> \n<p>There always seems to be room for one or two bluesy soul singers in the Top 40. What's interesting about Hozier is that his hit, the amazingly catchy, overwhelmingly melancholy ""Take Me to Church,"" isn't even the most radio-friendly song on his album. It isn't upbeat, and it certainly isn't the love songs of Sam Smith. Hozier's love songs come with an edge.</p> \n<p>Before he played ""Someone New"" at his DC concert, he prefaced it with some context. ""This is a love song,"" he said. ""It's about love at its most empty and vacuous and futile.""</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""center"">Hozier joins a group of artists who seem to be drawing popular music in a new direction</q></p> \n<p>Yes, pop music can be about those things, but not in the way Hozier's music seems to be about them. For all the richness of his throwback sound, it feels like something new, something unclassifiable. Is he modern blues? Is he gospel? Is he the future of rock?</p> \n<p>""I think it’s hard to sum up, to be honest,"" Hozier explains. ""I think words like 'indie gospel' work, but I don’t think it’s as simple as that. It’s blues-influenced. Maybe like a Southern gothic kind of sound or something like that. It’s difficult to give it one word.""</p> \n<p>At no point was this more obvious than when, in the post-encore section of his set, Hozier and the band diverted from his catalog to play Ariana Grande's ""Problem,"" one of the truest pop songs there is. It's a song he and his band had worked on for <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nox3Oswbbk"">BBC's Live Lounge</a>, reimagining it in Hozier style.</p> \n<p>To begin, Hozier led the audience to clap to create the backing beat for what is normally a pop song but on that stage became a gospel-driven, electric-guitar-heavy anthem, with Hozier adding lines like ""If you smoke like I smoke / then you're high like every day,"" and hitting some of his highest falsettos of the night. Doing a cover like that was fun for his audience of Top 40 lovers, but it also proved just how different of an artist he is from a tiny, vocal powerhouse like Ariana Grande.</p> \n<p>""I’m still trying to figure out why people were so drawn to it,"" Hozier tells me. He's talking about ""Take Me to Church,"" but maybe what he should be questioning is why people are so drawn to him with his finger-picking and full band and dark, difficult love songs. By playing songs by blues legend<b> </b>Skip James and Ariana Grande in the same set, Hozier proves he's more than a one-hit wonder.</p> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""3617800"" alt=""hozier 2"" src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3617800/Hozier_4.0.jpg""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Here's a black-and-white photo of Hozier. (Gabriel Olsen/Getty)</p> \n<h3>Raised on the blues</h3> \n<p>Andrew Hozier-Byrne grew up in Ireland listening to his parents' records, mostly blues. His father was a blues musician, and so Hozier was brought up amid the wilds of the Irish countryside and the sounds of American music.</p> \n<p>""I was raised with a lot of blues music around, and then when I was older, I just had an affection and a connection with blues music and the music that’s associated with it — jazz and soul and gospel music,""  Hozier says. ""I always come back to blues music. It’s kind of my first love. ""</p> \n<p>At the show, he clears the stage to play James's 1931 song <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f67_CPSB4d4"">""Illinois Blues.""</a> Under a lone spotlight, the rest of the stage dark, he plucks an acoustic guitar, and it becomes obvious just how talented Hozier is. He's not just ""Take Me to Church,"" or even his best four songs. He's a man who knows his way around a guitar. As his fingers deftly move across the strings and his voice howls, he embodies the genre he loves.</p> \n<p>At this point in his career, Hozier's song list is sparse. There are 13 songs on his debut studio album, which was released in October 2014, plus a few early singles that didn't make the album. So to extend his show, he plays Skip James, and he thanks as many people as he can think of, including the guy out front selling T-shirts. And he tells stories.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""center"">He's not just ""Take Me to Church""; He's a man who knows his way around a guitar</q></p> \n<p>Before he plays ""Cherry Wine,"" he tells the story about shooting his first press pictures in an old Irish hotel that had once caught fire. Initially, he thought the building could be the backdrop for a career built on burnt-up history, but when he arrived, the place was gutted, filled with graffiti. ""Apocalypse chic,"" he describes it.</p> \n<p>Out of this one experience came a song filled with heartbreak and carefully plucked guitar strings that explains an entire abusive, complicated relationship in four short minutes.</p> \n<p>""The way that she shows me I'm hers and she's mine / open hand or closed fist would be fine / the blood is red and sweet as cherry wine,"" he sings.</p> \n<p>Throughout ""Cherry Wine,"" Hozier's voice sounds sadder, more distraught, and more exhausted than it does in the rest of the album. It's a love sonnet steeped in abuse.</p> \n<p>""More so than the sound,"" Hozier told me, ""I think people are invested in the lyrics. That’s very important to me.""</p> \n<p>From the deepest cuts on his album to the incredibly popular ""Take Me to Church,"" Hozier has written every character, every morbid scene, every desperately beautiful, lyrical line. When we talk influences, he lists many — Sam Cooke, Etta James, Aretha Franklin, Tom Waits — but he stops on Nina Simone.</p> \n<p>""When I was younger, I just had a fascination with her voice, because it was so unique, and the fiery nature of her songwriting. Just her character — she was just a real powerhouse and an uncompromising writer,"" he says.</p> \n<p>Those characteristics he admires certainly carry over to his own body of work. Though he has only released one full album, he says he's not interested in creating more hits just to have hits — he wants to create songs that matter, and move, and change people. And those songs are built of his words and his voice.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""center"">His somewhat gravelly, slightly twangy Irish vocals make all of his songs identifiably his</q></p> \n<p>Hozier shows off his vocal range on songs like ""To Be Alone,"" his voice soaring into a falsetto before immediately dropping into a tenor for the bridge. But his somewhat gravelly, slightly twangy Irish vocals make all of his songs identifiably his, despite how much they seem to vary in genre at times. Another unifying characteristic: they all sound catchy and sometimes upbeat on the surface, but are actually full of somber, melancholic themes.</p> \n<p>""I was just being as honest as possible. I was just trying to push a little bit of grace into us,"" he told me when we talked about ""Take Me to Church."" Like the rest of his songs, it's a dark story steeped in holy positivity.</p> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""3617846"" alt=""hozier 3"" src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3617846/hozier_5.0.jpg""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Hozier performs an acoustic set during a radio show. (Mat Hayward/Getty)</p> \n<h3>Attic sounds in the Top 40</h3> \n<p>Hozier was messing around when he thought of the chorus for ""Take Me to Church."" He took the germ of the idea up to the attic of his home.</p> \n<p>""I wasn't expecting success,"" he tells me, ""because it had very, very, humble beginnings."" Those humble beginnings were a barely equipped studio in his attic where he wrote, arranged, and recorded most of his debut album.</p> \n<p>Those attic vocals are still on the version of ""Take Me to Church"" that has become a radio sensation. They give the song a hallowed feel, as if it were a praise song sung in a cathedral all alone.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""right"">Having something to say is what made Hozier a hit</q></p> \n<p>""You don’t hear voices like that really often. Here you had this young guy who was mining all of these really great influences, combining blues in that tradition with Van Morrison and kind of those different sounds,"" Eshak told me. ""He was a young man who had a point of view, who had something to say. It wasn’t just the standard fare.""</p> \n<p>And having something to say is what made Hozier a hit.</p> \n<p>The video for ""Take Me to Church"" depicts a gentle love affair between two men who are followed by masked men attempting to hurt them. One of them spends much of the video trying to hide a steel case wrapped in chain link. His efforts, however, aren't successful, and the group of men capture his lover and torture him. Hozier has said in many interviews that it is meant to be a commentary on human rights and the relationship between institutional homophobia in Putin's Russia and the statements of the church.</p> \n<p><iframe src=""http://cache.vevo.com/assets/html/embed.html?video=IEVCJ1400099&amp;autoplay=0"" frameborder=""0"" height=""324"" width=""575""></iframe></p> \n<p>""The visual is so overwhelming that it’s almost difficult to listen to the song. I realized that he was an artist and not just a song,"" Eshak told me. ""I flew to Dublin the next day.""</p> \n<p>More than 41 million people have played the video since it was uploaded in the fall of 2013. The video, with all its symbolism, brutality, and beauty, put Hozier on the map in Ireland almost a year ago.</p> \n<p>After Eshak arrived in Dublin the fall of 2013, he heard Hozier play at a charity event in a massive hotel ballroom, generally a terrible place to hear a concert because of how bad the acoustics are and how uninvolved the audience can be. But Eshak was entranced. Hozier signed with Columbia after meeting to promote his music in the United States. In the spring of 2014, his song appeared on a Nashville alternative radio station, where it was an immediate sensation.</p> \n<p>When people heard the song, they wanted to know what it was — it became the most Shazamed song in Nashville. (Shazam is an app that allows users to let their phone listen to a playing song and will identify the artists and title for them.)  Typically, high-performing Shazam songs follow the Top 40. ""Take Me to Church"" was the exception, because it went the other way.</p> \n<p>""You had this story where you had an artist breaking in both Ireland and the southeastern part of the United States,"" Eshak told me.</p> \n<p>Hozier didn't promote ""Take Me to Church""; the song did the work for him. A programmer at the Nashville Top 40 radio station heard the song, saw its success on the other station, and gave it the promotion it needed to scale the charts quickly and stay there. More than 20 weeks later, ""Take Me to Church"" is still in the top 25 on the Billboard charts.</p> \n<p>But ubiquity has its cost. When Hozier played ""Take Me to Church"" live, he was at his least passionate. Yes, every member of the audience sang along, and the glowing electric candles onstage created an appropriately holy atmosphere, but Andrew Hozier-Byrne was not into it. The heart that embodied the first half of his set was lacking.</p> \n<p>Afterward, Hozier and the band walked off stage. He had played a 40-minute set and could have called it a night.</p> \n<p>But after the first three minutes of the standing ovation, it was pretty obvious he'd be coming back. He didn't return to play one or two final hits though — he came back for six full songs. ""Take Me to Church"" was a false end to his set, but it's also a false reflection of Hozier's talent. He has so much more to offer.</p>",Music

"Don't just ask whether Tidal will survive. Worry about Spotify, too.",http://www.vox.com/2015/4/23/8484165/tidal-flop-music-streaming,"The obituaries are already being written for Tidal. But if it fails, will everything?","<p>The obituaries are already being written for Tidal. <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/3/30/8314869/tidal-jay-z-streaming"">Jay Z's streaming platform </a>launched in March with a strange press conference, a list of high-profile celebrity backers, and a pretty terrible product. For $20 a month, consumers got access to higher-quality audio; for $10 a month, they could have access to a streaming service almost identical to Spotify.</p> \n<p>Less than a month later, critics are calling Tidal a failure. Gawker described it as an <a href=""http://gawker.com/tidal-atry-my-tortuous-trial-with-jay-zs-overpriced-sp-1697023467"">awful</a> user experience, a criticism with some merit. <a href=""http://www.techradar.com/us/news/audio/here-s-a-big-list-of-everything-that-s-wrong-with-tidal-1289875"">TechRadar </a>made a list of everything wrong with the platform, and its points are all valid. The <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.vulture.com/2015/04/tidal-ceo-to-be-replaced.html?mid=twitter_vulture"">CEO was replaced</a> shortly after launch and 25 employees were fired, and that's certainly concerning. Then on Tuesday <a href=""http://bgr.com/2015/04/21/tidal-vs-pandora-vs-spotify/"">BGR</a> made an absurd claim that Tidal was already dying based on the fact that it fell out of the top 20 in the Apple App Store.</p> \n<p>But if Tidal fails, it won't be solely because of its low app sales (or even its poor user experience). The company's biggest problem by far is that streaming is a fragile business in which it's incredibly difficult to succeed. The odds of failure for Tidal are high. But so are the odds of failure for Spotify or Rdio or any other of your favorite interactive streaming services.</p> \n<h3>Why it's so difficult to succeed in music streaming</h3> \n<p>Building a music-streaming service isn't like setting up any other tech company. It's true that all startup companies face legal hurdles, difficulties getting funding, and trouble finding a user base.</p> \n<p>But in the music technology sector there are a lot of additional legal hoops to jump through — because the product these companies want to provide actually belongs to someone else. Every song has separate copyrights for the written composition of the song and the performance, which means different people (often several people) have to be paid for every play of every song.</p> \n<p>And the hurdles companies like Tidal or Spotify face are especially difficult.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""right"">Their costs to pay for music are pretty much fixed</q></p> \n<p>The streaming industry is divided into two types of services — interactive and non-interactive — that follow different laws and have different challenges. Non-interactive services like Pandora have to try to predict what users want to listen to next. That's difficult. But on the plus side, because they function like AM/FM radio (users can't pick which songs to listen to in which order), they are covered legally by <a href=""http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/114"">Section 114 of the Copyright Act</a> and can pay a set statutory rate for all performers, whether it's Taylor Swift or an unknown local band. That means their costs to pay for music are pretty much fixed.</p> \n<p>Then there are interactive services like Tidal or Spotify. Here, the users choose what they play. But that also means the services have to negotiate rates directly with every single artist. If they want big artists like Taylor Swift or Rihanna, they have to spend a lot of money. In 2013, Spotify paid an estimated 70 percent of its revenue in licensing fees.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""center""> it's impossible to tell which businesses are succeeding solely based on their popularity</q></p> \n<p>""There’s a ton of value for consumers [in services like Spotify or Tidal]. But because there is no statutory license, getting an interactive service off the ground takes an average of two years, a ton of upfront cash, and probably some of your equity,"" Casey Rae, vice president for policy and education at the Future of Music Coalition, told me back in September.</p> \n<p>This is why it's hard to compare these different services just by looking at their App Store sales. The BGR piece noted that Tidal dropped out of the top 20 apps in the Apple Store, whereas Pandora and Spotify occupied the third and fourth spots. But we can't really compare Tidal (or even Spotify) to Pandora. Because these companies have such different legal playbooks, it's impossible to tell which businesses are succeeding solely based on their popularity.</p> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""2485704"" alt=""spotify"" src=""https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2485704/spotify.0.jpg""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Spotify might be in the same camp as Tidal. (Getty)</p> \n<h3>Interactive music streaming is incredibly competitive — but the audience is tiny</h3> \n<p>Not only does Tidal have to deal with higher payout rates for artists, and more legal hurdles, it's also in a much more competitive market than Pandora. Every major tech company, it seems, wants to get into interactive streaming. <a href=""http://www.spin.com/articles/apple-beats-music-electronics-deal-acquisition-billion/"">Apple purchased Beats</a> Music for $3 billion. Amazon is launching its own <a href=""http://www.spin.com/articles/amazon-music-streaming-service-announce-date/"">streaming service</a>, and Google has created one, too. On top of that, there's still Spotify and Rdio.</p> \n<p>That's a minimum of seven major names (including Tidal) all competing for the same market of listeners: those who want to choose which songs they play in which order, build playlists, and maybe gain access to some exclusive content.</p> \n<p>The biggest problem? That's actually a tiny portion of music listeners in the country. Most people don't own extensive record collections or have vast libraries full of music. Instead, they're content to listen to whatever the radio puts on. According to a <a href=""http://www.stateofthemedia.org/2013/audio-digital-drives-listener-experience/audio-by-the-numbers/"">2014 Pew Report</a> on audio listening in America, almost 92 percent of the public is still listening to AM/FM radio. That percentage hasn't changed a ton even with the invention of the internet. The next most popular services are online radio, which 39 percent of Americans listen to, and satellite radio, which 23.9 percent of Americans listen to.</p> \n<p>The Pew Report doesn't provide data for non-interactive streaming listening in the United States, but even if we take monthly active uses as a good estimate, all of the non-interactive streaming services combined wouldn't add up to Pandora's.</p> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""3634916"">\n<img src=""https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3634916/15-Pandora-Leads-Spotify-in-Active-Users.0.png""> \n<div class=""caption""> \n<p>(Data from the Pew Report 2014)</p> \n</div> \n</div> \n<p>So not only is Tidal in a marketplace with a huge legal hill to climb, it's also competing for a tiny market of users in a very tight competition.</p> \n<h3>Tidal and Spotify also have a PR problem: artists don't like them</h3> \n<p>As if the deck didn't already seem stacked against interactive streaming services, they also have a huge PR problem. Artists are outspoken about the fact that they feel underpaid for their work by Spotify and other services.</p> \n<p>Here's Jeffrey Boxer, the executive director of C3, a coalition trying to bring artists together to fight for fairness in the industry: ""So many people in music want to maintain the illusion that it’s sex, drugs, and rock 'n' roll and that everything is great,"" he told me. ""People have great albums and they’re incredible artists, and they’re filling out an Uber application because they can't make enough money to live.""</p> \n<p>It's a common story at this point. <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/1/22/7871221/aloe-blacc-streaming"">Aloe Blacc talked to me</a> in January about his struggle to get paid for the work he creates. Taylor Swift removed all of her music from Spotify in protest of how little money she made.</p> \n<p>Whether streaming actually is bad for artists is a long and complicated question that <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/11/24/7272423/taylor-swift-spotify"">I wrote about earlier this year</a>. But this perception is a huge problem for Tidal, and it's one the company didn't really help itself with. Tidal originally claimed to be a site ""for artists"" — but it only seemed to represent the stars who already make enough money to live on.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""center"">As little as they get paid for streaming, it beats consumers downloading music for free on Napster</q></p> \n<p>That said, artists are still reluctant to abandon the streaming model entirely. ""Let’s say today we all said, 'Spotify’s awful. We’re going to take all of our music down.' Where is the consumer going to go?"" Charles Caldas, the CEO of the indie-label network Merlin, told me. ""Are they going to buy it again? Or are they going to steal it again?""</p> \n<p>That's the biggest fear for artists. As little as they get paid for streaming, it beats consumers downloading music for free on Napster.

It’s not that we have to make sure they last, but I would love to see the opportunity for innovation to happen in the marketplace that is good for artists,"" Rae told me. ""That was the promise of this internet age.""</p> \n<p>All interactive streaming services are vulnerable and all have the opportunity to fail dramatically. It's not just Tidal. It's Spotify, and Rdio, and Beats and Google Play. None of these companies are more than 10 years old, and none of them have the stability to guarantee them success in a marketplace that has changed dramatically in consumption in the last 15 years, but not so dramatically legally.</p> \n<p>Back in October, when I spoke with Rae about the battle around streaming following Taylor Swift pulling her music from Spotify, he mentioned that high-quality streaming might be a service that survives. ""Curation has a lot of value. Not only is new music a huge thing, but you’re competing against the entire history of music. Like I might be interested in a really well-curated system that was subscription,"" he said.</p> \n<p>But even that's no guarantee. Tidal is trying to be a curated system with celebrity-made <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/4/6/8353963/tidal-beyonce-rihanna-exclusive"">playlists and exclusives</a>. But as it turns out, it's incredibly difficult to succeed in a market that is intensely competitive, held together by outdated legal structures and difficult royalty payment plans, and completely unstable.</p>",Music
Americana band Delta Rae have 4 vocalists and an enormous sound,http://www.vox.com/2015/4/25/8489807/delta-rae-interview,Delta Rae's sophomore album comes with a heavy dose of fear.,"<p>Delta Rae's sophomore album comes with a heavy dose of fear.</p> \n<p>After the group's smash single ""Bottom of the River"" took off in 2011, Delta Rae's pop anthems have taken on a sharper edge.</p> \n<p>""Am I always on the edge of quitting / of giving up and just forgetting,"" goes the first line on <em>After It All</em>, the band's sophomore album. Its tone questions. It lurks, sadder than anything on their debut album, <em>Carry the Fire.</em></p> \n<p>And it's all real.</p> \n<p>""I wonder if it's too subtle,"" Ian Hölljes, one member of the six-person band, told me of starting the album with a line that means more to him than its delicate presentation. The path to a second album hasn't been a smooth one for Delta Rae. When I spoke to the band members in March, they were excited — but also terrified.</p> \n<p>""We are more mature, and we are standing up and saying, 'This is who we are,'"" Eric Hölljes, Ian's brother and one of the group's main songwriters, told me. ""The dust has settled now.""</p> \n<p>A few minutes later, he backtracks, ""Some of the songs on the album no one had heard before, so I just hope people get where we're coming from."" All six members of Delta Rae wanted me to know how passionate they were about <em>After It All</em>, and how terrified that feeling made them about its reception.</p> \n<p>After all, there's no guaranteeing another big hit. And Delta Rae want to keep making them.</p> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""3638734"" alt=""Ian Delta Rae"" src=""https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3638734/ian.0.jpg""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Ian Hölljes plays the guitar at a Delta Rae concert.</p> \n<h3>Making pop music with heart</h3> \n<p>The band, named after a story told by the Hölljes siblings' mother, features four vocalists. Ian (also on guitar) and Eric (also on guitar and piano) write most of the songs and are joined on vocals by sister Brittany Hölljes. When we meet, the three, all in black, sit by each other, and continuously interrupt one another to make sure everything is covered.</p> \n<p>Delta Rae formed in 2009 with only four members — the Hölljes siblings, plus Elizabeth Hopkins, who became the group's fourth voice. The band added Mike McKee on percussion and Grant Emerson on bass in 2010. By the time ""Bottom of the River"" exploded, they were in their current form.</p> \n<p><iframe frameborder=""0"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/bimam2j2gEg"" height=""480"" width=""853""></iframe></p> \n<p>""Bottom of the River's"" haunting, orchestral quality echoes through the sound of chains clashing and drums pounding. The video, which has more than 3.5 million views on YouTube, tells the story of a witch hunt and features Brittany as its lead.</p> \n<p>""That was a time when we just couldn't breathe,"" Brittany told me. ""We were just saying yes to things, and experiences were happening, and it was great."" In less than a year, the band went from a group of friends making North Carolina folk rock to nationwide fame.</p> \n<p>""We love music on the radio, and it's a hard line to navigate between getting a big sound and keeping the soul of the music feeling real,"" Ian told me. He describes Delta Rae's music as Americana, combining all of the things he loves about music: folklore, lyrical depth, imagery, and a strong vocal quality.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""center"">Delta Rae don't want to be a single sound. they want to be a band.</q></p> \n<p>Delta Rae's success stems from how they stack those four singers. Where a vocalist like Sam Smith might record his own voice four times in the studio, then layer them on the recording, Delta Rae don't want to be a single sound. They want to be a band.</p> \n<p>""It's hard for me to name great American bands right now that are really relevant,"" Ian told me. ""Most great bands haven't had a radio hit in the last four or five years. I would like to find the kernel of American folklore and mystique that informs so much of what the UK is bringing to the table right now.""</p> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""3638738"" alt=""elizabeth"" src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3638738/elizabeth.0.jpg""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Elizabeth Hopkins belts out a solo in New York. (Adela Loconte/Getty)</p> \n<h3>The sophomore slump challenge</h3> \n<p>Like any band, Delta Rae face a familiar challenge on their second album. It needs to live up to hype, mature artistically, and try to keep fans satisfied. The sophomore slump doesn't hit every band, and Delta Rae hope to avoid it.</p> \n<p>Some members of the band have tried to take better care of themselves —Brittany is training her voice, and Grant found a stable home. ""We've all grown since the last album, musically and personally. There are some weird sounds on this album."" Mike McKee to me. ""I never went to music school, so being able to hone in this couple of years has been great.""</p> \n<p><em>After It All</em>'s cleaner production and stronger musical backing for the vocalists underline a recklessness and a restlessness that permeates every song on the album. When the chorus of ""Scared,"" the fifth song on the album, hits, it feels far bigger than any personal experience: ""When I'm scared / To be on our own / When the thrill is gone / And I'm scared."" Though this is a song about love, it's also a song meant to speak to a generation.</p> \n<p>""Our first record had some really personal, autobiographical songs,"" Brittany told me. ""I feel like with this album we're talking about bigger things and potentially more controversial things, which actually feels a little <em>more </em>vulnerable now.""</p> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""3638744"" alt=""eric"" src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3638744/eric.0.jpg""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Eric Hölljes plays piano at a concert in New York. (Adela Loconte/Getty)</p> \n<p>When the band played live at Washington, DC's 9:30 Club in April, the song's howling ending surrounded Eric's vocals, the rest of the band members turning to face him. A reverent<strong> </strong>silence moved through the crowd for a long moment.</p> \n<p>The meat of the album comes after ""Scared,"" when the songs slow down and the emotion ramps up, drawing more on folklore and fear than pop sounds. Ian told me the first version of the album was too pop, which scared the band. So the members spent time in Raleigh, North Carolina, trying to get back to what they believe makes them great.</p> \n<p>""When you get into the second album cycle, the world around you hushes yourself so you can think."" Brittany told me.</p> \n<p>And Delta Rae have thought a lot about what they want to be in the past two years. Some of the members have bought houses. Some have moved across the country. All of them say they feel more like themselves now than they did three years ago.</p> \n<p>""We still are growing up, but there's a lot more of a feeling of adventure on this album,"" Hopkins told me. Adventure might be just what Delta Rae needs.</p> \n<h3></h3>",Music
The 5 best songs of April 2015,http://www.vox.com/2015/5/2/8529513/best-songs-april-2015,"With song-of-summer debates on the horizon, artists released their slower, more full-hearted songs in April.","<p>With song-of-summer debates on the horizon, artists released their slower, more full-hearted songs in April. If <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/3/28/8297605/best-songs-march"">March</a> was a month for heavy emotional hits, April has been a month for sweetening up the pain with songs like Carly Rae Jepsen's ""All That"" and Torres's ""Cowboy Guilt.""</p> \n<p>Here are the top five songs of April:</p> \n<h3>Carly Rae Jepsen, ""All That""</h3> \n<p>Carly Rae Jepsen is as sugar-sweet as pop stars come. Her 2012 mammoth hit ""Call Me Maybe"" was such an earworm that it spawned a wave of lip-synced videos, and the first single from her upcoming third album ""I Really Like You"" hit all of the same upbeat, furiously catchy notes.</p> \n<p>""All That"" takes the rhythm<strong> </strong>of those two songs and turns the dial back a few decades to a 1980s-esque, slap bass pop ballad. It has almost the same rhythm and tone as Britney Spears's 1999 ""Sometimes,"" which is to say it's lyrically pretty weak but sonically sticky. ""Show me if you want me, if I'm all that,"" Jepsen croons in the chorus. It's not as much of an earworm as ""Call Me Maybe,"" but it shows a maturation in Jepsen's writing and tone that can't be dismissed easily.</p> \n<p><iframe width=""853"" height=""480"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/W374tWnsk70"" frameborder=""0""></iframe></p> \n<p> </p> \n<h3>U.S. Girls, ""Damn That Valley""</h3> \n<p>The first single from U.S. Girls' upcoming album <em>4D</em> is a shuffle-grooving, electro-popped grunge hit. ""Damn That Valley"" has all the wailing, echoing vocals that lead singer Meghan Remy nailed on 2012's <em>Gem</em>, but here they feel a bit more evolved, with a stronger vocal dissonance and backing electronica that really allow Remy's voice to soar higher than it has before.</p> \n<p>At just over three minutes, ""Damn That Valley"" sounds like the underground version of a Top 40 hit. ""That’s the valley that took my man from me,"" Remy screams in the chorus of a song with as much distress as hooking beats.</p> \n<p><iframe width=""853"" height=""480"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/93yOrb04Eao"" frameborder=""0""></iframe></p> \n<p> </p> \n<h3>Young Thug, ""Constantly Hating"" (featuring Birdman)</h3> \n<p>""Constantly Hating"" confronts some of the most prominent features of hip-hop and turns them on their head. Instead of hitting you with an up-front, aggressive beat, the song's bass drum feels like it's coming from another room. Rather than boasting fast-talking rap, Young Thug draws out a few melodies, keeping his vocals slower.</p> \n<p>In contrast to his earlier work, Young Thug feels more mature here. His lyrics are more precise, his beats are thicker, and the addition of Birdman's section makes this song sound like both 1999 Lil Wayne and some hip-hop movement we haven't even encountered yet.</p> \n<p><iframe width=""853"" height=""480"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/utxOjjc7WvU"" frameborder=""0""></iframe></p> \n<p> </p> \n<h3>Torres, ""Cowboy Guilt""</h3> \n<p>Torres is the artist I'm paying the most attention to in 2015. Every single she's released off her sophomore album <em>Sprinter </em>has been a giant leap in maturity and style<em>. </em>""Cowboy Guilt"" takes a sharp turn from the punk-rooted ""Strange Hellos"" and veers deeper into singer Mackenzie Scott's personal life. It starts with a thumping bass beat, then layers in a climbing electronic melody.</p> \n<p>""We spend our only season on a mattress sleeping / with our best friend / We drowned out winter livers with weary resignation,"" Scott sings mellowly, creating a kind of deep, rhythmic ballad inside the modernist sounds. Meanwhile, Scott's voice itself drowns under the beats she has created.</p> \n<p><iframe width=""100%"" height=""166"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/201955921&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false""></iframe></p> \n<h3></h3> \n<h3>Samantha Urbani, ""1 2 3 4""</h3> \n<p>Samantha Urbani, formerly of the band Friends, kicked out this funk-inspired pop hit on SoundCloud in early April. It's a song with the groove of an '80s pop hit and the spunk of a young Madonna. If Taylor Swift's <em>1989 </em>was merely inspired by '80s pop, Urbani's ""1 2 3 4"" straight up <em>is</em> '80s pop.</p> \n<p>There are glistening keyboards and light synths. There are strange disco drums and plenty of grooving beats that are perfect for the dance floor. In the middle of ""1 2 3 4,"" there's an instrumental break that sounds like you're drifting under water, only to return you to fresh air with the thumping chorus and Urbani's voice swooning. It's the '80s revival we didn't know we wanted.</p> \n<p><iframe width=""100%"" height=""166"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/199863192&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false""></iframe></p> \n<p> </p> \n<p>For more great tracks from 2015, check out our lists of <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/3/28/8297605/best-songs-march"">March songs</a>,  <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/2/28/8124219/best-songs-2015"">February songs</a>, and <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/1/31/7954105/best-songs-January"">January songs</a>. <em>Listen to all of the best songs of 2015 here:</em></p> \n<p><iframe src=""https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify:user:1270767745:playlist:0wa11g5LgqJo8Md0P4sV4E"" width=""300"" height=""380"" frameborder=""0"" allowtransparency=""true""></iframe></p>",Music
"If you want to use music, you've got to pay for it",http://www.vox.com/2015/5/11/8528839/future-of-music,"Why the music industry should be tackling three major problems: infrastructure, transparency, and technology.","<div class=""chorus-snippet center""> \n<p>Jeff Price slaps his hands on his desk. As he details the flaws he's found in the music industry since the early 2000s, his words fly out faster and faster until he has to stop to breathe in the middle of a sentence.</p> \n<p>""Music is important,"" says Price, the former owner of the indie record label Spin. ""Music has inherent value. And if you want to use music, you've got to fucking pay for it.""</p> \n<p>In 2005, Price co-founded a company called <a href=""https://www.tunecore.com/"" target=""_blank"">Tunecore</a>. At a time when the only other option for digital sales was the iTunes Store, Tunecore allowed musicians to upload their music to sell on the internet. Artists, Price believed, no longer had to get locked into contracts with labels, ones where they signed away their copyright. Price realized the internet had the potential to change the music industry's whole business model.</p> \n<q>""I think what happens in the next three years will really decide the future of the industry""</q> \n<p>""I launched Tunecore because I thought artists were being screwed, and you know what? I was right,"" he says.</p> \n<p>Tunecore became part of the revolution that overthrew the old system of music and helped introduce a new digital Wild West. It was radically successful in helping artists get their music online.</p> \n<p>Now Price is trying to do the same thing for streaming. In 2013, after being <a href=""https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20130130/12151521828/tunecore-fires-last-remaining-founder-gets-into-ridiculously-petty-fight-with-jeff-price.shtml"" target=""_blank"">ousted from Tunecore</a>, Price founded <a href=""http://www.audiam.com/about/"">Audiam</a>, a service that attempts to help artists get paid for digital streams.</p> \n<p>Price is a controversial figure in the music industry. He yells and rants, even on the phone with me. He isn't right about everything, but he's right about this: the music industry has a problem with ownership and pricing transparency, and nobody who could do anything seems to care about fixing it.</p> \n<h3>The crisis in music</h3> \n<p>Money in music comes from payment. Most people, however, don't pay for music anymore. From 2012 to 2013, purchasing physical music such as CDs and records dropped 13 percent, according to the <a href=""https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=5&amp;ved=0CDMQFjAE&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.stateofthemedia.org%2F2012%2Faudio-how-far-will-digital-go%2Faudio-by-the-numbers%2F&amp;ei=y3hCVYCZPO3asAT854HgCQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNEkcpmmdBV6UP1w-o_ZpmvyHhNQfg&amp;sig2=jY_txPjKEMN7XoAjNDQZjw&amp;bvm=bv.92189499,d.cWc"">Pew Research Center</a>. Digital music purchases dropped 6.3 percent. That year was the third in a decade and a half in which physical music sales dropped more than 5 percent. For everyone who makes their livelihood from music, those numbers are terrifying. But they're especially concerning to artists.</p> \n<p>Artists don't feel like they're getting their fair shake, as songwriter <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/1/22/7871221/aloe-blacc-streaming"">Aloe Blacc</a> told me in December. Labels, who represent performers and their copyrights, feel like they are being squeezed out of the picture and losing money rapidly. Publishers, who handle the songwriters and their copyrights, are worried that copyright is going to change so drastically that their future may be in jeopardy.</p> \n<div class=""float-right s-sidebar""> \n<h4>More on music</h4> \n<a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/11/24/7272423/taylor-swift-spotify""> <img data-chorus-asset-id=""3680074"" alt=""taylor_swift.0.0.0.jpg"" src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3680074/taylor_swift.0.0.0.jpg""></a> \n<p><a target=""new"" href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/5/11/8577937/radio-future-music"">Radio is the most stable part of the music industry, but that's not a high bar to clear</a></p> \n<p><a target=""new"" href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/11/24/7272423/taylor-swift-spotify"">Is streaming bad for artists?

This chart proves it.</a></p> \n</div> \n<p>Almost everyone in music thinks they aren't paid what they're worth. Some have numbers to prove it. In November, Blacc wrote in <a href=""http://www.wired.com/2014/11/aloe-blacc-pay-songwriters/"">Wired</a> that Avicii’s ""Wake Me Up!,"" which Blacc co-wrote and sings, was ""the most streamed song in Spotify history and the 13th most played song on Pandora since its release in 2013, with more than 168 million streams in the US."" And yet, he wrote, ""that yielded only $12,359 in Pandora domestic royalties.""</p> \n<p>The numbers are much, much fuzzier than they appear, however. One of the big problems music is facing is that everyone is dissatisfied with the amount of money they are making, but they have very little data to prove their point accurately. There's <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/11/24/7272423/taylor-swift-spotify"">no concrete data</a> that shows it's exponentially harder for an artist to make money streaming than it was to make money from selling digital or hard-copy albums.</p> \n<p>There are a few things everyone in the industry wants. Everyone wants listeners to be able to access, listen to, and enjoy music. Everyone wants, or at least says they want, creators to be paid for creating that music. But pretty much everything else is open for debate.</p> \n<p>""This is really a crucial time,"" Charles Caldas, the founder of the digital rights agency <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.merlinnetwork.org/"">the Merlin Network</a>, told me. ""I think what happens in the next three years will really decide the future of the industry.""</p> \n<p>There are three main components of the industry — infrastructure, transparency, and technology — that together could hold the key to fixing this whole mess and creating a world in which art can flourish, both creatively and financially.</p> \n<h3>The internet transformed how we listen to — and pay for — music</h3> \n<p>The music industry used to function like a record store. The store had a single entrance, and when you walked through it, the first thing you'd see was a display of Top 40 albums — the Celine Dions and Norah Joneses and Madonnas of the world. Everyone had to walk past the stuff at the front to get to their niche area, be it rock 'n' roll, hip-hop, or metal.</p> \n<p>Then the internet happened.</p> \n<p>In 2003, iTunes blew a new door into the wall of the record store, creating another way for consumers to find music. As the internet grew and Napster solidified its popularity, more and more doors were blown into the walls of the record store. Everyone could find any album they wanted at any time and didn't even have to walk past the Top 40 to get there. They didn't have to walk at all.</p> \n<p>""There used to just be a handful of ways to get into the marketplace,"" Casey Rae, a vice president at the <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.futureofmusic.org/"">Future of Music Coalition</a>, told me. ""Now there are infinite ways. The earlier system still had a lot of disadvantages, like limited shelf space and fewer chances for the non-mainstream artists to get heard.""</p> \n<p>Now, instead of an organized record store, music exists everywhere, which makes it that much harder to keep track of. Instead of knowing exactly how many records were made, packaged, and sold, music changes hands far quicker than money ever could. It can be under a pay lock in one moment and free online in another. The internet made music more accessible than ever, but it also made it much harder to trace. The malleability of music makes it a more creative field than ever before, but it also makes it one in which no one really knows who made, owns, or should get paid for anything.</p> \n<p>""We have a totally new model,"" Charles Caldas told me. ""There's a shift going on from ownership to consumption and access. It's fundamentally changing the way people pay for music.""</p> \n<p>Indeed, the idea of owning music is outdated. In terms of revenue alone, from 2013 to 2014 the <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/11/5/7154357/taylor-swift-sold-2-albums-every-second-last-week-but-thats-not-the"">sales of digital music fell </a>almost as much as sales of physical CDs did. The only two sectors of the industry that saw growth in the last year were streaming and <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/1/27/7922989/music-sales-2014"">vinyl, which is a collectors' hobby. </a></p> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""3683916"" alt=""music streaming vs sales"" src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3683916/music_streaming.0.png""></p> \n<p>Artists are being forced to adapt in response to this shift.

Right now, they cannot expect everyone to pay full price for their work. Just like young artists handed out cassette tapes during the <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.pbs.org/opb/historydetectives/investigation/birthplace-of-hip-hop/"">rise of hip-hop</a> in the Bronx, they are handing out their work to potential fans.</p> \n<q>""I fully support free music.

We’re being asked to invest in a whole new business model without getting any reward for it.""</p> \n<p>The big debate over money led <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/11/24/7272423/taylor-swift-spotify"">Taylor Swift to withdraw all of her music from Spotify</a> in December. Streaming is making artists money, but it's not enough to sustain an artist on its own — they must sign advertising deals, tour extensively, or bring in some other supplemental income to make that work. For a pop star, those things are part of the job, but for a smaller artist they can be exhausting. Only a major overhaul to the way royalties are paid out and the structures behind that process could make streaming as profitable as possible for artists.</p> \n<h3>The problem with copyright</h3> \n<p>The problem is that music royalties are based on licensing — who owns what parts of the song at what percentage, and who gets paid for what — and the current system for copyrighting music is incredibly and unnecessarily convoluted. Here's how it works right now: every song has two copyrights, a mechanical copyright for the music and lyrics and one for the actual recorded performance of the song. Every type of platform pays a flat fee for the mechanical license, but the performance licenses vary.</p> \n<p>None of these laws were passed even semi-recently. The idea for the <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/11/24/7272423/taylor-swift-spotify"">mechanical copyright</a>, in fact, stems from mechanical pianos, which were heavily used in the early 20th century.</p> \n<p>""I think everybody should be doing a lot and probably a lot more to reassess the shape of how monetization happens, to find a way that people can be, if not happy, at least in a place where they can continue to create and produce music,"" Caldas told me.</p> \n<p>Every stakeholder wants the laws around copyright to change so that they receive a bigger chunk of the pie in the end. The argument right now centers on the <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.sagaftra.org/tell-congress-support-recording-artists-and-fair-play-fair-pay-act-2015"">Fair Play Fair Pay Act</a>, a bill before Congress that's attempting to change the way artists are paid for radio plays.</p> \n<p>Currently a compulsory license is in place for radio and non-interactive streaming services where users cannot pick the next song, like Pandora. The compulsory license is enforced by the <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/2/6/7992391/copyright-office-music-report"">United States Copyright Office</a>, and what it does is make it so that artists cannot opt out of having their music played.  Instead of having to negotiate with every single songwriter for every single song, a site like Pandora can pay a single blanket fee (based on a statutory license)  to both performers and songwriters for every song and be able to play everything.</p> \n<!-- CHORUS_VIDEO_EMBED ChorusVideo:65294 --> \n<div class=""vidcaption""> \n<p class=""caption"">Like this video? <a href=""http://bit.ly/vox-video-rocks-you-should-subscribe"" target=""new"">Subscribe to Vox on YouTube.</a></p> \n</div> \n<br><br> \n<p>However, a recent report from the <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/2/6/7992391/copyright-office-music-report"">United States Copyright Office</a> is threatening to remove that license altogether. Because artists cannot opt out of radio play, they have no strength to wager for more money. Songwriters are lobbying to remove the license and make it so that each artist and songwriter would have to reach a direct deal with anyone who wanted to perform their music. This change could get artists more money, but it could also slow down the process for performance and make it more difficult for users to access songs.</p> \n<p>After the report came out, Dave Grimaldi, director of public affairs for Pandora, said in a statement, ""The current state of opacity causes real harm to artists, listeners, and the tens of thousands of American businesses that legally play music every day for millions of consumers. Thus, statutory licenses are a necessary part of the music ecosystem."" Without that statutory license, Pandora would have to directly negotiate with every single artist.</p> \n<p>Were the compulsory license revoked, major labels could pull huge swaths of their music out of companies like Pandora without any warning until a new deal was reached that made them and their artists more money.</p> \n<p>That, in theory, seems like a good thing. But it's not clear if, in practice, revoking the compulsory license would actually do much good.<strong> </strong> That's because the music industry as it stands has no catalog of the information it needs — such as who wrote, recorded, and owns what percentage of each song — to pay artists more, much less create a brand new structure for the entire industry.</p> \n<h3>Nobody knows how much money they are owed</h3> \n<p>The easiest way to explain the problem with transparency in the industry is like this: it doesn't exist. There is no comprehensive, unbiased database that tracks information that can be used to determine everything from who plays the bass on a popular song to who needs to be paid when a song is streamed. Instead, information is scattered around. All labels and producers and artists hold information about the work in their catalog, but there's no way for anyone else to access that information.</p> \n<p>""The fact that you can’t pick up any piece of music and know who played bass on it is insanity. If people don’t know you played on things, you don’t get hired,"" Jeffrey Boxer of the C3 Coalition for Artists told me.</p> \n<p>He's right. We have the technology at this point to completely catalogue the metadata for each and every song. Some companies, like Price's Audiam, are already doing that. Audiam works with more than a thousand artists and publishers, including Imagem, the largest independent music publisher in the world, to build metadata and get revenue from digital streams.<strong> </strong>But what they're doing is not standardized.</p> \n<p>These difficulties in tracking information about individual songs are a problem in the streaming age.</p> \n<p>Some songs are misattributed, and the money that streaming services owe the artists is going to the wrong people. Some songs simply aren't assigned to anyone, and no one is sure where their payments are supposed to go. That money goes into a black box<strong> </strong>before it ever gets to artists, and no one gets paid for a play.</p> \n<p>I talked to dozens of people about how black boxes in music industry pay out, and every one of them said at least 8 percent of money isn't being paid out and at least 15 percent of money is going to the wrong person. Some people said as much as 30 percent of total revenue is misplaced every year.</p> \n<q>""The fact that you can’t pick up any piece of music and know who played bass on it is insanity""</q> \n<p>This is a problem that streaming services say they want to fix, but just can't.</p> \n<p>""We are big proponents of transparency, in part because we’ve had copyright holders use the lack of transparency to negotiate with us in ways that we don’t think are fair,"" Mike Herring, the CFO of Pandora, told me. ""If we had transparency about what everyone owns, we would have options about whether or not to play music.""</p> \n<p>Streaming services don't have the information to create a transparent catalog themselves, even if they were to put millions of dollars into building one. ""When I look at a streaming service for one of my bands, not only do I not know exactly how many times a song was played, I can't dig into their databases to see if they even are paying the right people,"" Price told me. ""[Streaming services] whine to me about how hard it is to figure out who to pay. Why don’t you go be in a band and see how hard that is?""</p> \n<p>Price bases that distinction in passion, but it has deep roots in the music industry, too. There's a great divide between the artists who make the music at every stage and the people who help distribute that music, be they labels or technology companies.</p> \n<h3>The road to achieving transparency</h3> \n<p>Forming a system for transparency is actually pretty simple, but it requires a ton of work that no one is willing to invest the time, human resources, or money in. To have a completely transparent music ecosystem, two things are needed.</p> \n<p>The first is that technology companies have to share with artists how often their music is being played, as well as where and when. Tech companies also need to show how many times songs are streamed and directly connect that to a payout. Some companies, like Pandora, are already doing this, but companies like Spotify could do much better, Price told me. (Spotify did not respond for comment on this story despite multiple requests for an interview.)</p> \n<p>The second is that a database has to be created that says exactly who is responsible for which pieces and at what percentage on every single existing song and composition. That database would also explicitly state who owns each song, who owns the master copyright, and which parties were attached to every song. Ideally, this would be accompanied by the ability to attach metadata to songs that would embed this information into the actual song digitally, so that there would never be an excuse for the wrong person getting paid or no one getting paid at all.</p> \n<p>There are plenty of people who could work to fix transparency problems, but so far few are willing to do so. Though transparency is something that benefits every single sector of the industry, it's not easy to achieve. Transparency requires time, energy, and knowledge, but it also requires a desire for action.</p> \n<p>""If anyone actually cared about this subject and really wanted to do something, they could do something. If everyone joined up together, this really could be fixed,"" Price told me.</p> \n<h3>How technology could help save the music industry</h3> \n<p>How do you lament the fall of an industry and claim it is obsolete, yet be thrilled for its future at the same time? Well, you create technology that can fix it.</p> \n<p>How that looks, of course, varies greatly. There are technology companies like the streaming platforms that distribute songs to listeners, and there are the new companies springing up inside the traditional format of the music industry and trying to make things like publishing contracts and record label deals much more transparent and much more technology-friendly. Technology, they say, will dictate everything about the future of music, even if it's going to be a messy, painful overthrow to get it there.</p> \n<p>One of these businesses is Kobalt, a publishing company that moonlights as an international technology company founded in 2000. According to Kobalt's website, the company represents, on average, more than 40 percent of the top 100 songs and albums in both the US and the UK. When I spoke to Ryan Wright, SVP of marketing at Kobalt, in January, he told me that the company represented 65 of that week's top 100 songs.<strong> </strong>Kobalt represents songwriters and gives them the tools to see how much money they are making in <em>real time</em>. Kobalt partners with streaming services to get data and then, as a publisher, shows that information directly to its songwriters through an online portal.<strong> </strong>Through the Kobalt portal, all clients can access, dissect, and sort the money they are making and exactly where it is coming from. Every client has a login. Instead of looking at streams on Spotify and YouTube and Pandora and wherever else, artists can see everything in one spot.</p> \n<p>""Thanks to streaming, today one global hit can unlock millions of different revenue streams, triggering billions of transactions and micropayments that add up to more demand and music usage than the world has ever known,"" says Willard Ahdritz, founder of Kobalt.</p> \n<p>Think about that. Millions of different revenue streams. Billions of transactions. Infinite usage all of the time, from all over the world. Dealing with that, with those numbers and all of that money and the dozens of platforms being used, isn't something record executives are equipped to handle — and it's how the tech industry gained such a firm foothold in the music industry, to the point that today it's almost impossible to see where one entity begins and another ends.</p> \n<p>Is Kobalt, a seemingly traditional publishing company that represents everyone from the B-52s and Fleetwood Mac to Max Martin, a part of the infrastructure of yesteryear, or is it a technology company trying to make money? What is Pandora? Where does Jay Z's new high-fidelity streaming company <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/3/30/8314869/tidal-jay-z-streaming"">Tidal</a> fit into the equation? The line between the technology used to distribute the money and the people representing artists is becoming blurrier and blurrier.</p> \n<p>Technology created connections between musicians and their fans that never existed before. Artists sometimes spoke frankly to newspaper reporters, but we have never had the kind of connection that we have now when Iggy Azalea tweets about her feuds with Papa John's—for better or for worse.</p> \n<q> Every party thinks the other party should take responsibility for the problems, but so far no one has</q> \n<p>""Finding a fan base is actually the easiest thing now. I have so many friends that are making a really good living not on a label, selling their album and their merchandise right on their site,"" recording artist Niia told me. ""You don't have to tour around the country. You can make a Facebook page and do the same thing.""</p> \n<p>For musicians, that means potential fans are everywhere. A band from Chicago can now have fans in Mississippi, or across the ocean. In that way, technology is the savior of bands who were lonely and underplayed and underappreciated. But it's a salvation that comes with a cost.</p> \n<p>""We’re not in any way opposed to any technological approach to anything,"" Jeffrey Boxer of the C3 Artists Coalition told me. ""I want to know what the business model is that says we’re going to ... use the work of artists for free."" For Boxer and other advocates of artists, the greatest fear in the development of streaming is that suddenly money will stay in the hands of the technology creators and never get back to them.</p> \n<p>Boxer knows technology isn't something artists can afford to brush off. Those who make the most of a new technology make the most money off of it. The few artists who can take a moral stance against a new technology — think Taylor Swift and Spotify — are the ones who can already afford to do so. Instead, what artists as a group have to do, and have done with most format shifts, is weather the storm and fight once the waters have calmed.</p> \n<p>Whose job it is to fix the transparency and technological issues surrounding music is one of the greatest trials the industry has to face. Fixing the problems with transparency and infrastructure in particular will take eons of time and resources that no sector wants to put forth. Every party thinks the other party should take responsibility for the problems, but so far no one has.</p> \n<h3>Why music needs to embrace the future</h3> \n<p>People have always found ways to consume music. They will buy records again if they have to in order to hear the new Kendrick Lamar album. They will torrent music from other countries if they must. What's at stake in the future of music is whether music in America can be profitable and egalitarian enough to support the middle class of American musicians, and how the industry will have to change to accommodate that desire.</p> \n<p>Right now it seems the easiest solution is to integrate technology into the structure that already exists. Ideally, a company like Kobalt could help bring labels and publishers and all of the groups in between to a higher level of technological competency that allows them to be more transparent with where money is going and how people will be paid, and also help companies such as Pandora and Spotify know who owns what music.</p> \n<q>Taking away streaming at this point could collapse the industry into a Napster-esque phase of torrenting</q> \n<p>""The more educated people are about the pros and cons of streaming, the greater the pressure will be on the music industry to be more transparent and challenge its outdated model and infrastructure,"" Ahdritz of Kobalt told me. ""I’m excited to see this new chapter raise expectations in the industry, demanding greater transparency, efficiency, and empowerment for music creators.""</p> \n<p>Everything about the structure of the music industry is precarious right now. The streaming services that consumers love don't have great relationships with the labels and publishers who make the deals, and artists feel like they're being ripped off by putting their songs onto a streaming platform. Yet streaming is ubiquitous and rapidly becoming the standard in the music industry. Taking away streaming at this point could completely collapse the industry into a Napster-esque phase of torrenting.</p> \n<p>But the future of music won't allow for any creativity or evolution if the structure of the music industry isn't forced to accommodate the technology of the future. Without infrastructure and transparency and technology, the fragile industry that exists right now could very quickly crumble. The last thing artists need is an industry that can't support them or their work because it's disorganized and unwilling to change.</p> \n<hr> \n<p><strong>Correction:</strong> This piece has been corrected to reflect the fact that songwriters, not performers, are lobbying to remove the compulsory license.

It is almost the spitting image of <a href=""https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/e4/c6/1b/e4c61bf0a5a8aaed16985800270660e1.jpg"">this famous photograph</a>, with businessmen racing, panicked, from billowing clouds of dust behind them. The photograph, of course, is from September 11, 2001. The businessmen are racing from the collapse of the World Trade Center.</p> \n<p>Whedon sets his action continents away from Manhattan, in Africa, and the dust clouds are much closer and more ominous in the film than they were in the photo. Still, the echo is unmistakable.</p> \n<p>But in the world of the Avengers, there are few consequences. There's property damage, and PR damage, but no one dies. It's tragedy reimagined as cartoon — a version two steps removed that lets us glance at the real wound in our peripheral vision.</p> \n<q class=""center"" aria-hidden=""true"">In the wake of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, America turned to superheroes to rewrite that day so that it ended as one where nobody had to die</q> \n<p>Superhero films are the dominant cinematic force right now. They make money hand over fist, and their releases turn into genuine pop culture events. But we miss their point — we miss the <i>why</i> of them. These films are pop culture's most sustained response to tragedy. In the wake of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, America turned to superpowered heroes to rewrite that day so that it ended as one where nobody had to die.</p> \n<p>Superhero movies, in some ways, aim to turn that day into something out of myth, like the ancients might have recast a real tragedy as an epic tale of heroism. This is one of the ways we process grief — in our tales.</p> \n<p>And the further we get into the cinematic superhero era — now almost 15 years long — the more explicit these films get about both their real-world impetus and about the way America responded to that tragedy.</p> \n<p>They began, as with America's actual reaction to 9/11, as films about vulnerable individuals finding the strength in themselves to overcome tragedy. Then they became stories about beings and organizations with nearly infinite power that would do whatever necessary to keep the homeland safe. And now, increasingly, they are grappling with the costs of the retribution they've doled out, and the security systems they've built.</p> \n<p>First, though, the myths.</p> \n<h3>The Noah hypothesis</h3> \n<p>Humans use stories for a lot of reasons, but one of the most prominent, long-lasting ones is to provide moral instruction, a frame of reference for how to understand the world around us.</p> \n<p>Talk to any folklorist, and you'll hear dozens of stories that cultures all around the world developed, seemingly independent of one another, from the mythic to the mundane. Nearly every culture on Earth has a story of a cataclysmic flood that wipes all life from the world, saving a small handful of people. Lots of cultures have stories of wild men living in the wilderness, giant and hairy and not quite human. Many, many cultures have versions of the Cinderella story (though it's easier to trace <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/3/15/8214405/cinderella-fairy-tale-history"">the spread of this particular tale</a>).</p> \n<p>There are a bunch of explanations for these common stories, ranging from the literal (all of this really happened) to the conceptual (human beings are fairly alike all over, and we tend to have common fears and desires). In truth, it's probably a mix of both.</p> \n<div class=""float-right""><q aria-hidden=""true"">There's a kind of echo of how major world events twist themselves into new forms, pretzel-like, through our pop culture</q></div> \n<p>You don't have to have a global flood to get to the idea of Noah. All you need is a flood big and deadly enough for people to have heard about it. Similarly, you don't need to have an actual Sasquatch to get Bigfoot myths. You only need to have subconscious remnants of when there were two intelligent humanoid species sharing the same planet, battling for dominance, one slowly getting pushed farther and farther to the edges of the world.</p> \n<p>It's impossible to prove any of these theories, of course, and there's substantial evidence against the first one (in that the so-called <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Sea_deluge_hypothesis"">Black Sea deluge</a> seems unlikely to have happened). But it's fun to imagine our ancestors coming across Neanderthals and not knowing what to make of them, then telling stories about them.</p> \n<p>And there's a kind of echo of how major world events twist themselves into new forms, pretzel-like, through our popular culture. We tell these stories, over and over, to ourselves, because we want to rob old tragedies and fears of their power. We want to mute them somehow, to make them less potent in our everyday lives.</p> \n<p>Seen through that lens, the superhero boom is about the need for escapism, maybe, and the sheer fun of watching big-screen spectacle done well, to be sure. But it's also about keeping an image of our most recent tragedy where we can't quite see it but where the dim vibrations of its sorrow still reverberate. It's a kind of solemn recollection, buried in the middle of a bunch of popcorn fun.</p> \n<p>And the memories are getting more explicit.</p> \n<h3>The most potent images of 9/11, reimagined as popcorn cinema</h3> \n<p>The first glimpse most Americans got of director <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000600/?ref_=nv_sr_1"">Sam Raimi's</a> first <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0145487/?ref_=nm_flmg_dr_7""><em>Spider-Man</em></a> movie came in the summer of 2001. It was a trailer consisting of footage that had been shot just for the trailer, not the film. In it, a team of bank thieves race from the scene of their crime in a helicopter, only to find themselves trapped in a spider's web suspended between the twin towers of the World Trade Center.</p> \n<p><iframe frameborder=""0"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/3Txwq7FGtBw"" height=""315"" width=""560""></iframe></p> \n<p>A few months later, the trailer was pulled, for obvious reasons.</p> \n<p>When <em>Spider-Man</em> debuted several months later on Friday, May 3, 2002, it was the sort of <a href=""http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=spiderman.htm"">box office sensation</a> that comes along all too rarely. It made $114 million at the domestic box office in its first three days of release — shattering the record of $90 million set just a few months earlier by the first <em>Harry Potter</em> film. It kicked off the era of superhero films, which now looks as if it will last roughly until the heat death of the universe.</p> \n<p>What's eerie about these films is how many of them have incorporated the most significant images and events of 9/11 into their popcorn movie fun. <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/4/30/8519829/avengers-age-of-ultron-review/in/8285314""><em>Age of Ultron</em></a> is just one of the more recent examples of a trend running more than a decade.</p> \n<div class=""float-right""><q aria-hidden=""true"">This time, Superman is there. This time, the falling man lives.</q></div> \n<p>For instance, take 2006's <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0348150/?ref_=nv_sr_1""><em>Superman Returns</em></a>, one of the most poetic and best films of the recent superhero boom. In it, director <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001741/?ref_=nv_sr_1"">Bryan Singer</a> points out, frequently, that Superman has been missing for five years. He flew off into space to visit the ruins of Krypton, his shattered home world, and then returned. Singer doesn't make direct note of it, but five years before 2006 was 2001. The implicit point is that the only way September 11 could happen in a world with Superman in it would be if he were somehow missing.</p> \n<p>The tone of <em>Superman Returns</em> is at once mournful and joyous. The film is sad that no Superman actually exists and grateful for the idea that humans have invented him to save us from imagined tragedy. It, too, uses the images of 9/11 to add emotional resonance. In one of the film's most potent moments, a man falls from a tall height, the ground rushing toward him. He's a rough echo of 9/11's famous <a href=""http://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/man-falls-to-his-death-from-the-world-trade-center-after-news-photo/678240"">falling man</a>, except Singer flips and skews the angles he shoots from, so our brain expects the opposite to happen.</p> \n<p>And it does. This time, Superman is there. This time, the falling man lives.</p> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3683458/supermanreturns.0.gif"" alt=""Superman Returns"" data-chorus-asset-id=""3683458""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Superman saves a falling man in <i>Superman Returns</i>. (Warner Brothers)</p> \n<h3>Art imitating life imitating art</h3> \n<p>There is, of course, a bit of chicken-and-egg thinking in the idea that the superhero boom was born out of 9/11.</p> \n<p>Consider this in terms of the famous idea that the Beatles healed America's psychic wounds by <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=It3Cctk6BRs"">appearing on <em>The Ed Sullivan Show</em></a> a few months after John F. Kennedy's assassination. It's not that tragedy made the band huge. Rock 'n' roll was a major cultural force in the 1960s, and, thus, the Beatles were always going to be huge. But the existence of a tragic event preceding their arrival on American shores made the pure joy of their early singles feel all the more like a necessary corrective. Here was a chance to feel something else for a moment.</p> \n<p>Similarly, it's not as if there weren't successful superhero movies in the pre-<em>Spider-Man</em> world. Between 1978 and 1987, <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0078346/?ref_=nv_sr_3"">four movies about Superman</a> found varying levels of success, just as <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096895/?ref_=nv_sr_3"">four films about Batman</a> did between 1989 and 1998. Even in terms of Marvel characters, the vampire hunter <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120611/?ref_=fn_al_tt_2"">Blade's star vehicle</a> took off in 1998, while <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120903/?ref_=nv_sr_4"">the X-Men</a> saw their first big film take home significant box office earnings in 2000.</p> \n<p>Hollywood had seen several superhero stories rake in cash <i>before</i> 9/11, and that meant more superhero stories would have followed regardless of national events. <em>Spider-Man</em>, a well-made, highly entertaining romp through the urban skyways of New York, likely would have done quite well in a world without terrorist attacks.</p> \n<div class=""float-left""><q aria-hidden=""true"">The first two superhero films wholly produced in the post-9/11 world have hints of the tragedy in them, but they never look directly at it</q></div> \n<p>But it's also interesting to consider how the filmmakers who make superhero films have increasingly seemed to engage with the events of 9/11 as one of the primary influences behind their storytelling. How could they not? If the most common way to refer to the collapse of the World Trade Center in the news media was as ""something out of a movie,"" then who better to avert such a crisis than a super-strong, super-good being?</p> \n<p>At first, the images were more suggestive; they didn't make anything as explicit as Whedon did in <em>Ultron</em> or Singer in <em>Superman Returns</em>. <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0290334/?ref_=nv_sr_1""><em>X2</em></a> (2003) and <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0316654/?ref_=nv_sr_1""><em>Spider-Man 2</em></a> (2004), the first two superhero films wholly produced in the post-9/11 world, contain hints of the tragedy, but they never look directly at it. In the first, a superpowered mutant all too easily infiltrates the White House (a major fear at the time, but one that hadn't actually happened), while in the second, Spider-Man does everything he can to save New Yorkers from a horrible subway crash, nearly losing his life in the process. He's handed between passengers on the train, arms stretched wide, Christ-like.</p> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""3683408"">\n<img src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3683408/spiderman2.jpg""> \n<div class=""caption""> \n<p>After Peter Parker saves a train full of subway passengers in <i>Spider-Man 2</i>, they hold him atop their heads in a Christ-like pose.</p> \n</div> \n</div> \n<p>As America's response to terrorism has shifted and mutated, superhero films have shifted and mutated along with it. While the central, city-destroying mayhem of these films remains much the same in the 14 years since the attacks, the depiction of that mayhem has grown more and more sophisticated.</p> \n<p><a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0468569/?ref_=nv_sr_1""><em>The Dark Knight</em></a> (2008) addresses nearly every method the Bush administration used to combat terrorism in superhero terms. <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0371746/?ref_=nv_sr_2""><em>Iron Man</em></a> (also 2008) is about a corporate weapons manufacturer who finds his chickens coming home to roost when he is held captive by apparent terrorists in the Middle East (he learns only belatedly how much death his bombs have sown.) In Marvel's early films, the elite military force of S.H.I.E.L.D. was unquestionably good. In later ones, it's been infiltrated by Nazis and must be destroyed.</p> \n<p>And look back at that first mega-hit, <em>Spider-Man</em>. It's a film about a boy who lives in New York. It's a film about a boy who gains tremendous power, which he uses without understanding how gravely important it is to not abuse said power. It's a film about a boy who sustains a grievous loss and emerges a little wiser for his troubles. There's a reason this film's impact was seismic. On some subconscious level, it was telling a story every American wanted to hear.</p> \n<h3>Why we keep going back to the superhero</h3> \n<p>It's not as if the idea of superhero films being a response to 9/11 (and the post-9/11 policies of the United States) has never come up before. It's often tempting to read popular films and TV shows in ways that play pop psychologist to the nation. America has been thoroughly psychoanalyzed as responding to World War II with lots of stories about men trying to make the best of a series of bad choices (see: the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_noir"">film noir genre</a> in general, <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0049730/?ref_=nv_sr_1"">many Westerns</a> of the '50s) and to Vietnam with a need for easy moral victories (<a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0075148/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1""><em>Rocky</em></a>, <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0076759/?ref_=nv_sr_2""><em>Star Wars</em></a>).</p> \n<p>But there's still something to be said for the <em>persistence</em> of superhero films, and the way they keep returning to this idea of intimate cataclysms, resolved through a small band of heroes saving the day. Many of these films conclude with battles of earth-shaking import that seem to ultimately boil down to one city, where the destruction rains down. There's something so <em>personal</em> about it.</p> \n<div class=""float-left""><q aria-hidden=""true"">Even though this is a cosmic war, it's staged with the intimacy of a terrorist attack</q></div> \n<p>Look at Whedon's <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0848228/?ref_=nv_sr_1"">first </a><a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0848228/?ref_=nv_sr_1""><em>Avengers</em></a><a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0848228/?ref_=nv_sr_1""> film</a>, released in 2012. Its concluding battle features a rift opening up in the sky above Manhattan; spaceships carrying alien warriors stream down toward skyscrapers, spreading death and horror.</p> \n<p>There's no real <em>reason</em> for the scene to be structured and shot this way, beyond the idea of aliens coming from above. Indeed, most pre-9/11 superhero films featured more earthbound supervillain plots. But it <i>is</i> structured and shot this way. Even though this is a cosmic war, it's staged with the intimacy of a terrorist attack.</p> \n<p>Compare that with the other major pop film trend to resonate in the wake of 9/11 — the fantasy epic. Both <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0241527/?ref_=nv_sr_1""><em>Harry Potter</em></a> and <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120737/?ref_=nv_sr_1""><em>Lord of the Rings</em></a> saw cinematic adaptations skyrocket in the early 2000s, but the fantasy boomlet ultimately fizzled out, under a surge of subpar <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0499448/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1""><em>Narnia</em></a> and <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0385752/?ref_=nv_sr_1""><em>Golden Compass</em></a><em> </em>movies. People wanted to see pure good versus pure evil, pitched in outright, massive battle, but only for a little while.</p> \n<p>Superhero stories give us a good that is more readily recognizable, more human (in that these are ultimately just human beings with outsize personality traits manifesting as superpowers), while also offering smaller-scale evils. These are not stories of war. They're stories of street fights powerful enough to seem like war. Buildings collapse, but the heroes are supposed to save everybody in them, so that they're empty toys toppling over.</p> \n<p>I think this is why there's been such massive outcry against the films that <em>don't</em> keep one eye on the human cost of these battles. Consider 2013's <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0770828/?ref_=nv_sr_1""><em>Man of Steel</em></a>, a Superman film that concludes with a city-leveling battle that seems to feel immense awe in the face of all of those buildings falling over from the battle being waged by near-gods among them. There's little attention paid to anyone who might be inside those buildings, and director <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0811583/?ref_=tt_ov_dr"">Zack Snyder</a> doesn't pause to let us know if they're okay or even if the buildings are occupied. Many found that it resonated a little too closely with the events that superhero films obscure — there was <a href=""http://news.moviefone.com/2013/06/18/man-of-steel-destruction-cost-analysis/"">so much suggested death</a> in whole cityscapes crumbling, and many of the shots seemed to directly recall TV news coverage of the 9/11 attacks. (The film's followup — 2016's <i>Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice </i>— goes to hilarious lengths to explain that the various buildings being destroyed in it are completely empty.)</p> \n<p>Wrote veteran comic book writer <a target=""new"" href=""http://thrillbent.com/blog/man-of-steel-since-you-asked/"">Mark Waid</a>:</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>But once more–and this is where I knew we were headed someplace really awful–once more, Superman showed not the slightest split-second of concern for the people around them. Particularly in this last sequence, his utter disregard for the collateral damage was just jaw-dropping as they just kept crashing through buildings full of survivors. I’m not suggesting he stop in the middle of a super-powered brawl to save a kitten from a tree, but even Brandon Routh thought to use his heat vision on the fly to disintegrate deadly falling debris after a sonic boom. From everything shown to us from the moment he put on the suit, Superman rarely if ever bothered to give the safety and welfare of the people around him one bit of thought.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>In this way, the films from Marvel Studios have always had a leg up on their competitors. They offer the destruction, but not the death. There are always spectators the heroes drag out of the way. <em>Age of Ultron</em>, in particular, is often shot from the point of view of bystanders and passersby, people who were unlucky enough to wander into this battle. And yet, in every battle, the heroes do their level best to get everybody out, even if it puts them in harm's way.</p> \n<p>It's the release valve, the escape clause. We experience the nausea that comes with recognizing the world we live in, where mass death can be strangely intimate, but also the joy of having somebody there to stop it.</p> \n<p>Yet even Marvel increasingly embraces the way the superhero echoes have curdled. In 2016's <i>Captain America: Civil War</i>, the Avengers squabble over whether to submit to government oversight. Where once they saved the world, they now are seen as more likely to doom it. Superpower ambivalence — both when it comes to costumed heroes and nation states — is catching.</p> \n<h3>Lost in ritual</h3> \n<p>Superhero movies will not be dominant forever. For one thing, Hollywood is overloading on them in the years to come, which is as good a method as any to make viewers sick of them. <a href=""http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=avengers2.htm""><em>Age of Ultron</em></a><a href=""http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=avengers2.htm"">'s box office</a>, while spectacular, fell short of <a href=""http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=avengers11.htm""><em>Avengers</em></a><a href=""http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=avengers11.htm"">' box office</a> in the United States. Somewhere along the way — and probably sooner rather than later — we'll work this particular psychic need out of our systems and move on to the next cinematic trend.</p> \n<p>What's more, the movies themselves are growing more and more brazen about confronting the chief reason they became so popular. In addition to the shot of people running from the cloud of rubble described above, Whedon's <em>Age of Ultron</em> (along with the 2014 Marvel release <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1843866/?ref_=nv_sr_2""><em>Captain America: The Winter Soldier</em></a>) is a blistering critique of the NSA security state, of a world where people are trusted to care for themselves so little that they must be always watched (or spied upon) by their betters. <i>Civil War</i>, as mentioned, goes even further.</p> \n<div class=""float-right""><q aria-hidden=""true"">Whatever we're working out through these movies, it's erupting out of the subtext into the text, bit by bit</q></div> \n<p>In <em>Iron Man</em>, the first film from Marvel Studios, Tony Stark tries to change to better himself, to right past sins. But in <em>Age of Ultron</em>, he realizes that nothing he's done has mattered. So scarred is Tony by what happened in the first <i>Avengers</i>, he inadvertently creates even greater horrors out of his own fears. His attempt to bring peace to Earth still creates war. He's still making weapons, everywhere he goes.</p> \n<p>Increasingly, superhero films aren't just dealing with the aftereffects of 9/11. They're dealing with America's inability to effectively safeguard itself from everything all of the time. Whatever we're working out through these movies, it's erupting out of the subtext into the text, bit by bit.</p> \n<p>Maybe that increasingly confrontational boldness is why we've turned these movies into borderline rituals, like a kind of exposure therapy, where we get greater and greater access to that which we fear.</p> \n<p>New superhero tales release around the same times every year (there has been a new superhero movie opening in theaters on the first weekend of May in every year since 2009), and those of us who enjoy them dutifully haul ourselves to the theaters, to see familiar faces and new friends. They've become holidays, in other words, complete with their own continued practices and familiar comforts. They're ways to mark the passing of years and seasons, ways to glimpse, slightly, the things we might otherwise wish to forget, especially as time marches on.</p> \n<p>In 2013, when I covered San Diego Comic-Con for Grantland, <a href=""http://grantland.com/hollywood-prospectus/a-day-inside-comic-cons-hall-h-worshipping-in-the-ultimate-movie-church/"">I wrote</a> a bit about this tendency to attach an almost religious fervor to these sorts of movies.</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>It’s easy for me to be cynical about all of this. I’m steeped in news of how the entertainment industry works, and I’m increasingly tired of pointless action blockbusters, and I lament the loss of the human amid computerized specters and formulaic screenplays. But I am an agnostic inside the movie church, someone who chooses not to buy into the collective faith generated there by those who believe, all evidence to the contrary, in the possibility of a summer when all the movies, at last, might be good.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>I am able to catch better visions of that all-consuming faith a little more with every passing year. Those of us who watch these films have become superhero fundamentalists, of a sort, shuffling in to see what cinematic wonders have been cooked up for us this year. We do our very best to not look too closely at the things flickering in our peripheral vision, the things animating the desire to watch a world where no one need die, because there will always be somebody there to catch you when you fall. The deluge is long past us now, but we still gather around the fire to tell stories, lest we forget.</p> \n</div>",Music
The 2015 Tony Awards: the 5 things you need to know,http://www.vox.com/2015/6/8/8745009/tony-awards-2015-winners-wrapup,Watch these videos and know as much about the awards as someone who watched the whole thing.,"<p>The fact that the Tony Awards continue to be broadcast on a major broadcast network feels a bit archaic in 2015.</p> \n<p><!--  ########  BEGIN SNIPPET  ########  --></p> \n<div class=""chorus-snippet s-related"" data-analytics-action=""link:related"" data-analytics-category=""article"">\n<span class=""s-related__title"">Related</span> <!-- Add links here --><a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/6/7/8744153/tonys-2015-winners"">All of the 2015 Tony winners</a>\n</div> \n<p>The show is <a href=""http://www.avclub.com/tvclub/ithe-66th-annual-tony-awardsi-80979"">routinely one of the best awards presentations</a> out there and the most reliable way for Americans of all stripes to keep up with the New York theater scene. Most years feel like a sort of Broadway family reunion, with the stage's biggest stars uniting to present awards and pal around with each other.</p> \n<p>But the New York theater scene holds less and less influence over American pop culture with every passing year. Where stage plays used to provide a direct pipeline of talent to film and the early days of television, and where musicals used to dominate the pop charts, it's much harder to see those links nowadays. There's nothing wrong with this, but it has made the Tony Awards feel ever more like a curio.</p> \n<p>Still, the Tonys are a fun watch, and at their best they allow for stirring moments that bring the best of Broadway to your TV screen. A show like <a href=""http://funhomebroadway.com/""><em>Fun Home</em></a>, with a lot on its mind, will get few better chances to sell itself than allowing its youngest star to belt out a song about her character having the first inkling of a thought that she might be attracted to women.</p> \n<p><iframe width=""560"" height=""315"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/Y4bV3IP_Zww"" frameborder=""0""></iframe></p> \n<p>So if you have a chance to track down the Tonys, give them a quick look. But if you didn't get a chance to watch and just want to sound smart should you be drawn into a conversation about them, here are five things worth knowing.</p> \n<h3>1) The night's big winners were <em>Fun Home</em> and <em>The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time</em>\n</h3> \n<p>Each work took home five prizes — including awards for Best Show (musical for <em>Fun Home</em> and play for <a href=""http://www.curiousonbroadway.com/""><em>Curious Incident</em></a>), Best Direction, and Best Actor in a Leading Role (<a href=""http://www.juilliard.edu/journal/1412/curious-incident-young-alum-who-made-good"">Alex Sharp</a> for <em>Curious Incident </em>and <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0148964/?ref_=nv_sr_2"">Michael Cerveris</a> for <em>Fun Home</em>). <em>Fun Home</em> also took home awards for Score (the music and lyrics of a musical) and Book (the characters, storyline, and dialogue between songs). <em>Curious Incident</em> won prizes for its set design and lighting.</p> \n<p>Both works are adaptations of books. <em>Curious Incident</em> adapts <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Curious-Incident-Dog-Night-Time/dp/1400032717/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1433734294&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=the+curious+incident+of+the+dog+in+the+nighttime&amp;pebp=1433734296056&amp;perid=1X7ZYZW773FSASCEW92R"">Mark Haddon's novel</a> about an autistic teenager who tries to discover who killed a neighborhood dog, while <em>Fun Home</em> adapts <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Fun-Home-Tragicomic-Alison-Bechdel/dp/0618871713/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1433734262&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=fun+home+alison+bechdel"">Alison Bechdel's graphic memoir</a> where her coming of age and coming out as a lesbian is juxtaposed with the life and death of her closeted gay father.</p> \n<p><em>Curious Incident</em> was a heavily expected winner. As a British import, the show had several advantages. (The Tonys, like most American awards shows, are routinely wowed by the Brits.) It's been a substantial success, especially for a play.</p> \n<p><em>Fun Home</em>, however, was seen as a bit of an underdog against the new musical version of George Gershwin's <a href=""http://www.anamericaninparisbroadway.com/""><em>An American in Paris</em></a><em>. </em>Both musicals scored 12 nominations, but <em>American</em> had a lighter tone and dealt with less serious subject matter. When things are mostly equal, the Tonys usually go for the show that will play better on a national tour (since many of the voters are affiliated with such tours and make their money from them). But the overall emotional effect of <em>Fun Home</em> was so overwhelming that it ultimately proved undeniable.</p> \n<p>The Lincoln Center revival of <a href=""http://www.lct.org/shows/king-and-i/""><em>The King and I</em></a> and <em>An American in Paris</em> each won four awards. The former scored for Best Revival of a Musical and Best Actress in a Leading Role in a Musical for <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0641290/?ref_=nv_sr_1"">Kelli O'Hara</a>. <a href=""http://www.skylightbwy.com/""><em>Skylight</em></a> won Best Revival of a Play.</p> \n<p><iframe width=""560"" height=""315"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/pqbwpUlDOvE"" frameborder=""0""></iframe></p> \n<h3>2) It was a (somewhat) historic night for women</h3> \n<p><em>Fun Home</em>'s <a href=""http://www.ibdb.com/person.php?id=12488"">Jeanine Tesori</a> and <a href=""http://www.lisakron.org/"">Lisa Kron</a> were the first ever all-woman team to win the award for Best Score, and the show itself was the first show about a lesbian character to ever score a major run on Broadway, much less win a Tony for Best Musical.</p> \n<p><em>Curious Incident</em>'s <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marianne_Elliott_%28director%29"">Marianne Elliott</a> became just the sixth female winner of Best Direction of a Play — though one of the previous winners was Elliott herself, for her work on <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_Horse_(play)""><em>War Horse</em></a>. (She shared that award with Tom Morris.) Women also won four of the night's six design prizes.</p> \n<p>Also, though this is much less substantive in nature, women were largely responsible for the night's best speeches, especially those of Leading Actress in a Play <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000545/?ref_=nv_sr_1"">Helen Mirren</a>, O'Hara, and Featured Actress in a Musical <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/name/nm4597798/?ref_=fn_al_nm_1"">Ruthie Ann Miles</a>.</p> \n<p><iframe width=""560"" height=""315"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/ArOrFMzbkoA"" frameborder=""0""></iframe></p> \n<h3>3) Kelli O'Hara finally won — and Helen Mirren is almost to an EGOT for playing one woman</h3> \n<p>If you really want to sound like you knew what the Tonys were all about, then you'll talk with your theater-minded pals about O'Hara finally — <em>finally</em> — breaking her long winless streak.</p> \n<p>One of the best stage performers of her generation, O'Hara has been nominated for five previous Tonys and lost all of them, including a nomination for the <a href=""http://www.lct.org/shows/rodgers-hammersteins-south-pacific/"">2008 </a><a href=""http://www.lct.org/shows/rodgers-hammersteins-south-pacific/""><em>South Pacific</em></a><a href=""http://www.lct.org/shows/rodgers-hammersteins-south-pacific/""> revival</a> that should have been a shoo-in. Much of the same team behind that revival reunited for <em>The King and I</em>, another musical by Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II, the most significant figures in American musical theater.</p> \n<p><iframe width=""560"" height=""315"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/MuNUnIeJtd4"" frameborder=""0""></iframe></p> \n<p>O'Hara is a wonderfully naturalistic and sincere performer in a medium that sometimes rewards over-the-top theatrics. Her chief competition was <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0155693/?ref_=nv_sr_3"">Kristin Chenoweth</a> for <a href=""http://www.roundabouttheatre.org/Shows-Events/On-the-Twentieth-Century.aspx""><em>On the Twentieth Century</em></a>, and the two performers (both brilliant) could not be more night and day in their approaches to material. Chenoweth is bubble and fizz; O'Hara is heart and soul. O'Hara's win finally ends a Tony speculation period somewhat akin to that time when <a href=""http://www.salon.com/2014/01/11/the_medias_kate_winslet_problem/"">Kate Winslet was never winning Oscars</a>.</p> \n<p><iframe width=""560"" height=""315"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/2gdND5wVYnI"" frameborder=""0""></iframe></p> \n<p>Meanwhile, Mirren won her Tony for playing Queen Elizabeth II in <a href=""http://theaudiencebroadway.com/""><em>The Audience</em></a>, written by <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0604948/?ref_=fn_al_nm_1"">Peter Morgan</a> and directed by<a href=""http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0197636/?ref_=nv_sr_1""> Stephen Daldry</a>. Morgan actually wrote the script that propelled Mirren to her Oscar for <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0436697/?ref_=nm_knf_i4""><em>The Queen</em></a>, in which she played ... Queen Elizabeth II.</p> \n<p>Now, Mirren already had three legs of the EGOT — Emmy, Grammy, Oscar, and Tony — before she won her third Tony for <em>The Audience</em>. (Her Emmy, amusingly enough, was for playing Queen Elizabeth I, rather than II.) But if she could somehow win another Emmy for playing Queen Elizabeth II, she would have won EGOT's three acting prizes all for playing the same real woman, which would be unprecedented.</p> \n<h3>4) The broadcast gave over way too much of its time to unnominated musicals</h3> \n<p><a href=""http://findingneverlandthemusical.com/""><em>Finding Neverland</em></a> — the musical version of the <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0308644/?ref_=nv_sr_1"">2004 Johnny Depp film</a> about the creation of <em>Peter Pan</em> — received no nominations, despite a heavy push from film mogul Harvey Weinstein. And yet there the show was, with its biggest stars, <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1285162/?ref_=nv_sr_1"">Matthew Morrison</a> and <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001288/?ref_=nv_sr_1"">Kelsey Grammer</a> (as Captain Hook!), belting away at a song from the production in the awards' final hour.</p> \n<p>It looked <em>awful</em>, like the sort of thing that would be interrupted by a ""three months earlier"" title card before flashing back to see how things had gotten so catastrophic so quickly. But it was in the broadcast.</p> \n<p><iframe width=""560"" height=""315"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/X-bl00nw3v0"" frameborder=""0""></iframe></p> \n<p>The biggest thing the Tonys have going for them are the musical numbers, which aren't going to pop up in too many other places on TV. So it makes sense for the awards to want to cram more and more of them into the show's running time. But where the performances used to be limited to the nominees for Best Musical and Best Revival of a Musical, they've now spread to anything else the Tonys can think of, which is how the team behind <em>Fun Home</em> got rushed off the stage during its acceptance speech in honor of a tribute to <a href=""http://www.jerseyboysinfo.com/broadway/""><em>Jersey Boys</em></a>.</p> \n<p><iframe width=""560"" height=""315"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/JhaJTZ5m6Dc"" frameborder=""0""></iframe></p> \n<h3>5) The hosts were annoying</h3> \n<p>Chenoweth and <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001086/?ref_=nv_sr_1"">Alan Cumming</a> hosted the show, and in true Tony fashion, they spent almost the entire time singing and dancing, and even popping up in the middle of other musical numbers here and there. The Tonys usually have pretty good hosts, and Chenoweth and Cumming certainly weren't disastrous. But their constant presence bordered on irritating, and much of their shtick wore thin very quickly.</p> \n<p>Is it any wonder that the biggest laughs of the night were reserved for a decidedly atypical presentation by <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0202970/?ref_=nv_sr_1"">Larry David</a> and <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0004517/?ref_=nv_sr_1"">Jason Alexander</a> in advance of the night's final award?</p> \n<p><iframe width=""560"" height=""315"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vj6maulKLs8"" frameborder=""0""></iframe></p> \n<p>The Tonys could do with a bit more off-the-wall comedy.

But what may <em>not</em> be obvious is what the game is, why it's so popular, or even how to find it — especially because it's in Japanese, and most Americans don't make a general habit of searching for Japanese titles in their various app stores.</p> \n<p>But this game comes by its cult appeal honestly. Falling somewhere between The Sims and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamagotchi"">Tamagotchis</a> (the briefly popular ""electronic pets"" from the 1990s), it makes you the best pal of a bunch of neighborhood cats, who visit your home to eat the cat food and play with the cat toys you leave out for them. It's addictive, adorable, and completely free. And it will only take up a few spare seconds of your time, whenever you need to check in — though you just might find more and more excuses to check in as you coax more cats into your virtual home.</p> \n<p>Potential virtual cat owners, meet the felines of <a href=""http://nekoatsume.com/games/neko/enjoy/"">Neko Atsume</a>.</p> \n<h3>What is Neko Atsume?</h3> \n<p>Designed by the <a href=""http://www.hit-point.co.jp/"">Japanese company Hit-Point</a>, Neko Atsume is a mobile phone game that gives the player a small backyard area (which can later be expanded with an indoor area as well) where the stray cats of the neighborhood come to visit. The cats will only drop by if there's food, but if they like the food you give them, they'll stay to play with any cat toys you might have laying about. These toys can range from simple balls and stuffed mice to more elaborate cat jungle gyms.</p> \n<p>Here's what Neko Atsume looks like when you have a bunch of cats hanging around:</p> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""3780130"">\n<img src=""https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3780130/neko1.png""> \n<div class=""caption""> \n<p>More cats than any one person would know what to do with.</p> \n</div> \n</div> \n<p>After they're done feasting and playing, the cats will leave you some number of sardines. These offerings will either be normal gray sardines (which they leave with great frequency) or precious golden sardines (which they leave much more sparingly). You can buy more golden sardines with real money, but the cats are generous enough that you shouldn't really <em>have</em> to. Occasionally, the cats will also bring you a special gift they've found in their scrounging.</p> \n<p>The fish function as the game's currency, allowing you to buy more and more elaborate cat toys, which will attract more and more cats, who will bring you more and more fish. And on and on it goes.</p> \n<p>The game, in its current incarnation, features more than 40 different cats. Some of them are standard cats, but others wear costumes. There's a baseball player cat, a samurai cat, and a giant fat cat who eats all your food in one go.</p> \n<p>And what does ""neko atsume"" mean? Roughly translated, it means ""cat collecting,"" <a href=""http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2015-03-18-the-year-of-the-sheep-the-day-of-the-cat"">according to GamesIndustry.biz</a>.</p> \n<h3>How did people even come to know about this game?</h3> \n<p>Neko Atsume has climbed the charts in Japan, where there are enough mobile games about cats that Apple was able to <a href=""http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2015-03-18-the-year-of-the-sheep-the-day-of-the-cat"">run a promotion early in 2015</a> that centered on February 22, an informal holiday called ""the Day of the Cat."" It is so named because 2/22 can be spoken as ""nyan nyan nyan"" in Japanese, which is roughly similar to saying ""meow meow meow"" in English. (Yes, now you know where the name <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZZ7oFKsKzY"">""Nyan Cat""</a> comes from.) Though not an official holiday, enough people know about it that Apple's promotion proved a success and boosted Neko Atsume into the top 10 of all games sold in the country.</p> \n<p>Neko Atsume's slow-building popularity in other countries stems from the American video game press discovering it. Video game writers, who always keep an eye on what's going on in the Japanese gaming industry, were quick to praise the game, which is fairly easy to play even if you don't speak any Japanese.</p> \n<p>One of the earliest US-based posts about Neko Atsume was on <a href=""http://www.destructoid.com/japan-gets-the-best-games-again-neko-atsume-is-the-cutest-shit-289536.phtml"">the site Destructoid</a>. The game later received writeups from outlets like <a href=""http://kotaku.com/the-japanese-cat-game-we-can-t-stop-playing-1701250319"">Kotaku</a>, <a href=""http://motherboard.vice.com/read/this-adorable-japanese-cat-game-is-everywhere-and-we-tried-to-figure-it-out"">Vice's tech site Motherboard</a>, and <a href=""http://boingboing.net/2015/04/20/neko-atsume-cat-collecting.html"">Boing Boing's gaming site Offworld</a>. Soon, the game even earned its <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/nekoatsume/"">own subreddit</a>.</p> \n<p>Recently, the game has begun to cross slowly but surely into the mainstream, especially thanks to <a href=""http://thebillfold.com/2015/06/the-economics-of-neko-atsume/"">this story on the Billfold</a>, which satirizes the game's economics.</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>You wake up in the morning, put out cat food, painstakingly arrange the cat toys, and wait. When the cats come, they leave you a pile of dead things in exchange, as cats do. You, in turn, walk your basket of stinking fish to the market to buy more cat food and a cardboard box shaped like a car. No one drives cars anymore. You do not ask what happens to the fish you exchange for these cat toys, just like you do not ask what meat is in the thin soup they hand you, in its little cardboard bowl.</p> \n<p>That is what you eat. The cats eat food you recognize, except now someone has taped a piece of red cardboard with a cat pawprint to the can, as if to indicate that all food is for the cats now. You put out fresh sashimi, sometimes, arranged as best as you know how. The cats come, play, leave their dead fish. Another day ends.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<h3>Why is Neko Atsume fun?</h3> \n<p>Three reasons:</p> \n<div class=""align-left""> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3780342/catsvert.0.png"" alt=""Neko Atsume"" data-chorus-asset-id=""3780342""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Who could say no to these guys? (Hit-Point)</p> \n</div> \n<p><strong>1) It's about cute cats. </strong>C'mon. Everybody loves cute cats. And though the animations for the game's various cats are decidedly limited, they're charming. Half the fun of the game is seeing what the cats will do with a new toy, or seeing what the latest cat you've lured to visit you will look like. The game is about collecting cats, and it has perfected the element of trying to procure absolutely every possible item/cat the game has to offer and cultivating the best possible collection.</p> \n<p><strong>2) You can play it at almost any time. </strong>Whether you have a few minutes between meetings at work or you're on a flight, you can play Neko Atsume. It doesn't require a data connection, and checking in on the game can be done in as little as a few seconds. (Do the cats have food? If not, refill. Are there any cats present? If so, take in their majesty.) The platonic ideal of a smartphone game is something that can be played pretty much at will, and Neko Atsume comes very close.</p> \n<p><strong>3) It's hugely customizable. </strong>You can name your cats anything you want. You can take pictures of both your cats and their entire play area. You can share those pictures with friends. You can constantly switch out the toys on offer, or stick with a tried-and-true setup. It's hard to lose Neko Atsume. Instead, the game is all about giving you the tools to create your own perfect cat garden. That's immensely appealing, especially in mobile gaming, where not having a sophisticated controller rewards games that provide players with several different options in fairly simplistic fashion.</p> \n<p>There are, of course, lots more reasons to enjoy Neko Atsume, but the three above are a big part of why it seems to be taking over the world.</p> \n<h3>Can I watch somebody play for a while?</h3> \n<p>Absolutely! This excellent video by Kotaku will give you a good sense of what to expect:</p> \n<p><iframe width=""560"" height=""315"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/MmhTV3zSsbE"" frameborder=""0""></iframe></p> \n<h3>How much Japanese do you have to speak to enjoy Neko Atsume?</h3> \n<p>Zero. The entire game is in Japanese, but provided that you know how to follow visual cues, you'll be just fine.</p> \n<p>The one part of the game where not being able to speak the language hurts is at the very beginning, during the tutorial. However, if you simply follow the arrows on screen and keep swiping when they tell you to, you'll get through this very short section very quickly. (All you need to do is leave out a food dish and a red ball for the cats to play with.)</p> \n<p>From there, the game features a lot of Japanese text, but it also provides plenty of visual prompts that help tell you what you're meant to do.</p> \n<p>Consider, for instance, the game's main menu. Yes, the text is in Japanese, but the pictures are (hopefully) universal:</p> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3780362/nekomenu.0.png"" alt=""nekomenu.0.png"" data-chorus-asset-id=""3780362""></p> \n<div class=""caption""> \n<p>Don't worry too much. This will all become self-explanatory in time. (Hit-Point; photo illustration by Todd VanDerWerff/Vox)</p> \n</div> \n<p>The little images are (starting from the top left):</p> \n<p><strong>1) Your cat album: </strong>Here's where you can look at pictures and profiles of all the cats you've met. It'll also give you a sense of how many cats you have yet to find.</p> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""3780150"">\n<img src=""https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3780150/nekoalbum.png""> \n<div class=""caption""> \n<p>Bow before my utter mastery in the naming of cats!</p> \n</div> \n</div> \n<p><strong>2) The store: </strong>You'll spend a lot of time here, using your sardines to buy items like cat food and cat toys.</p> \n<p><strong>3) Inventory: </strong>This is where you keep the items you've purchased while you figure out where to place them in your backyard.</p> \n<p><strong>4) Camera: </strong>Use this button to take pictures of any cats that happen to be in your backyard, or pictures of the whole area at once. (You can also activate the camera by tapping and holding on any cat on the main screen.) Pictures of the entire backyard will show up in your phone's photo gallery; pictures of individual cats will appear in their profiles.</p> \n<p><strong>5) Garden: </strong>Click this button to return to your backyard to see your cats at play.</p> \n<p><strong>6) Sardines: </strong>Tap here to check on whether the cats have left you any sardines you need to collect. You can also access this option from the main screen, and you can collect all sardines at once by tapping the big button at the bottom:</p> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""3780318"">\n<img src=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3780318/fish.png""> \n<div class=""caption""> \n<p>Notice the button in the red box? That's how you collect all your fish at once.</p> \n</div> \n</div> \n<p><strong>7) Settings: </strong>This mostly lets you turn the music and sound effects volume up and down.</p> \n<p><strong>8) Gifts: </strong>Peruse any gifts your cats have left for you.</p> \n<p><strong>9) About: </strong>Learn information about the game — if you speak Japanese.</p> \n<p><strong>10) Change theme: </strong>If you have enough gold fish, you can use this button to purchase a new theme for your house and backyard.</p> \n<p><strong>11) News: </strong>Read about the latest updates to the game — if you speak Japanese.</p> \n<p><strong>12) Contact: </strong>Report problems and send messages, though this is yet another screen that will be difficult to use if you don't speak Japanese.</p> \n<p>If you want to know more about what the various screens say, the blog <a href=""https://welcometowonderland.wordpress.com/2015/03/25/how-to-play-neko-atsume/"">I Wish This Day Would Never End</a> has done a good job of translating them, as well as offering hints on how to play the game.</p> \n<h3>What items do the cats like best?</h3> \n<p>Here are three they're sure to love.</p> \n<p><strong>1)</strong> Early in the game, it can be tricky to find something that will draw out a significant number of cats. (The cats seem to be programmed to respond to certain items.) Perhaps surprisingly, this tiny, inexpensive orange ball seems to be a favorite of many of them.</p> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""3780320"">\n<img src=""https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3780320/orange.png""> \n<div class=""caption""> \n<p>It may look like an orange, but that's writing on top.</p> \n</div> \n</div> \n<p><strong>2) </strong>Later on, you'll want to give your cats a mat or someplace to hang out while they watch the other cats play. I had the best luck with this simple purple one.</p> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""3780322"">\n<img src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3780322/mat.png""> \n<div class=""caption""> \n<p>It's a relaxing purple mat, just like cats enjoy.</p> \n</div> \n</div> \n<p><strong>3) </strong>Once you've really got the sardines rolling in, there's no better way to keep the cats coming than to buy this cardboard house. You'll often find three or four cats hanging out in or around it.</p> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""3780298"">\n<img src=""https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3780298/catsinhouse.png""> \n<div class=""caption""> \n<p>The cats just can't stop hanging out in this house.</p> \n</div> \n</div> \n<h3>Do the Japanese love cats?</h3> \n<p>Who <em>doesn't</em> love cats? If the internet has taught us anything, it's that cats — standoffish and aloof, but incredibly loving on their own terms — are the perfect animal of our modern era. So of course the Japanese love cats. It's only right.</p> \n<p>More seriously, though, cute cats have always been part of Japanese pop culture. From Hello Kitty to <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUyr6Ifq2HU"">the catbus</a> in the movie <em>My Neighbor Totoro</em>, they appear in lots of great works of Japanese pop art. Japan was also the second country to open <a href=""http://time.com/2280/heres-an-inside-look-at-japans-best-cat-cafes/"">a cat cafe</a> (where customers get to hang out with felines) and is the home of <a href=""http://maruthecat.tumblr.com/"">Maru</a>, arguably the world's single greatest cat and one of the original viral video stars.</p> \n<p><iframe width=""420"" height=""315"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/xdhLQCYQ-nQ"" frameborder=""0""></iframe></p> \n<p>And remember how I mentioned that Japan celebrates an informal Cat Day? Well, Apple was only able to run the promotion that rocketed Neko Atsume into the public eye because there are <a href=""http://images.eurogamer.net/2013/articles/1/7/4/3/3/4/5/142660211488.png"">a </a><a href=""http://images.eurogamer.net/2013/articles/1/7/4/3/3/4/5/142660211488.png""><em>lot</em></a><a href=""http://images.eurogamer.net/2013/articles/1/7/4/3/3/4/5/142660211488.png""> of Japanese games starring cats</a>.</p> \n<h3>What does it all mean?</h3> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""3780346"" alt=""Neko Atsume"" src=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3780346/happycats.0.png""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Underrated in terms of this game's appeal: all of the cats are smiling all of the time. (Hit-Point)</p> \n<p>Smartphone games where little beings live inside your phone have become increasingly popular in recent years. From <a href=""http://tstoaddicts.com/"">The Simpsons: Tapped Out</a> to <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/8/4/5956179/how-did-Kim-Kardashian-become-famous"">Kim Kardashian Hollywood</a>, more and more apps host virtual worlds that carry on, whether you're looking at them or not.</p> \n<p>And that's part of Neko Atsume's appeal. Even though we know these sorts of games are heavily programmed to make it seem like they exist even when we turn off our phones, if they're done well, the illusion of their persistence becomes easier to accept. The cats in Neko Atsume don't just seem like animated sprites on a phone screen; at their most convincing (and with a little willing suspension of disbelief), they seem like <em>real cats</em> that just happen to live within your phone.</p> \n<p>Much has been written about how our phones and tablets are isolating us from actual human interaction, by creating a world where we're constantly looking at screens, even when we should be focused on what's unfolding before us in reality. But our phones can also make us feel <em>more</em> connected. Maybe that comes in the form of texting with our friends, or maybe it comes in the form of caring for virtual cats. Neko Atsume is great at constructing those feelings, even as your conscious brain is aware that the kittens you're feeding aren't real.</p> \n<h3>How do I download this game?</h3> \n<p>Neko Atsume is available for free on both <a href=""https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/nekoatsume/id923917775?mt=8"">iTunes</a> and <a href=""https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jp.co.hit_point.nekoatsume&amp;hl=en"">Google Play</a> for iOS and Android, respectively.

There would be no Amy Schumer or Fresh Off the Boat without Margaret Cho,http://www.vox.com/2015/6/14/8774459/margaret-cho-feminist-comedy,"The unsinkable comedian helped start many of pop culture's current conversations, and now she's preparing to return to the standup circuit.","<p>We weren't always ready for <a href=""http://margaretcho.com/"">Margaret Cho</a>.</p> \n<p>Sixteen years ago, Cho was using her comedy to start many of the conversations we are having today, by talking about diversity, representation, and the way we treat women. But her sharp and prescient<b> </b>commentary was relegated to the sidelines of pop culture — it was something you had to seek out.</p> \n<p><iframe frameborder=""0"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/kc6mLwOa2Ig"" height=""315"" width=""420""></iframe></p> \n<p>A survey of the television and comedy landscape today yields plenty of sterling success stories — stories that are rooted in what Cho was fighting for. Consider, for instance, TV series like <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/2/10/8008953/fresh-off-the-boat-abc""><em>Fresh Off the Boat</em></a> and <em>Black-ish</em>, or, well, anything that Amy Schumer or <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/3/18/8237713/shonda-rhimes-diversity-hrc"">Shonda Rhimes touches</a>. They all propagate messages of diversity, representation, and feminism that are as prominent in pop culture as they've ever been. Cho helped pave the way for that to happen.</p> \n<p>""We really needed that kind of comedy at the time,"" Cho told Vox. ""We just didn't have the language yet. Now we do, and it's really a great time for minorities and women in comedy. We have people that are brilliant and talking about feminism, race, and equality in an important, exciting way.""</p> \n<p>Cho's comedy is important. She continued a long tradition of female comedians — including Moms Mabley, Phyllis Diller, Joan Rivers, and Wanda Sykes, among others — who shattered the mold in terms of the type of comedy that women were ""supposed"" to perform. And on a larger scale, female comedians like Cho and the women who inspired her have blazed a trail with their sharp social and political criticism, pushing for equality one joke at a time.</p> \n<p>Things are different for Cho now. Some of battles she fought have been won. Some of her go-to targets, like George Bush and Donald Rumsfeld, are out of the spotlight. And politically, society is<strong> </strong>more in line with her vision of equality and diversity than it was 16 years ago. But that hasn't stopped Cho from pushing the envelope.</p> \n<h3>Margaret Cho's early comedy still rings true today</h3> \n<p>In 1999, Cho embarked on her ""I'm the One That I Want"" comedy tour following a tender point in her career. Five years earlier, she'd landed her own TV show on ABC called<em> </em><a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108693/""><em>All-American Girl</em></a>. It was the first primetime sitcom in the history of the medium to feature a predominantly Asian-American cast.</p> \n<p>It was also a living hell for her.</p> \n<p>And as we would learn through the standup she performed during ""I'm the One,"" network executives commented on her appearance body so frequently that Cho developed an eating disorder. She was also waging a war against ignorance and a general lack of familiarity with Asian-American faces on television — ABC even assigned an Asian consultant to Cho's show because they felt it wasn't ""Asian enough.""</p> \n<p><iframe frameborder=""0"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/dHZR9iS8a-U"" height=""315"" width=""420""></iframe></p> \n<p>""When you're on television you become a kind of community property, and people say whatever they want about you,"" Cho revealed during one standup appearance. ""And because I'm a woman, a lot of people said that I was ugly, and that I was fat,"" she continued. <strong> </strong></p> \n<p>What Cho said in 1999 still resonates. The main difference is that in 2015, Americans are more apt to acknowledge our own ignorance and failings outright. We're also more  ready to address those deficiencies through pop culture. For example, a recent episode of <em>Inside Amy Schumer</em>'s third season boldly <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/5/7/8565317/amy-schumer-jury-watch"">addressed the way we talk about women's looks</a> in a skit that expertly parodied the play <em>12 Angry Men.</em></p> \n<p> </p> \n<div style=""background-color:#000000;width:520px;""> \n<div style=""padding:4px;"">\n<iframe frameborder=""0"" height=""288"" width=""512"" src=""http://media.mtvnservices.com/embed/mgid:arc:video:comedycentral.com:c9f10dbc-fcda-436d-84d4-0b3ef8510579""></iframe> \n<p style=""text-align:left;background-color:#FFFFFF;padding:4px;margin-top:4px;margin-bottom:0px;font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:12px;"">Get More: <a href=""http://www.cc.com"">Comedy Central</a>,<a href=""http://www.cc.com/funny-videos"">Funny Videos</a>,<a href=""http://www.cc.com/shows"">Funny TV Shows</a></p> \n</div> \n</div> \n<p> </p> \n<p>""I feel like [Schumer has] taken what I've done and really expanded on that,"" Cho told me. ""She's really powerful, and I think that feminist voice is so important.""</p> \n<p>Though Schumer and Cho have touched upon some of the same topics and clearly share similar viewpoints, Schumer's comedy is markedly different from Cho's. It's less pointed, less angry, more subtle. Cho had to fight to further some ideas — like that of representation in the media — that we didn't yet have names for. Her comedy was more political, more biting. In some cases, it was almost reminiscent of motivational speeches. It was all those things because it <em>had</em> to be.</p> \n<p>""It was really great to be able to do that. And that kind of comedy was needed at the time,"" Cho told me. ""We didn't know how to talk about things like invisibility.""</p> \n<h3>What's next for Margaret Cho?</h3> \n<p>Margaret Cho loves playing men.</p> \n<p>At the 2014 Golden Globes, Cho performed a bit in which she played a North Korean character named <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/style-blog/wp/2015/01/12/was-margaret-chos-north-korea-act-biting-comedy-or-just-racist/"">Cho Yung Ja</a>. Though some people found the character <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/style-blog/wp/2015/01/12/was-margaret-chos-north-korea-act-biting-comedy-or-just-racist/"">offensive</a>, Cho Yung Ja was a timely riff — Seth Rogen and James Franco's <em>The Interview </em>and the ire it caused in North Korea was a news fixation at the time<em> — </em>on the former/current North Korean leaders Kim Jong Il and Kim Jong Un, two figures Cho had previously played on the NBC comedy <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/06/12/30-rock-tina-fey-margaret-cho-kim-jong-il_n_1590327.html""><em>30 Rock</em></a><em> </em>(for which she earned an <a href=""http://www.zap2it.com/blogs/margaret_cho_on_her_30_rock_emmy_nomination_and_why_playing_kim_jong-il_is_karma-2012-08"">Emmy nomination</a>). And in the recently released film <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3564200/""><em>Tooken</em></a>, a comedy spoof of the <em>Taken</em> franchise, she portrays another eccentric, villainous Asian man known as Brownfinger.</p> \n<p>""Brownfinger, he's an angry man and he's just pissed off at the world,"" Cho says.

And he tries to get back at everyone by wreaking havoc in people's lives.""</p> \n<p>Playing men has been a liberating experience, Cho says.</p> \n<p>""I really love playing men. I think it's letting go of having to put on makeup, and actually it's a longer process to make me into a woman than to make me into a man,"" she said. ""I just really appreciate that. It's fun to kind of challenge yourself. You're able to let go of the trappings of being an actress. It's exciting.""</p> \n<p>Cho is now in the process of<strong> </strong>recording a comedy album she plans to release this fall, as well as trying her hand at producing and working behind the camera on scripted and non-scripted TV shows that are in the nascent stages of development. All of these projects tie into Cho's upcoming <a href=""http://margaretcho.com/2015/05/11/fall-tour-announcement-the-psycho-tour/"">""PsyCHO"" comedy tour</a>, which launches in October.</p> \n<p>Cho says she was inspired to return to the standup circuit because while she's worked hard to start meaningful conversations about plenty of social issues, there are still many that she feels strongly about, many to be angry about. The point of the ""PsyCHO"" tour is to channel that anger and use it for good.</p> \n<p>""There's so much violence against people of color, women, and the LGBT community — 'PsyCHO' talks about the right to anger,"" Cho says. ""We have a right to that anger, and we can harness it and use it to benefit ourselves.""</p>",Music

"I love comic books, but I hate Comic-Con",http://www.vox.com/2015/7/10/8929505/why-comic-con-sucks,"San Diego Comic-Con and New York Comic Con have gotten too big, and failed their fans.","<p><em>When I refer to Comic Con in this post, I'm referring to New York Comic Con and San Diego Comic-Con, the two biggest comic book conventions in America.</em></p> \n<p><a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/10/9/6949881/san-diego-comic-con"">San Diego Comic-Con</a> is upon us, and my thoughts are with those brave, tenacious souls who've traveled to Southern California to attend — the next three days will be hell for them.</p> \n<p>Each year, New York Comic Con and San Diego Comic-Con welcome more than 100,000 comic and pop culture fans through their gates. By the time they arrive (possibly in elaborate costumes), these folks have already been through a lot: They've navigated faulty electronic ticketing systems, they may have overpaid scalpers after convention passes sold out within minutes, they've entered lotteries to book hotel rooms, they've taken vacation time at work, and they've spent hours strategizing over which panels to check out and how to actually get into them.</p> \n<p>But they still haven't gotten to the worst part — the endless waiting and the oppressive number of tired, irritable people doing the same exact thing.</p> \n<p><a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/10/9/6949881/san-diego-comic-con"">San Diego and New York's comic conventions</a> are mutant amalgams that combine the misery of standing in line to get off an airplane with the sensory overload of an amusement park. They are often logistical nightmares, so much so that I've personally witnessed multiple people experience meltdowns as a result. And yet more and more people go to them each year.</p> \n<p>Comic book and pop culture fans are good people. They're all searching for that one moment when their fidelity to the characters and franchises they love will finally be rewarded, and they will go through hell to find it. And they deserve better than what these conventions are giving.</p> \n<h3>San Diego Comic-Con and New York Comic Con have grown too big, and the fans have nothing to show for it.</h3> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""3862426"">\n<img src=""https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3862426/Screen_Shot_2014-10-09_at_7.18.35_AM.0%20(1).png""> \n<div class=""caption""> \n<p>A note on the graph: San Diego Comic-Con reports its attendance as <a href=""http://www.nerdist.com/2014/07/san-diego-comic-con-by-the-numbers/"">""130,000+""</a> while New York Comic Con rounds to the thousands. We plugged in 130,000 as San Diego Comic-Con's numbers. New York Comic Con considers itself the <a href=""http://www.newyorkcomiccon.com/About/NYCC-Fan-FAQs/"">""second-largest comic book and pop culture event in the country.""</a></p> \n</div> \n</div> \n<p>The main issue with SDCC and NYCC is that they are enormous. In 2014, New York Comic Con attracted more than <a href=""http://sdccblog.com/2014/10/by-the-numbers-new-york-comic-con-probably-isnt-bigger-than-san-diego-comic-con/"">151,000 attendees</a> over its four-day span. San Diego Comic-Con attracted around <a href=""http://sdccblog.com/2014/10/by-the-numbers-new-york-comic-con-probably-isnt-bigger-than-san-diego-comic-con/"">133,000 attendees</a>. Both conventions are so huge that a strange, tedious contest has sprung up between the two in the way tickets are tracked and sold, so that one can have <a href=""http://sdccblog.com/2014/10/by-the-numbers-new-york-comic-con-probably-isnt-bigger-than-san-diego-comic-con/"">bragging rights</a> as the bigger convention.</p> \n<p>Larger conventions attract more attention from influential companies like Marvel and DC, as well as movie studios such as Lionsgate, Fox, and Sony. Marketers who work for these companies want to get their movies and TV shows in front of as many eyeballs as possible to build hype. Being a giant convention makes it much easier to land that exclusive <em>Hunger Games </em>trailer and cast visit, which in turn will help ensure that more people want attend your event next year. Once the beast has been fed, the cycle is complete.</p> \n<p>The main problem with a convention that keeps growing is that almost none of the obvious benefits actually make the experience better for attendees. Even though ticket prices have increased, and the companies running these conventions are making more money than ever, they haven't implemented any significant improvements for fans.</p> \n<p>The facilities are largely the same as they were in the beginning, even as attendance has increased, so the lines have only gotten longer (SDCC, for example, is committed to the city and its convention center <a href=""http://deadline.com/2015/07/comic-con-staying-san-diego-through-2018-1201467337/"">through 2018</a>). The food at NYCC, save for food trucks, is bad enough to make you consider a hunger strike. The state of the bathrooms at the end of the weekend will make you lose faith in society. And the crush of humanity on the exhibition floors is exhausting.</p> \n<p>At the beginning of each convention, attendees are spry, happy to be there. But if you were to follow one person for the entire weekend, you'd likely see her spirit begin to crumble as she dealt with the onslaught.</p> \n<h3>I probably wouldn't be able to get into Comic Con if I weren't covering it for work</h3> \n<p><iframe width=""420"" height=""315"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/VWMR1ReDvZ8"" frameborder=""0""></iframe></p> \n<p>For the past few years, SDCC and NYCC passes have sold out in minutes, but many of them aren't going straight to fans. Big blocks of tickets ultimately wind up in the hands of scalpers and resellers who target big events and the people who are willing to pay a premium to get in.</p> \n<p>At New York Comic Con, there's an extensive application to get a press pass. It requires you to provide circulation numbers, past articles you've written, and articles about NYCC and comic books you've written in the past. Considering the hundreds of thousands of fans who tried to get tickets and how many were denied, a press pass is probably the only way I could get into the convention.</p> \n<p>""The fact is that tickets for New York Comic Con are more popular than ever and we regret that because of that demand some of our most loyal fans are not getting tickets,"" Lance Fensterman, the spokesperson for Reed Exhibitions (the company that runs NYCC), told the site <a href=""http://www.bleedingcool.com/2014/06/27/new-york-comic-con-sells-out-3-day-passes-as-scalpers-come-to-town/"">Bleeding Cool in 2014</a>, explaining that his team was trying to think of ways to better serve the fans.</p> \n<p>""We too are frustrated by the reselling of tickets at the inflated price [of the tickets sold by resellers]. EBay has informed us there is nothing they can do about it,"" he added.</p> \n<p>In 2015, the rising demand of tickets along with resellers and scalpers once again hit NYCC, leaving lots of fans out in the dust.</p> \n<p>""What can you do about those reselling tickets at inflated prices? DON’T BUY THEM!"" <a href=""http://www.bleedingcool.com/2015/05/15/nycc-apologises-for-ticket-sales-foul-up-and-that-scalper-tickets-will-be-voided/"">Fensterman wrote to fans</a>. ""The demand for tickets at noon was roughly quadruple what we experienced in 2014. Those who were attempting to buy tickets in the queue know that it took several hours to move through the queue and received error messages along the way.""</p> \n<p>SDCC has a more complicated ticketing system that helps to weed out scalpers. But it has faced <a href=""http://comicbook.com/2015/02/21/san-diego-comic-con-2015-sells-out-in-an-hour/"">similar complaints</a> about system failure for the past few years. The bottom line: A lot of loyal fans are being shut out, and there's an abundance of futility in trying to accommodate them. Expecting a miracle is unrealistic, but it seems the system has gotten worse, not better.</p> \n<h3>You have to choose between comic books and your favorite movie franchises and television shows</h3> \n<p>One of the biggest letdowns for the fans who do manage to get into the big conventions is not being able to secure entry to the panels they want to see, and being forced to choose.</p> \n<p>Back in 2013, I attended NYCC (where members of the press wait in line like everyone else) and patiently got in line at 9:30 am in hopes of seeing <a href=""http://www.ew.com/article/2013/10/13/the-walking-dead-panel-new-york-comic-con"">the panel for </a><a href=""http://www.ew.com/article/2013/10/13/the-walking-dead-panel-new-york-comic-con""><em>The Walking Dead</em></a> in the afternoon. <em>The Walking Dead</em> was scheduled for 5 pm — this was the first time I'd ever attempted to attend a ""big"" panel — and I waited almost two hours to get into the room it was being held in. Then I sat through a day's worth of other panels to keep my spot. I left shortly after it concluded, and there was still a massive line, way bigger than the one I'd waited in, to get in.</p> \n<p>Since 2013, the lines have only gotten longer.</p> \n<p>I'm not sure how long some of those people stood in line, but I wonder how much of their time at NYCC was spent waiting. I also wonder how many other panels they <em>didn't</em> get to see as a result.</p> \n<p>Because NYCC and SDCC are so crowded, attendees are forced to choose between events for their favorite TV shows, comic books, and movies. No matter what, you're going to miss out on <em>something</em> — if schedules didn't overlap, the conventions would be two weeks long — but it's a shame that people have to spend hours and hours waiting in line for the most popular panels when they could be enjoying smaller ones. The comic book panels are usually great, but if you want to see them, there's no way you'll be able to also see some of buzzier TV and movie panels. I'm not sure there's a way to alleviate this. Going to smaller conventions for comic book panels and saving SDCC and NYCC for big movie stuff might be the most feasible option.</p> \n<h3>Is anyone listening?</h3> \n<p>At the end of most comic conventions there's an event called a <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/7/28/5943889/comic-con-day-four-talk-back-sdcc-2014"">Talk Back</a>, where people voice their concerns to the convention's higher-ups. At SDCC, <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/7/28/5943889/comic-con-day-four-talk-back-sdcc-2014"">attendees speak to John Rogers</a>, the president of the convention. Many typical complaints revolve around the overcrowding situation, but they also address concerns like the lack of attention and service given to disabled attendees, or a lax sexual harassment policy. The complaints are usually answered with a promise to be better next year.</p> \n<p>But the fans who attend the Talk Back are there for something more.</p> \n<p>As my colleague <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/7/28/5943889/comic-con-day-four-talk-back-sdcc-2014"">Todd VanDerWerff wrote</a> after attending SDCC's Talk Back in 2014:</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>There's just no way to go back to the way things were, not exactly. The Talk Back is wonderful and raucous and, oddly, intentionally funny. But it also suggests the frustration that arises when something you love, something you've devoted a part of your life to, is simply becoming something else. Comic-Con is an institution now. It can do pretty much whatever it likes. Yet for many who attend it, it's a kind of Brigadoon, a magical, lost city they can see disappearing into the mists all around them.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Fans' complaints, and this criticism, come from a place of fear — the fear that something so great is going to disappear. Attending comic conventions has introduced me to new comic books, creators, artists, and people I wouldn't have found otherwise. The experience has made me appreciate comic books and approach them in ways I hadn't previously thought of. And so it makes me anxious that the possibility of having that experience might one day disappear because the people who run NYCC and SDCC aren't on the same page as the fans who attend their events.</p> \n<p>If their ultimate vision is anything like what we've seen in the past five or so years, it's one with eyes on becoming the biggest comic conventions on the planet — something that doesn't have true fans' best interests in mind.</p>",Music

What Taylor Swift taught a 39-year-old ex-jock,http://www.vox.com/2015/7/15/8970541/taylor-swift-taught-jock,The All-Star Game had nothing on this incredibly talented pop star.,"<p>I should have been watching the Major League Baseball All-Star Game on Tuesday night.</p> \n<p>I'm a former college baseball player. I've attended two Midsummer Classics — Camden Yards in '93 and Fenway Park in '99. I even went to a major league stadium on Tuesday night: Nationals Park in Washington, DC. And if you follow pop music the way I follow baseball, you just discovered my secret.</p> \n<p>I charged a Taylor Swift ticket to my <a href=""http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Man+Card"">man card</a>. And it was worth it.</p> \n<p>She's a class act who puts on a great show and manages to deliver messages about self-worth and self-empowerment while touching on universal struggles that anyone can relate to, no matter their demographic. Yeah, I'm proud to call myself a Taylor Swift fan.</p> \n<h3>""Don't say I didn't, say I didn't warn ya'""</h3> \n<p>I should start at the beginning.</p> \n<p>My wife was a little surprised last winter when I called to say I was planning to buy four seats to see T-Swift, or TS, or Shifty Swifty, or whatever the kids are calling her these days. We've been together for a dozen years and had never been to a major concert together. The last act we'd seen as a couple was <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-ij_iTQt2w"">Gordon Lightfoot</a>.</p> \n<p>At first, I lied to her — and to myself. I had priority access to buy the tickets because I'm a Washington Nationals season ticket holder, and I reasoned that it only made sense to take advantage of the opportunity. Surely we could hock them at a profit, I told Stephanie. Or perhaps sell them to friends at face value.</p> \n<p>Worst-case scenario, I said, we'd just go with another couple and chalk it up in the ""new experience"" column. Stephanie was all in for the Taylor tickets, and I suspect she knew something that I wasn't fully ready to admit to myself: I wanted to go.</p> \n<h3>""What you're looking for has been here the whole time""</h3> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""3875546"">\n<img src=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3875546/Taylor1.JPG""> \n<div class=""caption""> \n<p>Taylor Swift performs at Nationals Park in Washington, DC, July 14, 2015.</p> \n</div> \n</div> \n<p>The recurring device of Swift's big hit songs is a character who is shunned, and whose love is often unrequited, because of her perceived flaws. Usually the character ends up comfortable in her own skin, whether or not she gains the acceptance she seeks. This theme isn't unique to Swift; it's a staple of music, literature, and film. There might even be a Gregorian chant along these lines.</p> \n<p>I think the main reason I like Swift's lyrics is that I find her characters so easy to identify with. That may sound strange because she's usually writing about women, or at least from the perspective of a woman. But her characters' struggles are universal, and she's vivid in her descriptions. The contrasts between <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuNIsY6JdUw"">high heels and sneakers, or a cheerleader and a fan</a>, are evocative.</p> \n<p>I can remember, back in high school, wondering why a certain girl was head over heels for another guy when I thought — and prayed — we'd make a better match. I suspect most adults have similar experiences and now smile at the memory of what was once so painful because it has been overcome, because they've grown more comfortable with themselves.</p> \n<p>In the music video for ""You Belong With Me,"" Swift is looking in the mirror when she sings, ""What you're looking for has been here the whole time.""</p> \n<p><iframe width=""560"" height=""315"" frameborder=""0"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/VuNIsY6JdUw""></iframe></p> \n<p>Don't get me wrong: I don't want to ascribe some super-deep meaning to pop songs. Just the opposite. Swift is an effective messenger because what she's saying is simple, straightforward, and inclusive. That gives her a lot of influence, particularly with girls and young women, and she should be applauded for reinforcing positive messages about self-worth.</p> \n<h3>""On the outside looking in""</h3> \n<p>I already mentioned that I felt a little dent in my man card when I bought the tickets. As the date of the show approached, I became a little more apprehensive about what going to a Taylor Swift show said about me. That's all tied up in the politics of masculinity. Guys spend a lot of time trying to out-macho each other, and one way in which they do so is to challenge each other's manliness.</p> \n<p>For example, I played American Legion baseball with a guy who, every time one of his teammates failed on the field, would shout at the top of his lungs, ""Lift your skirt, Alice."" None of them was named Alice, and all of them were on <i>his team</i>. Thankfully, this behavior stopped abruptly when he struck out one day and was greeted by a chorus of ""Lift your skirt"" from the mothers of his fellow players.</p> \n<p>I suspected I would take some gentle ribbing from my friends for volunteering to go to teenybopper land to hear a pop diva, and I did. Usually just a smirk or a raised eyebrow. When I tweeted a picture of the stage Tuesday night, one of my friends tweeted at me, ""Taylor Swift &gt; all star game?"" None of it was ugly. We're all adults. But the risk that testosterone levels will permanently drop upon entrance to a Taylor Swift show is as commonly understood among many men of my demographic as it is untrue. Though I did notice that when I went to a restroom equipped to handle about 40 men at a time, only three were there. At the same time, lines for the women's bathrooms spilled out onto the concourse.</p> \n<p>There were other signs that Stephanie and I — who were joined by Stephanie's friend Erika and my sister, Amanda — were a little out of place heading into the concert. For starters, when I picked up Steph at home, she was wearing a Diane von Furstenberg dress. I guess DVF will ""never go out of style"" — but to a ballpark for a pop concert? We had dinner at a nice Italian restaurant near the stadium, like good little yuppies. Before the show started, Stephanie and Erika started talking about leaving early. And the merchandise stands didn't have any T-shirts in my size.</p> \n<h3>""A place in this world""</h3> \n<p>I haven't seen a lot of live musical acts, but I can say I've never seen anyone — not the Dead, not U2, not the Who, and not Lenny Kravitz (all of whom are great at crowd interaction) — put as much energy into wrapping the audience into the show as Taylor Swift did.</p> \n<p>There were threats of severe thundershowers. Swift came out on stage almost an hour earlier than we expected, having asked her warmup acts to truncate their performances to try to get in the show before the rains. One fun wrinkle on this tour is that she keeps bringing out other stars to sing their top hits. We got to see Jason Derulo perform ""Want to Want Me.""</p> \n<p>For ""You Belong With Me,"" she grabbed a guitar and made her way out to the end of an enormous plank that ran deep into the crowd, playing and singing without accompaniment. She knew how to emphasize a top hit by letting the crowd join her in singing.</p> \n<p>She played for two hours without any real lull. I didn't care for the interludes when she spoke to the crowd about self-worth, but, as I noted above, I see the value in them. And she ended on an electric note, punctuated with fireworks, by singing ""Shake It Off"" as her encore.</p> \n<p>By the end of the concert, this 39-year-old ex-jock felt pretty included. So, as I think about the All-Star Game I missed, and the potential humiliation of calling myself a Taylor Swift fan, this is what I've concluded: ""The players gonna play, play, play, play, play and the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate (haters gonna hate). I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake. I shake it off.""</p> \n<p>And when I attend the 2018 All-Star Game at Nationals Park, I'll have a fond memory of the Taylor Swift show I saw there.</p> \n<hr> \n<!--  ########  BEGIN VOLUME VIDEO  ########  --> \n<div class=""volume-video"" id=""volume-placement-6035"" data-volume-placement=""article"" data-analytics-placement=""entry:middle"" data-volume-id=""1097"" data-volume-uuid=""101e69d0b"" data-analytics-label=""The anatomy of Taylor Swift’s new “Style”  | 1097"" data-analytics-action=""volume:view:entry:middle"" data-analytics-viewport=""video""></div> \n<!--  ########  END VOLUME VIDEO  ########  -->",Music

Clueless turns 20: 6 way existential lessons it taught us,http://www.vox.com/2015/7/23/9016543/clueless-20th-anniversary,"Twenty years ago this week, a little film named Clueless hit theaters and changed pop culture forever.","<p>Twenty years ago this week, a little film named <em>Clueless</em> hit theaters and changed pop culture forever. With its canny mix of sharp writing, timeless themes, and borderline surrealist fashion, even today the movie feels wholly fresh and original (try as some might to <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-zpOMYRi0w"">capture its vibe</a>). But don't write off <i>Clueless</i> as just another teen movie. For members of a generation who watched it during their formative years (and then rewound it and watched again and again), the seemingly flighty comedy revealed some way existential truths.</p> \n<p>So in celebration of its 20th birthday, here are six lessons to learn from <em>Clueless</em>.</p> \n<h3>1) Sincerity can be a boon, not something to be looked down on</h3> \n<p><iframe class=""giphy-embed"" style=""max-width: 100%"" frameborder=""0"" height=""274"" width=""480"" src=""//giphy.com/embed/137ABMVVASXWdG""></iframe></p> \n<p>The '80s and '90s were a prime era for great teen movies, and <em>Clueless</em> is often lumped in with 1988's sharp satire <em>Heathers</em>, which shares a focus (popular high school girls) and certain elements (hyper-stylized dialogue and costumes) but in tone is the pitch-black yin to <em>Clueless</em>'s sunny yang.</p> \n<p>And tone is really what sets <em>Clueless</em> apart from so many other teen movies. It's plenty funny, and it's not afraid to wink at its characters' occasional lack of perspective. (The movie's harshest insult, after all, is ""You're a virgin who can't drive."") Yet the film's overall tone is one of sweetness. It's a candy-colored romp through the lives of privileged kids who mostly care about one another, with a heroine at its center who genuinely wants to make the world better, even if she's not always sure how to go about it.</p> \n<p>As <em>Clueless</em> writer-director Amy Heckerling says in Jen Chaney's <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/As-If-History-Clueless-Heckerling/dp/1476799083/ref=asap_bc?ie=UTF8"">oral history</a> of the film, part of what attracted her to the story was the sunny nature of its lead: ""I remember reading <em>Emma</em> [the Jane Austen book the film is loosely based on]<strong> </strong>and <em>Gentlemen Prefer Blondes</em>. Those characters: what I gravitated to was how positive they could be.""</p> \n<p>She elaborated to the <a href=""http://www.telegraph.co.uk/film/clueless/making-of-cast-interviews-anniversary/"">Telegraph</a>:</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>I had always been interested in a character who is extremely optimistic, and what it would be like to be the kind of person who didn’t have any self-doubt. So I wrote Fox a pilot about this very happy character, Cher, and they didn’t want to do it.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Alicia Silverstone, who played main character Cher, <a href=""http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2015/06/clueless-oral-history-20-anniversary"">also praised</a> that aspect of her character to Chaney, saying she ""loved how seriously she took everything. ... She was so sincere and so serious. And that's what I think makes her so ridiculous and lovely all the time.""</p> \n<h3>2) Comedies starring women can do gangbusters at the box office</h3> \n<p>Already, 2015 has seen several high-profile and hugely lucrative comedies starring, written by, and directed by women — Elizabeth Banks's directorial debut <em>Pitch Perfect 2</em> raked in more than <a href=""http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=pitchperfect2.htm"">$180 million</a> domestically, and Amy Schumer's <em>Trainwreck</em> gave director Judd Apatow his second-best opening ever. But studios continue to balk at women-led films (see: the <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/05/05/sony-emails-female-superhero-movies_n_7212386.html"">leaked Sony emails</a> about why female superhero movies are a terrible idea for a particularly potent example).</p> \n<p><iframe src=""//giphy.com/embed/pUB3d8iV8Jt8A"" width=""480"" height=""293"" frameborder=""0"" style=""max-width: 100%"" class=""giphy-embed""></iframe></p> \n<p>Heckerling struggled with the same problem. As she told the <a href=""http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1995-07-25/features/1995206141_1_amy-heckerling-clueless-cher-horowitz"">Baltimore Sun</a> after <em>Clueless</em> came out, studio executives were ""worried about something that was so female-oriented."" She said the studio ""kept pressuring me to create more of a life for the boys in the film, to create more of an ensemble piece, which didn't make sense to me at all.""</p> \n<p>The idea for <em>Clueless</em> went through several iterations, beginning as a TV series, then getting turned into a feature film at the advice of Heckerling's agent, Ken Stovitz, then getting rejected ""so many times it was a joke,"" according to Stovitz.</p> \n<p>Luckily, like Cher arguing her way to a better report card, Heckerling and Stovitz persisted — and finally got their screenplay picked up after big-time producer <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0748784/"">Scott Rudin</a> gave it his stamp of approval. On a $12 million budget, the movie went on to gross more than $56 million domestically, inspire a three-season <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0115137/"">TV show</a>, and occupy a permanent place on home video and in the pop cultural canon.</p> \n<h3>3) A film can have a diverse cast without turning into an after-school special</h3> \n<p><iframe src=""//giphy.com/embed/PdTDTyNoy5LNK"" width=""480"" height=""270"" frameborder=""0"" style=""max-width: 100%"" class=""giphy-embed""></iframe></p> \n<p>The cast of <em>Clueless</em> is arguably more diverse than the casts of many films made today, without feeling like a commercial for a <a href=""https://vimeo.com/58739937"">very special yogurt</a>. Sure, Dionne (Stacey Dash) could technically be considered an example of the <a href=""http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackBestFriend"">""black best friend""</a> trope, but she gets her own plot lines and character quirks wholly outside of Cher.</p> \n<p>As Grantland's Molly Lambert <a href=""http://grantland.com/hollywood-prospectus/as-if-a-journey-through-the-los-angeles-of-clueless/"">wrote</a>:</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>It wasn’t until later that I realized how unusual it was to see black teenagers onscreen at all, let alone rich ones. Since so many movies, particularly movies set in a fictionalized dystopian Los Angeles, enforce the idea that <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0375679/"">diversity leads to conflict</a>, it’s still refreshing to see a movie like <em>Clueless </em>suggesting that racial diversity in social settings like high school leads to the normalization of that diversity. The students at Bronson Alcott are extremely wealthy, but in <em>Clueless</em>’s L.A., that wealth knows no color boundary.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Then there's Christian (Justin Walker), the transfer student who immediately becomes an object of lust for Cher but is later revealed to be gay. His sexuality, though it drives some of the plot, is not the sole defining quality of his character — and the movie refreshingly frames it through Cher’s ""bonehead"" slow realization rather than any need for a dramatic coming-out monologue. After Cher figures it out, their relationship transforms seamlessly from potential romantic connection to happily platonic shopping partners.</p> \n<p>This put <em>Clueless</em> among the ranks of several mid- and late-'90s movies and television shows that helped to normalize and deepen portrayals of LGBTQ characters, coming out (no pun intended) on the heels of MTV's <em>The Real World</em> season three, which featured out and HIV-positive <a href=""http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/06/01/pedro-zamora-a-hero-in-the-real-world.html"">Pedro Zamora</a>, and paving the way for later shows like <em>Ellen</em> and <em>Will &amp; Grace</em>.</p> \n<h3>4) There's nothing like a little Hollywood gloss to make the classics more palatable</h3> \n<p><iframe width=""560"" height=""315"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/oLEdZb4PkGM"" frameborder=""0""></iframe></p> \n<p>Plenty of people in <em>Clueless</em> deride Cher for being an airhead, but she proves time and again that she has her own brand of pop culture–inflected smarts. In an especially satisfying scene, she corrects Josh’s pretentious girlfriend who misquotes <em>Hamlet</em>, citing her (accurate) memory of the Mel Gibson–starring movie version.</p> \n<p>It’s a needed win for Cher, who's in a low patch at the time, but it's also a good reminder of <em>Clueless</em>'s underpinnings as a modernized riff on Jane Austen's <em>Emma</em>. The movie’s target audience might not have spent weekends poring over the pages of 19th-century mannered comedies, but <em>Clueless</em> slapped a plaid skirt and a ‘90s sensibility on Austen's pointed societal commentary and made it appealing to new and younger generations. Heckerling's strategy paved the way for more teen-centric updates of classics both great (<em><a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0147800/?ref_=nv_sr_1"">10 Things I Hate About You</a></em><em>, </em><a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0139134/""><em>Cruel Intentions</em></a>) and not so much (the less said about <em><a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0184791/"">O</a></em><em> </em>and<em> </em><em><a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0454945/?ref_=nv_sr_2"">She's the Man</a></em>, the better).</p> \n<h3>5) Teenagers are practically their own species</h3> \n<p>I was a few years away from being a teenager in 1995, and, thus, many of the references in <em>Clueless</em> went completely over my head the first time I watched it. But the thing that stuck with me and that makes the movie resonate even now is the feeling of awe at what seemed like a new type of human being springing into brilliantly colored life on screen. These people had their own cars, their own cellphones (before that was really a thing), their own language even.</p> \n<p>But what felt the most groundbreaking about <em>Clueless</em> was that it treated its characters' triumphs and woes with respect, as worthy issues to consider, even though they weren't saving the <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/6/9/8752845/mockingjay-part2-trailer-official"">dregs of humanity</a> from an oppressive government. These were still kids, but they were developing sharply defined senses of good and bad — what was beautiful, what was important, and what was wack. <em>Clueless</em> offered me my first inkling that someday, I might grow up to be a fully formed person, instead of constantly feeling like an awkward child utterly dependent on others.</p> \n<p><iframe src=""//giphy.com/embed/peX1Nu2mLiuuA"" width=""480"" height=""264"" frameborder=""0"" style=""max-width: 100%"" class=""giphy-embed""></iframe></p> \n<p>Perhaps even more shocking to me was the idea that someone as beautiful and self-assured as Cher had moments of feeling ""wretched,"" of thinking everything she did and said was wrong. As a painfully shy Canadian transplanted to suburban Texas and struggling to fit into my new world, Cher's struggles felt like a real epiphany.</p> \n<p>These days what I remember of adolescence is the horrible things that happen to everyone’s bodies and personalities seemingly simultaneously — but watching <em>Clueless</em> reminds me of that fascinating, once-in-a-lifetime rush of self-discovery, of feeling out the edges of yourself and finding, to your surprise, that there actually <em>were</em> edges, delightful in their newness and uniqueness.</p> \n<h3>6) ""Sporadic"" means once in a while</h3> \n<p>I’ve never had to look it up since. Thanks, <em>Clueless</em>!</p> \n<p><i>If you don't feel like dusting off your VHS tape,</i> Clueless <i>is available to stream on Netflix. </i></p>",Music
"The Kardashians, explained",http://www.vox.com/2015/7/28/9060683/kardashians-explainer,They're anything but stupid.,"<p>There was a time when we didn't know who Kim Kardashian was, nor did we care about the Jenners. Lindsay Lohan was still a <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0377092/"">Mean Girl</a>, Tobey Maguire was still Spider-Man, people were still listening to Evanescence, and we were saying goodbye to <em>Friends</em>. Eleven years later, Kim Kardashian and her family are bigger than those pop culture relics.</p> \n<p>The Kardashians are one of the most famous — and most hated — families in the world. Knowledge of them transcends age, class, and race. They're on television, they're in music videos, they're in fashion campaigns — everything the light touches, so do the Kardashians. I'd wager that more people would be able to name any single Kardashian (Kim, Kourtney, Khloé, Rob) than could name the UN Secretary General (Ban Ki-moon).</p> \n<p>Yet their significance remains a mystery to many.</p> \n<p>The Kardashians are a riches-to-even-richer story, all predicated on the idea that you can turn absolutely nothing into an industry. There are better models, better moms, better sisters, and better celebrities than the Kardashians. Tracing their indomitable appeal to a place of perfection would be a lie.</p> \n<p>But the key to the Kardashians has been an element of owned and measured imperfection — the idea that all you need to do to become somebody is to unashamedly live your life for the cameras, ridiculous parts and all.</p> \n<h3>Who are the Kardashians?</h3> \n<p>The only thing you need to know — and you probably already do — is that the Kardashians are everywhere. It's quite a feat to be everywhere, on every television show and seemingly every magazine cover, when there are basically only four Kardashians devoted to the ultimate goal — the sweet intersection of massive fame, massive wealth, and/or world domination.</p> \n<p>Everywhere is, of course, huge, and four is, of course, not that many. It's a testament to how relentless the Kardashians are at plunging themselves into cultural conversations and how relentless American culture is that so many of us cannot get enough of the Kardashians.</p> \n<p>When people talk about the Kardashians, they're talking about the stars of E's reality show <a href=""http://www.eonline.com/shows/kardashians""><em>Keeping Up With the Kardashians</em></a><em> </em>(<em>KUWTK</em>), which debuted in 2007 and most recently finished its 10th season. The close-knit Kardashian family is led by matriarch Kris Jenner (née Houghton and formerly Kardashian). It consists of sisters (in order of age), Kourtney, Kim, and Khloé, and brother Rob. In later seasons, the Kardashians' half-sisters Kendall Jenner (a supermodel) and Kylie Jenner, as well as stepbrother Brody Jenner (previously on the reality show <em>The Hills</em>) gained more prominence on the show. Caitlyn Jenner, then known as Bruce, was also on the show as the family's low-key father.</p> \n<p>The<a href=""http://pagesix.com/2015/02/26/kardashians-sign-massive-100-million-deal-with-e/""> multi-year deal</a> the Kardashians have brokered with E (rumored to be worth <a href=""http://pagesix.com/2015/02/26/kardashians-sign-massive-100-million-deal-with-e/"">$100 million</a>) to appear on <em>KUWTK</em> is known as the <a href=""http://pagesix.com/2015/02/26/kardashians-sign-massive-100-million-deal-with-e/"">most expensive in reality television show history</a>. Their societal contributions range from the reality show, modeling, and a retail store to spinoffs shows, a highly addictive and profitable iPhone game, and an extremely powerful infant named North West.</p> \n<h3>How did the Kardashians get famous?</h3> \n<p>If the Kardashians were a house in <em>Game of Thrones</em>, their motto would be ""Family is our business.""</p> \n<p>The Kardashians' road to fame was paved by several rounds of nepotism and a very rich father. It all begins with <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/03/us/robert-kardashian-a-lawyer-for-o-j-simpson-dies-at-59.html"">Robert Kardashian</a>, who was famous for being on football player <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/03/us/robert-kardashian-a-lawyer-for-o-j-simpson-dies-at-59.html"">O. J. Simpson's legal defense team</a>, known in some circles as the ""Dream Team."" Dream Team, of course, usually refers to the 1992 USA Olympic basketball team, which assembled the best players in the US to gut-stomp the rest of the world. Simpson's legal dream team was like that, but instead of winning a gold medal, the attorneys successfully convinced a jury that the alleged murderer was not guilty of killing his ex-wife, in what was dubbed the ""trial of the century.""</p> \n<p>Now, because Robert Kardashian was a rich father with rich and famous friends, it allowed his offspring to have equally rich and famous friends. And that's exactly what happened with his daughter, Kim, and Hilton Hotels scion Paris Hilton.</p> \n<p>We didn't know it at the time, but Paris was the first Kim Kardashian, a cruder prototype of the pop culture behemoth that we know today.</p> \n<p>Leading up to 2003, when Paris got her reality show <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0362153/""><em>The Simple Life</em></a>, Paris and her sister, Nicky, were constant tabloid fodder. Magazines were obsessed with their parties, appearances, and friends. Kim was part of Hilton's entourage and doubled as <a href=""http://www.buzzfeed.com/briangalindo/8-times-paris-hilton-made-kim-kardashian-feel-like-crap"">Paris's personal assistant and closet organizer</a>.</p> \n<p>Like the trucker hat, Paris reached her peak in 2004 — thanks in large part <a href=""http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-3022383/Paris-Hilton-talks-inspired-Kim-Kardashian-s-meteoric-rise-fame-reality-TV-success.html"">to a sex tape</a> that was illegally circulated, then officially released. She would never achieve that same level of fame again.</p> \n<p>Like Paris, <a href=""http://hollywoodlife.com/pics/kim-kardashian-sex-tape-wealth-earnings-fortune-kris-jenner-keeping-up-with-thw-kardashians-hollywood-reporter/"">Kim had a sex tape that was circulated in 2006</a>. Her co-star and boyfriend was Ray J, brother of R&amp;B singer Brandy. But unlike Paris, she and her family managed to parlay that into even more fame — a reality television show with the backing of human can of pomade turned <i>American Idol</i> host<strong> </strong>Ryan Seacrest. Kris Jenner, the matriarch of the Kardashian family and executive producer of <em>KUWTK</em>, is the genius who pitched Seacrest the show and is the motor behind the Kardashian machine.</p> \n<p>In May 2015, <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/10/magazine/where-would-the-kardashians-be-without-kris-jenner.html?_r=0"">the New York Times Magazine wrote</a> a powerful piece praising Kris's business acumen:</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>Without Kris, Kim might not have pulled in a reported $28 million in 2014. Kendall wouldn’t necessarily be an in-demand model, walking runways for Chanel and Marc Jacobs and appearing on the covers of Allure and Harper’s Bazaar. There would most likely be no Kim Kardashian: Hollywood, a choose your own adventure (presuming it’s an adventure Kim Kardashian would go on) game app, starring Kim, that brought in many millions last year, or T-Mobile commercial, or book of selfies (<em>Selfish</em>), released this month. Kourtney and Khloé and Kim might not have three retail stores, named Dash, in Los Angeles, New York and Miami; a hair-and-makeup line, Kardashian Beauty; a bronzer line, Kardashian Glow; and Kardashian Kids, a children’s clothing line sold at Babies ""R"" Us and Nordstrom. Kendall and Kylie might not have licensing deals with PacSun, Steve Madden, Topshop and Sugar Factory, where they each have signature lollipops and several contractual agreements to appear at the candy stores.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>The show benefited from prior reality shows like <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0306370/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1""><i>The Osbournes</i></a>, <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0426738/?ref_=nv_sr_1""><i>Laguna Beach</i></a>, and <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0380934/?ref_=fn_al_tt_2""><i>Newlyweds: Nick and Jessica</i></a><em>.</em> In particular, <em>The Osbournes</em> and <em>Newlyweds</em> carved out a new niche of reality that didn't involve competition, but instead spent time on the banality, humor, and banal humor of celebrity family life (respectively, the family of rock musician Ozzy Osbourne and married pop stars Nick Lachey and Jessica Simpson). Those shows weren't afraid to cannibalize their subjects, showing them being dumb or shallow.</p> \n<p><em>KUWTK</em> does the same. There are several moments where the show hits a sweet spot between brattiness, vapidness, and melodrama. There are also endless moments where the sisters discuss things like <a href=""http://hollywoodlife.com/2010/12/03/kim-kardashian-kourtney-khloe-mayonnaise-vagina/"">vaginal maintenance trends</a>:</p> \n<p><iframe width=""420"" height=""315"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/AlzmUVCeDAQ"" frameborder=""0""></iframe></p> \n<p>But what the Kardashians have done better than any celebrity reality show stars before them is show that they're in on the $100 million joke.</p> \n<h3>But really, who are the Kardashians?</h3> \n<p>Here's the thing about the Kardashians: They're whomever we see on screen.</p> \n<p>Over the years, the Kardashian sisters have carved out personalities for themselves that are akin to the three bears in Goldilocks — but, like, infinitely richer, with much nicer houses.</p> \n<p>Kourtney, of late, has become the stern sister. Khloé, the youngest, is the ""funny"" one. Kim, Mrs. Kanye West, is somewhere in the middle. Kendall, their half-sister, is known for her modeling career, while Kylie, their other half-sister, is known for being a teen, at times a petulant one.</p> \n<p>But these characters are all just constructs of the television show.</p> \n<p>These sisters are defined by their various storylines on the television show and how <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1086761/fullcredits?ref_=tt_ov_st_sm"">their producers decide to package them</a>.</p> \n<p>With Kris at the helm of the show as an executive producer, the Kardashians have control over their narrative. They create exclusives (see: <a href=""http://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/kim-kardashian-kanye-west-wedding-finally-revealed-on-kuwtk-201429"">how the show dealt with Kim's weddings</a>), create their own stories (see: <a href=""http://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/kim-kardashian-gets-a-butt-x-ray-2011236"">how Kim got an x-ray of her butt</a> to dispel rumors of implants), and promote themselves and their own stories (see: any episode). The Kardashians live to sell themselves to pop culture, and know better than to give it away for free.</p> \n<p>The show has created five spinoff shows: <em>Kourtney and Kim Take Miami, Kourtney and Kim Take New York, Khloé and Lamar, Kourtney and Khloé Take the Hamptons, </em>and <em>Dash Dolls,</em> which was announced in April 2015<em>. </em>Each of those shows feels like a companion series to the tabloids we read, exploring things like Khloé's relationship with basketball player Lamar Odom at the time or Kourtney's various pregnancies. And more importantly for the Kardashian empire, they helped establish distinct personalities and name recognition for Kourtney and Khloé.</p> \n<h3>Would the Kardashians win the Game of Thrones?</h3> \n<p>Without a doubt, yes.</p> \n<p><em>Game of Thrones</em> is about endless deals and alliances. It's about how one can parlay small bits of power into something more enduring. Kris Jenner has proven she can do that. She makes Cersei Lannister look like Martha Stewart.</p> \n<h3>What is the Kardashian legacy?</h3> \n<p>It would be too simplistic and myopic to consider the Kardashians a <a href=""http://www.newsweek.com/2014/07/25/kardashians-killed-hamptons-257155.html"">troupe of famous, fantastic idiots</a>, a threat to everything we hold steadfast and dear.</p> \n<p>""You don't really act; you don't sing; you don't dance. You don't have any — forgive me — any talent,"" <a target=""new"" href=""https://vine.co/v/O2IpUL7AvUF/"">Barbara Walters told the family in 2011</a>.</p> \n<p>No, better to view them — especially Kris — as geniuses. There are people smarter, richer, and exponentially more talented than the Kardashians, but the Kardashians have found a way to turn themselves into one of the most successful empires in the world. They've bent celebrity culture to their will, and created their own avenue of fame.</p> \n<p>""Famous for being famous"" is usually the insult tethered to the Kardashians, but I'm just not sure that's as much of an insult as people want it to be. There have been many people famous for being famous (Jessica Simpson, Nick Lachey, any of the women on <em>The Hills</em>, Paris Hilton) who haven't lasted as long as the Kardashians or made as much money.</p> \n<p>Staying ""famous for being famous"" is actually difficult. And it's a testament to Kris's savvy that she's turned her family into a sustaining business, got fame in a stranglehold, and never let go.</p> \n<p>The Kardashians now go beyond the Kardashians. They've grown to include<strong> </strong>the Jenners, America's newest power family and another part of that legacy.</p> \n<h3>Who are the Jenners?</h3> \n<p>When people talk about the Jenners, they're referring to Caitlyn Jenner, her sons from her first marriage — Brody, Brandon, and Burt — and the two daughters — Kendall and Kylie — she had with Kris Jenner.</p> \n<p>Kendall might be the most successful up-and-coming young Jenner. She has a burgeoning modeling career, landing campaigns for fashion houses like Givenchy and Fendi:</p> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""3914278"">\n<img src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3914278/MTMxNjU1MzQzNTMxOTIzOTM0.jpg""> \n<div class=""caption""> \n<p>A Balmain ad featuring Kendall (in red) and Kylie (in blue) Jenner.</p> \n</div> \n</div> \n<p>But to be sure, at least some part of Kendall's success is owed to her family's high profile and notoriety. Her <a href=""http://www.celebuzz.com/2014-12-01/model-writes-kendall-jenner-an-open-letter-serious-shade-is-thrown/"">critics have said as much</a>, believing that her fame grabs attention that design houses want to cash in on. Her success has also pumped up the family's fashion credentials and helped them break into and network with the world of high fashion.</p> \n<h3>Why are the Jenners important?</h3> \n<p>In <em>KUWTK</em> canon, the Jenners began as the stepfamily to the Kardashian sisters and, over time, slowly became an extension of the Kardashian empire. Caitlyn, who was known as Bruce at the time, was portrayed as a doting father who was downplayed and dominated by Kris and his stepdaughters. Kris and Caitlyn's rocky marriage became a storyline on the show, and the show explicitly addressed the tension <a href=""http://hollywoodlife.com/2013/07/21/kardashian-family-greece-vacation-kuwtk-recap-brody-jenner/"">between Brody and Kris</a>, with him telling her she was not respecting his father while they were married. The show's ninth and 10th seasons explored Kris and Caitlyn's divorce and its impact on the children.</p> \n<p>Caitlyn came out as a transgender woman in an ABC special, and appeared on the cover of Vanity Fair's June issue. In July 2015, she debuted her new docu-series, <em>I Am Cait</em> — a <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/7/27/9049261/i-am-cait-caitlyn-jenner"">show that explores her transition</a>.</p> \n<p>Caitlyn has quickly become the most famous trans woman in America. And she has made a point of using her fame to shed light on the discrimination that transgender people face.</p> \n<h3>What is Caitlyn Jenner's show like?</h3> \n<p>The first episode aired Sunday, and it was a different in tone from <em>KUWTK</em> — it feels more earnest and altruistic. Brody, Brandon, and Burt, Caitlyn's sons, have said that they are not participating in the series. (It should also be said that Kris isn't involved in this project, but it is produced by Bunim/Murray, the same production company that works on <em>KUWTK</em>.)</p> \n<p>Since coming out, Caitlyn has been talking about the struggle and discrimination that transgender people face and how her story is one that comes from privilege. Many people don't have it as easy as her.</p> \n<p>And with this show, there seems to be a conscious effort to show how welcoming and at ease Caitlyn's television family is with her coming out:</p> \n<blockquote class=""twitter-video"" lang=""en""> \n<p lang=""en"" dir=""ltr"">""I couldn't be prouder. Caitlyn, you are beautiful."" - <a href=""https://twitter.com/khloekardashian"">@KhloeKardashian</a> <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/IAmCait?src=hash"">#IAmCait</a> <a href=""https://t.co/efH05Bi6vh"">https://t.co/efH05Bi6vh</a></p> \n— I Am Cait (@IAmCait) <a href=""https://twitter.com/IAmCait/status/625456548844679168"">July 27, 2015</a>\n</blockquote> \n<p> \n<script src=""//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"" charset=""utf-8""></script> \n</p> \n<p>The cynical side of me is afraid the Kardashians will use<em> I Am Cait</em> as another PR opportunity — Kim and her husband, Kanye West, made an appearance in the first episode. And after the show premiered, <a href=""http://hollywoodlife.com/2015/07/27/kim-kardashian-caitlyn-jenner-fight-i-am-cait-video/"">there were already headlines</a> written about a preview showing an argument Kim and Caitlyn have regarding Caitlyn bashing Kris.</p> \n<p>Nevertheless, there's something more measured and kinder in <em>I Am Cait </em>than you see in <em>KUWTK</em>. It's not going for the addictive vapidness that you find in <em>KUWTK. </em>Instead, there really seems to be an overt focus on seriously telling Cait's story in a gentler manner and it does something that <em>KUWTK</em> has never done — it addresses Caitlyn's privilege of wealth and fame.</p> \n<p>Caitlyn not having to deal with the discrimination and hate on the level that non-famous transgender people do has been one of the criticisms since her coming out. And there's a sense that Bunim/Murray and Caitlyn have taken it to heart. She talks about other transgender people's struggles, and the first episode shows her visiting the family of a transgender boy who killed himself.</p> \n<p><em>I Am Cait </em>genuinely cares about what you think of Caitlyn, and it wants to be a ""good"" show in a sense that it wants to do good by opening up the struggle transgender people face. It genuinely wants you to like Caitlyn. The Kardashians don't seem to care, just as long as you keep up.</p>",Music

One Direction says this isn't the end. (This is probably the end.),http://www.vox.com/2015/8/26/9208165/one-direction-breakup-break-hiatus,One Direction promises they're just taking a break.

They might take a year off and miss it. <b>They might take a year off and say you know what, I need another year off.</b>""</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>As if to twist that knife, Bunetta <a href=""http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop-shop/6677546/one-direction-hiatus-new-album-producer-interview"">told Billboard</a> that One Direction recorded their upcoming fifth album ""knowing it would be their last for a while.""</p> \n<h3>When does burnout become a breakup?</h3> \n<p>There's no question that One Direction have produced an astonishing amount of music, not to mention toured pretty constantly, since they formed in 2010 on the UK's <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0423776/?ref_=nv_sr_2""><i>X Factor</i></a>. <a href=""http://www.theverge.com/2015/8/25/9200849/one-direction-hiatus-by-the-numbers"">The Verge's tally</a> of One Direction's history counts five studio albums, 15 music videos, and a stunning 329 live shows. The group's members could probably use some time to sit down for some tea and a jammy dodger or five. The question is are they actually going to keep the band together? Or is this ""break"" a way to prime their passionate fans for the inevitable?</p> \n<p>After all, One Direction are far from the first boy band to pull the ""it's just a break"" card.</p> \n<h3>NSYNC (1995–2002)</h3> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""4000750"">\n<img src=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4000750/728775.jpg""> \n<div class=""caption""> \n<p>NSYNC, A+ jackets.</p> \n</div> \n</div> \n<p>NSYNC announced their ""temporary hiatus"" in 2002.

Eight years after emerging from the <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1055366/?ref_=nv_sr_1"">Disney Channel's bubblegum pop world</a>, the JoBros went through a series of cataclysmic events. First, they <a href=""http://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/jonas-brothers-delete-bands-twitter-account-after-canceling-tour-20131710"">called off their tour</a> right before dropping a new album. Next, they cited ""a deep rift within the band"" as the cause. Finally, they just admitted to <a href=""http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20750228,00.html"">People</a> that they were calling it — ""for now."" It was a ""unanimous decision,"" insisted middle brother Joe (the one with the perfect eyebrows).</p> \n<p>But while youngest brother Nick conceded that they were taking a break, he left the door open by refusing to call it a formal break<i>up</i>. ""It's really hard to say forever,"" he said. ""We're closing a chapter, for sure.""</p> \n<p>That's all very well and good, but we can probably go ahead and call the Jonas Brothers a formal wrap now that the very same Nick is currently in his ""surprisingly great solo work"" chapter.</p> \n<p><iframe width=""560"" height=""315"" frameborder=""0"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/yw04QD1LaB0""></iframe></p> \n<p>[Note: The ""surprisingly great"" claim was made before we watched this video, which is mostly just weird.]</p> \n<h3>The Wanted (2009–2014?)</h3> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""4000774"">\n<img src=""https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4000774/453983797.jpg""> \n<div class=""caption""> \n<p>The Wanted, Minnie Mouse.</p> \n</div> \n</div> \n<p>Oh sure, Brit band the Wanted <i>wanted</i> to be One Direction. They even went so far as to start <a href=""http://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/one-direction-fight-wanted-zayn-1937561"">several Twitter feuds</a>, though 1D was so unimpressed that they dropped the most devastating clapback of all: ""We're too busy"" to care.</p> \n<p>Eventually, the Wanted's success with singles like <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ggzxInyzVE"">""Glad You Came""</a> wasn't enough to sustain their interest in boy-banding, so they left it to the professionals and <a href=""http://www.mtv.com/news/2077741/nathan-sykes-the-wanted-reunion/"">announced</a> that they would be ""tak[ing] time to pursue personal endeavours"" in 2014.</p> \n<p>Unsurprisingly, their parting statement was unwilling to write off a reunion for good: ""The band wants to stress to their fans that they will continue on as The Wanted and look forward to many successful projects in the future."" The closest The Wanted has come to a reunion since was band member Nathan Sykes coyly saying, ""Never say never,"" but we know this game, Nathan. We will not be burned again.</p> \n<h3>The hardest part of breaking up is telling people you're breaking up</h3> \n<p>This isn't to say that <i>all</i> hope is lost. The men of 98 Degrees seem pretty serious about this reunion, though it's hard to say who exactly was clamoring for it. The Backstreet Boys <a href=""http://backstreetboys.com/events"">are touring</a> through Brazil and on EuroCruises alike, and even came out with a <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2712154/"">behind</a><a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2712154/"">-</a><a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2712154/"">the</a><a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2712154/"">-</a><a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2712154/"">scenes documentary</a> this very year. Even Blink 182 took a hiatus, but the group released a new album in 2011 and <a href=""http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/tom-delonge-leaves-blink-182-20150126"">stubbornly marches on</a> through pop punk festivals today, even without founding member Tom DeLonge.</p> \n<p>The sad case is that these are the exceptions rather than the rule. Reassuring fans that ""solo projects"" aren't going to derail the group and/or taking a ""temporary"" ""hiatus"" ""to pursue other projects"" are classic boy band moves. They keep panic at bay while the band members quietly move on.</p> \n<p>We get that pulling the plug on a successful group is hard, especially when you've got a fan base that lives and dies by your word. But as anyone who's ever been <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/7/2/8886787/ghosting-dating-explained"">ghosted</a> on knows, getting dumped is easier when you actually know you've been dumped.</p>",Music

The guest appearances have been at turns inspired and confusing, ranging from <a href=""https://twitter.com/taylorswift13/status/619782629194338304?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">the Weeknd</a> to <a href=""https://twitter.com/taylorswift13/status/604879053384990720"">Imagine Dragons</a>, <a href=""http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2015/08/taylor-swift-justin-timberlake-mirrors-los-angeles-selena-gomez"">Justin Timberlake</a> to her <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcIy9NiNbmo"">""Bad Blood""</a> <a href=""https://twitter.com/taylorswift13/status/604734987007590400"">model crew</a>, girl groups like <a href=""https://twitter.com/littlemix/status/632828093837676544"">Little Mix</a> and <a href=""https://twitter.com/taylorswift13/status/632437959849979904"">Fifth Harmony</a> to <a href=""https://twitter.com/taylorswift13/status/635367496778780672"">Chris Rock and Matt LeBlanc</a>. Even Ian McKellen <a href=""http://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/ian-mckellen-turned-down-taylor-swifts-1989-tour-invitation-2015318"">recently revealed</a> that he and best friend Patrick Stewart got an invitation to the 1989 stage, but had to turn it down due to prior commitments.</p> \n<p>As Swift said at her show in <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2ffzWQUEzU"">Santa Clara</a> on August 15:</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>""Any artist that you see on the 1989 world tour stage is here because they wanted to be, out of the goodness of their own heart. They wanted to be here to perform for you, and to surprise you. This means they came here for free. This means they could've been doing anything else...but they wanted to be with you.</p> \n<p>They're here because they love you, and that's such an incredible honor.""</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Swift's claim that all the 1989 world tour guests wanted<i> </i>to be there ""out of the goodness of their own heart"" is a lovely sentiment, but I have a feeling that everyone walking the ""1989 runway"" is less interested in pleasing fans than in absorbing the incredible attention the moment affords them. Swift is one of the biggest pop performers on the planet. Any friend of hers is a friend of millions.</p> \n<p>(Thank god Sirs Ian McKellen and Patrick Stewart have each other.)</p> \n<p>As for Swift, I believe she is thrilled to welcome each and every one of these people to the stage. Every time she introduces a new guest, she throws her hands up like she's on a roller coaster, giddy with some combination of excitement, triumph, and power. Whatever the motivations for the guests — fun, publicity, a ""what the hell"" lark — one thing is abundantly clear: <span>Taylor Swift is having the time of her life.</span></p> \n<p>To save you the trouble of going over her dozens of guests, here are the eight most memorable surprise appearances from Taylor Swift's 1989 tour — so far, anyway.</p> \n<h3>8) Joan Baez and Julia Roberts (Santa Clara, August 15)</h3> \n<p> </p> \n<blockquote lang=""en"" class=""twitter-tweet""> \n<p lang=""en"" dir=""ltr"">Tonight Joan Baez and Julia Roberts danced it out to 'Style'.

Did they know each other beforehand? Is this part of a blood pact neither remembers making in the '90s? How many people in that stadium were appropriately heartbroken to get a Joan Baez <i>appearance</i> instead of a Joan Baez <i>performance</i>?</p> \n<p>So, okay, this isn't one of Swift's ""best"" surprises, but you can't beat it for the sheer ""Why is this happening?"" factor. The Baez/Roberts pairing also highlights another important demographic of Taylor Swift's guests of choice, namely the ""We're doing this for our kids"" quadrant. (See also: the aforementioned<a href=""http://time.com/4007819/taylor-swift-matt-leblanc-chris-rock-mary-j-blige/""> Rock and LeBlanc</a>.)</p> \n<h3>7) Lisa Kudrow (Los Angeles, August 26)</h3> \n<p><iframe width=""640"" height=""360"" frameborder=""0"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/cleIUW-ergI""></iframe></p> \n<p>Many give Los Angeles grief for its smog and entertainment-obsessed industries, but the city's best revenge is its proximity to just about every major star. Ergo, and to be upfront: LA is disproportionately represented on this list. (Swift also played there for five nights in a row.)</p> \n<p>After confusing everyone by bringing out LeBlanc, she made a more understandable <i>Friends</i> choice the next night with Lisa Kudrow, who appeared (barely) in character as the folk-singing Phoebe Buffay.</p> \n<p>Swift was visibly thrilled. She told the stadium with a wink that this guest ""has only ever played in coffeehouses"" before they strummed acoustic guitars in tandem for a stadium sing-along of Buffay's biggest (and only) hit, ""Smelly Cat."" The only thing that could have made it more of a trip for <i>Friends</i> fans would be if they did a breakdown à la the recorded version of ""Smelly Cat,"" which was decidedly more pop than its folksy predecessor.</p> \n<p><iframe width=""854"" height=""480"" frameborder=""0"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/XNXIZuIBJKs""></iframe></p> \n<h3>6) Beck and St. Vincent (Los Angeles, August 25)</h3> \n<p> </p> \n<blockquote lang=""en"" class=""twitter-tweet""> \n<p lang=""en"" dir=""ltr"">Getting to play 'Dreams' with <a href=""https://twitter.com/beck"">@Beck</a> and <a href=""https://twitter.com/st_vincent"">@st_vincent</a> is something I'll remember forever.

Beck joined Swift to perform his latest single ""Dreams,"" with guitar goddess St. Vincent accompanying. Videos show much of the floor audience blinking in confusion at the runway instead of dancing along.</p> \n<p>This is a shame, because Beck and St. Vincent's performance on the Staples Center stage is rock solid. Beck matched the stadium's energy by jumping up and down like an excitable teen at his first concert. St. Vincent (a.k.a. Annie Clark) accompanied him on her angular new <a href=""https://twitter.com/st_vincent/status/636969823667253248"">Eddie Ball signature guitar</a>. Every so often, Swift noticed that St. Vincent was standing off on her own and went over to lean a friendly elbow on her shoulder. St. Vincent is <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gescsd4ZwcU"">a documented Swift fan</a>, but she eventually had to shrug her off to strut down the runway and <i>rip</i> her guitar solo to shreds.</p> \n<p> </p> \n<blockquote class=""instagram-media"" data-instgrm-version=""4""> \n<div> \n<div> \n<div></div> \n</div> \n<p><a href=""https://instagram.com/p/61sdf_DvFS/"" target=""_top"">St. Vincent casually slaying that guitar solo while pyro goes off in the background.

After watching videos of the performance, she was absolutely correct.

Swift is so comfortable in the country world that her voice noticeably settles when she allows it to twang. So it's unsurprising her Natalie Maines introduction gushed with praise for the Dixie Chicks frontwoman, whom she cited as a vital influence on her early musical aspirations:</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>""If not for this woman and her band, I would not have known that you can be quirky, and fun, and yourself, and outspoken, and brave, and real...I wouldn't have dreamed the things that I dreamed, and I wouldn't be on this stage today.""</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>The two women then broke out into the Dixie Chicks' revenge fantasy song ""Goodbye Earl,"" which was also apparently Swift's ""go-to talent show song.""</p> \n<p>This appearance therefore accomplishes two important things: 1) Maines gets to fill a stadium with her astonishing powerhouse of a voice, and 2) we get to imagine a tiny Swift strutting around a fold-out stage while trilling, ""Well, it wasn't two weeks after she got married that / Wanda started gettin' abused / She put on dark glasses and long sleeved blouses / And make-up to cover her bruise...""</p> \n<p>(Note: ""Goodbye Earl"" is a very strange choice to sing through a talent show grin.)</p> \n<h3>\n<b>1) </b>Alanis Morissette (Los Angeles, August 24)</h3> \n<p><iframe width=""640"" height=""360"" frameborder=""0"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/YYZX4l7MTJE""></iframe></p> \n<p>Swift tends to take her time introducing her guests. She builds up the anticipation, starting from a conspiratorial whisper before revving up to a grand announcement in the bombastic style of a circus ringleader (which, well, she kind of is). To pump up the crowd for Morissette's impending arrival, Swift prowled the stage in a leather catsuit and intoned:</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>""She inspired a generation of confessional female singer/songwriters, who all of a sudden felt like you could actually say these raw feelings that you had. You could actually sing about your real life, you could put detail into it. You could get really really <i>mad</i> if you wanted to.""</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>This is just a very good summation of Alanis Morissette's appeal. Also, Swift sells the hell out of it. There's no way she could care deeply about every single guest on her tour, but this moment echoes her adoration for Maines in its sincerity. Swift has built her career on confessional songwriting, so it's genuinely touching to see her paying tribute to a woman who both popularized and challenged the genre.</p> \n<p>Then Morissette emerged from the floor, singing ""You Oughta Know.""</p> \n<p>Of all the songs off her smash album <i>Jagged Little Pill</i>, ""You Oughta Know"" is perhaps the most explicitly angry.  ""You Oughta Know"" tells the story of heartbreak through rage-induced tears, a feeling Swift came closest to capturing with ""Blank Space."" ""Raw"" is absolutely the right word.</p> \n<p>Watching Swift and Morissette belt the song together is startling, then exhilarating. It's exactly what every surprise 1989 world tour appearance should be like — though it will be harder to thrill people when they come to expect something so great every time.</p>",Music
"Carly Rae Jepsen: pop savant, thoughtful songwriter, excellent roller skater",http://www.vox.com/2015/9/8/9263279/carly-rae-jepsen-new-album,Most pop albums are lucky to have three great songs. Carly Rae Jepsenâ€™s Emotion has 12.,"<p>There I was, speeding around a roller rink to a Canadian pop star's latest hit like something out of a <em>Sweet Valley High</em> book. The neon lights pulsed in and out to the beat, casting shadows on the swerving crowd as they sang in unison: ""<i>R</i><em>un away with me / Run away with me...</em>""</p> \n<p>And then there I was, winded on the floor of the roller rink, skates up and spinning like something out of a Wile E. Coyote cartoon.</p> \n<p>Wiping out wasn't <em>quite</em> the delightful image I had in mind when I went to Carly Rae Jepsen's ""listening party"" on August 26, held at Moonlight Rollerway in Glendale, California. Gliding blissfully around a Technicolor rink was supposed to be the perfect way to listen to Jepsen's new electro-pop album <em>Emotion, </em>officially released on August 21.</p> \n<p>At the very least, though, it gave me something to talk to Carly Rae herself about in the 30 seconds allotted to the meet-and-greet. The rink wasn't packed to the brim, but the people there — ranging from babbling preteen girls to men enthusiastically dancing in their skates — chattered excitedly amongst themselves about being in Jepsen's presence.</p> \n<p>Jepsen smiled warmly as I tottered over. She was wearing vertigo-inducing heels, but I still towered over her in my skates. ""I'm going as fast as I can,"" I assured her, ""I just wiped out super hard during my favorite song of yours."" She laughed and put a reassuring hand on my shoulder as one of her assistants took a picture. ""I'm totally going to do the same thing,"" she said. ""I'm wearing shorts under this dress.""</p> \n<p>In the picture, we're laughing so hard the image is blurred. We look more like best friends than a pop star and a fan — which is exactly how Carly Rae Jepsen wants it.</p> \n<p>Here's what you should know about pop music's friendliest Canadian export.</p> \n<h3>Carly Rae Jepsen is not a one-hit wonder (but yes, ""Call Me Maybe"" is a perfect pop song)</h3> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""4028950"">\n<img src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4028950/153133272.jpg""> \n<div class=""caption""> \n<p>Jepsen in 2012.</p> \n</div> \n</div> \n<p>The 29-year-old Jepsen is best known for her 2011 bubblegum plea ""Call Me Maybe."" The song gained worldwide attention when <a href=""https://twitter.com/justinbieber/status/152843702790914050"">Justin Bieber tweeted</a> about it, calling it ""the catchiest song I've ever heard lol."" He and then-girlfriend Selena Gomez were so obsessed with the song that producer Scooter Braun swooped in to represent Jepsen, who had previously been limited to Canadian radio.</p> \n<p>Then came one of the greatest social media pushes for a song ever, in the form of a charmingly low-resolution YouTube video in which Bieber, Gomez, and their friends lip-synced along to ""Call Me Maybe."" While it was undoubtedly a calculated publicity move, the result still feels loose, like the teen idols hit that late hour at a sleepover when sanity becomes optional.</p> \n<p><iframe width=""420"" height=""315"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/AsBsBU3vn6M"" frameborder=""0""></iframe></p> \n<p>After that, Jepsen was off. Her official video for ""Call Me Maybe"" currently has more than 715 million views on YouTube.</p> \n<p><iframe width=""560"" height=""315"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/fWNaR-rxAic"" frameborder=""0""></iframe></p> \n<p>Jepsen's subsequent album, <em><a href=""https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/kiss-deluxe-version/id557372575"">Kiss</a></em><em>,</em> struggled, however, without another single to match the platinum-selling ""Call Me Maybe."" It sold a relatively disappointing 292,000 copies, and the buzz surrounding Jepsen started to fade.</p> \n<p>There are plenty of artists who would happily live off the massive success of a song like ""Call Me Maybe,"" and there's no shame in that game. Still, Jepsen was eager to use the single's momentum to build a more lasting pop career.</p> \n<p>Enter <em><a href=""https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/e-mo-tion-deluxe/id1008305831"">Emotion</a></em>.</p> \n<h3>Carly Rae Jepsen's new album <em>Emotion</em> is that rare pop record that doesn't depend on singles</h3> \n<p>While <em>Kiss</em> depended on the success of ""Call Me Maybe"" as a single, <em>Emotion</em>'s priority is creating a more perfect pop album. Braun told <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/02/arts/music/carly-rae-jepsen-with-a-new-album-is-definitely-changing-her-number.html"">the New York Times</a> that while they counted on singles for <em>Kiss</em>, with <i>Emotion</i> they scrapped that mentality entirely in favor of creating a more cohesive, ""critically acclaimed album."" Still, they released the song that hews closest to ""Call Me Maybe"" as a single to prime people for Jepsen's return. ""I Really Like You"" didn't reach the zenith that ""Call Me Maybe"" did — and Jepsen acknowledges that no song of hers likely ever will again — but it at least got <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV5lzRHrGeg"">an accompanying video</a> starring none other than an ecstatic Tom Hanks.</p> \n<p>Jepsen has a writing credit on every single one of the new album's songs, and is reportedly meticulous about her choices. After scrapping an entire album of folk songs, she brought in musicians she admired to produce and co-write the tracks. <em>Emotion</em>'s guest talent includes <a href=""http://siamusic.net/music"">Sia</a>, <a href=""http://bloodorange.nyc/music"">Blood Orange</a>'s Dev Hynes, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ariel_Rechtshaid"">Ariel Rechtshaid</a>, Tegan &amp; Sara, and <a href=""http://www.vampireweekend.com/"">Vampire Weekend</a>'s Rostam Batmanglij. Together, Jepsen and her collaborators reportedly took more than <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/02/arts/music/carly-rae-jepsen-with-a-new-album-is-definitely-changing-her-number.html?_r=0"">200 possible songs</a>, whittled them down, and streamlined them into bite-size pop fantasies.</p> \n<p><iframe width=""560"" height=""315"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/TeccAtqd5K8"" frameborder=""0""></iframe></p> \n<p>The songs are lacquered with glossy '80s synth, alternately lush and a little wicked. They sometimes even give way to throwback '90s saxophone solos. While some songs are grander than others, like the sweeping opener ""Run Away With Me,"" every one has merits. ""Let's Get Lost"" is pure joy, bopping to and fro without overselling the saccharine message. The Hynes-produced title track <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kV9sNmujCPk"">""Emotion""</a> pops and sizzles, delivering bite with a grin as Jepsen sings, ""Be tormented for me, babe."" She's not the wide-eyed girl she was in ""Call Me Maybe,"" but she's still relentlessly hopeful.</p> \n<p>Most pop albums are lucky if they have three standout songs. <em>Emotion</em> has 12.</p> \n<h3>Carly Rae Jepsen was once a literal Disney princess</h3> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""4028940"">\n<img src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4028940/466872757.jpg""> \n<div class=""caption""> \n<p>Carly Rae Jepsen, princess.</p> \n</div> \n</div> \n<p>This isn't strictly necessary knowledge <em>per se, </em>but the fact that Jepsen took a few months off in 2014 to play Cinderella on Broadway is one of those facts that can actually call itself ""fun.""</p> \n<p>See also:</p> \n<h3>Carly Rae Jepsen is a very good roller skater (who <em>really</em> knows her fans)</h3> \n<p>After the meet-and-greet was over, Jepsen strapped on her own roller skates and took to the rink. A couple of men in striped referee shirts trailed her, but she steadily pushed along, grinning wide, completely unconcerned. She sang along with her fans to her breezy ballad ""When I Needed You."" She started a skating conga line and wriggled to the Pussycat Dolls' <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSxNsr4wmA"">""Don't Cha.""</a> Occasionally, someone would whip out a phone and skate alongside her for a selfie, some even grabbing at her in their enthusiasm. Jepsen never missed a beat.</p> \n<p>Despite the early critical acclaim, <em>Emotion</em> isn't selling nearly as well as expected. It only <a href=""http://headlineplanet.com/home/2015/08/28/carly-rae-jepsen-emotion-first-week-sales/"">sold 16,000 copies</a> its first week. <em>Kiss</em>, meanwhile,<em> </em>had sold 46,000. This could be thanks to some combination of music services like Spotify streaming the album, or the fact that <em>Emotion </em>leaked after Jepsen released it two months early in Japan, where she is <a href=""https://twitter.com/carlyraejepsen/status/613602078817021952"">particularly beloved</a>.</p> \n<p>But Jepsen presses on. The week of <em>Emotion</em>'s release, she held several events in Los Angeles that highlight just how well she knows her fan base. In addition to the downright adorable roller-skating listening party, she took to <a href=""http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/music/posts/la-et-ms-carly-rae-jepsen-troubadour-emotion-20150825-story.html"">the Sunset Strip</a> for a sold-out concert, jumped around in <a href=""https://instagram.com/p/6_rTexqVpY/?taken-by=carlyraejepsen"">a tutu with glow sticks</a> at a fun run, and hosted a sweaty <a href=""https://instagram.com/p/67lqx-qVkT/?taken-by=carlyraejepsen"">night of dancing</a> at one of LA's only 18-and-over dance clubs.</p> \n<p>These events might be small compared with those of other pop stars of the moment like, say, Taylor Swift's goliath stadium parties. But these microtargeted events are right in line with the kind of music Jepsen has made her own with <em>Emotion</em>. The fans who are there for Carly Rae are fervently head over heels for the tiny pop powerhouse with the blunt-cut bangs.  When you go to a Carly Rae Jepsen event, you expect to have an uncomplicated good time, while smiling your most mischievous smile.</p> \n<p>After about 10 minutes of skating with Jepsen, the crowd almost seemed to forget she was there. It wasn't that people were less excited. It was that they got so distracted by the songs that they just forgot to gawk. Jepsen didn't mind, happily blending into the crowd in her loose headband and sparkly black dress. Pop stardom is one thing, but Jepsen would rather let people get lost in her music.</p>",Music

Ergo, lyrics like, ""How do I live, how do I breathe?/When you're not here I'm suffocating.""</p> \n<p>Making a <em>Bond </em>theme one's own is tricky business, since it needs to fit in the thematic mold of the movie and the current<strong> </strong>Bond.

A hip-hop musical about Alexander Hamilton is Broadway'sÂ hottestÂ ticket.Â Here'sÂ why.,http://www.vox.com/2015/9/30/9419835/hamilton-musical-lin-manuel-miranda,"The new musical and its creator/star, Lin-Manuel Miranda, are unlike anything else in musical theater.","<p>Even those who live far away from the bright lights of Broadway and pay little attention to the goings-on in musical theater have likely heard rumblings of <em>Hamilton. </em></p> \n<p>There's a reason for that: After a sold-out run off-Broadway that was extended three times, <em>Hamilton </em>quickly and loudly made the transition to Broadway, selling <a href=""http://www.playbill.com/news/article/hamilton-sells-6.5-million-worth-of-broadway-tickets-in-11-days-344647"">millions of dollars' worth of tickets</a> months before it opened. Now, less than two months after its Broadway bow, it's one of New York's hottest (and most expensive) tickets. That's unlikely to change after 2016's Tonys, for which <em>Hamilton </em>is a sure bet to take home a few statues, if not all<em> </em>of them — possibly even the ones it's not nominated for.</p> \n<p>But even those who don't live in New York, or aren't planning a trip there anytime soon, should pay attention to <em>Hamilton. </em>As far as mainstream musicals go, <em>Hamilton </em>is revolutionary (in multiple senses of the word), a fact that was clarified on Tuesday, September 29, when the show's creator and star, Lin-Manuel Miranda, <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/29/arts/macarthur-genius-grant-winners-for-2015-are-announced.html"">was awarded</a> a MacArthur ""genius grant,"" the annual $625,000 fellowship extended to ""talented individuals who have shown extraordinary originality and dedication in their creative pursuits.""</p> \n<p><em>Hamilton</em> is not Miranda's first successful musical (more on that in a bit), but it is easily his best and most exciting. Here's a primer on what makes the show so audacious, why people are talking about it, and how you can experience it (sort of) from the comfort of your living room.</p> \n<h3>So who's this Hamilton guy?</h3> \n<p>Maybe a glimpse of the show itself will help clear it up:</p> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4109078/hamilton.0.jpg"" alt=""Hamilton"" data-chorus-asset-id=""4109078""></p> \n<p>That's right — as evidenced by the britches and velvet blazers, we're talking about <em>Alexander</em> Hamilton, the United States' first Treasury secretary and one of its Founding Fathers. Hamilton was also a key adviser to George Washington during and after the American Revolution, and he became one of the main interpreters of the Constitution through the Federalist Papers, of which he wrote a staggering 51 (out of 85 total).</p> \n<h3>So it's sort of like <em>1776</em>?</h3> \n<p>God, no. It's 2015, and this is a Lin-Manuel Miranda joint, which means <em>Hamilton </em>is as far away as it gets from that seminal (but fairly musty) musical interpretation of our nation's birth.</p> \n<p>For starters, <i>Hamilton</i> is often described as a ""hip-hop musical,"" though that doesn't quite get at the melange of musical styles evident in the production<em>. </em>But the music, which was all written by Miranda, is certainly rooted in the language of modern hip-hop, as well as in other traditionally black musical forms such as R&amp;B and jazz, with a dash of Broadway traditionalism and Gilbert and Sullivan–style patter (which is basically just rapping anyway).</p> \n<h3>That seems … different.</h3> \n<p>Okay, granted, one of this nation's premier old white dudes may seem like an incongruous subject for such a modern-day musical treatment, but <em>Hamilton </em>doesn't merely justify the combination of subject and tone; it brings new shading and nuance to both. As Miranda himself has put it, Alexander Hamilton ""embodies hip-hop,"" which isn't nearly as glib a statement as it may seem.</p> \n<p><em>Hamilton</em> tracks the life of Alexander Hamilton from the time he arrived in the US as an immigrant from the Virgin Islands through his (spoiler alert for American history) death in a duel with Aaron Burr. Hamilton was a penniless orphan of illegitimate birth, and his outspoken (and oft-controversial) ascent through the nascent United States government is the sort of rags-to-riches story that not only makes for good drama, but also merges shockingly well with the energy and attitude of modern-day hip-hop culture.</p> \n<p>In fact, Miranda originally conceived of <em>Hamilton </em>as a hip-hop concept album. Back in 2009, he performed a song from that in-progress work at the White House's ""evening of poetry, music, and spoken word"" for Barack and Michelle Obama, who clearly loved it.</p> \n<p><iframe width=""560"" height=""315"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/WNFf7nMIGnE"" frameborder=""0""></iframe></p> \n<h3>I liked that! Is it in <em>Hamilton</em>?</h3> \n<p>Yup! It's the opening number, in fact, functioning as a sort of prologue setting the stage for the events to come. However, the song, ""Alexander Hamilton,"" has been fleshed out considerably in the transition from ""The Hamilton Mixtape"" to <em>Hamilton, </em>incorporating nearly the entire cast of characters, which also includes George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Marquis de Lafayette, and more.</p> \n<h3>That's a lot of old white dudes...</h3> \n<p>It sure is! But one of the most interesting things about <em>Hamilton </em>is its approach to casting those old white dudes. As you may recall from that earlier photo, <em>Hamilton</em>'s cast is decidedly multicultural — in fact, the only actual white dude in the Broadway cast is <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2676147/"" target=""_blank"">Jonathan Groff</a> (a Broadway superstar who also starred in HBO's <em>Looking</em>), who plays King George at a narrative remove from the main action.</p> \n<p>The choice to cast actors of color as historical white men (including Miranda himself as Hamilton) sounds like a pointed, potentially distracting choice, but only the former is true in this case. As Miranda <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/13/theater/hamilton-heads-to-broadway-in-a-hip-hop-retelling.html?_r=0"">told the New York Times</a>, ""Our cast looks like America looks now, and that’s certainly intentional. … It's a way of pulling you into the story and allowing you to leave whatever cultural baggage you have about the founding fathers at the door.""</p> \n<p>While that sounds potentially disrespectful to all the black men and women whose stories aren't taught in American history class, it really does work in the context of <em>Hamilton. </em>There's very little suspension of disbelief required to consider Miranda's Hamilton as a Hispanic man, or Thomas Jefferson (Daveed Diggs) as a black man, or Elizabeth Schuyler Hamilton (Phillipa Soo) as an Asian-American woman, because the musical's book and lyrics so masterfully play up the revolutionary spirit and political uncertainty of the time that <em>Hamilton </em>really does feel like it's taking place in the modern day, rather than in the pages of a history book.</p> \n<p><iframe frameborder=""0"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/jaSD7NY3SCo"" height=""480"" width=""853""></iframe></p> \n<p>The play also, tellingly, plays up Hamilton and others as ""immigrants"" to this country, which feels like a pointed reminder that no one race or culture can really lay claim to America or its history. (And, in case you were wondering, yes, <i>Hamilton'</i>s content does touch lightly on slavery, but it's outside the context of race.)</p> \n<p>The casting of actors of color is undeniably a bold choice, and one of <em>Hamilton</em>'s most talked-about aspects. It's also an interesting case study in so-called ""colorblind"" or ""nontraditional"" casting, which is forever a hot topic in all visual media, and in theater in particular lately: Recent imbroglios over ""whitewashed"" casting in high-profile productions of <em><a href=""http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/theatre-dance/news/trevor-nunn-defends-all-white-shakespeare-histories-10457512.html"">The War of the Roses </a></em>and <em><a href=""http://www.playbill.com/news/article/casting-and-advertisement-for-the-mikado-in-nyc-stirs-controversy-amongst-asian-community-362609"">The Mikado</a></em><em> </em>have highlighted the need for greater diversity in stage casting, something <em>Hamilton </em>functions as a direct response to.</p> \n<p>But for all that loaded context, when you're in the midst of the material, experiencing <em>Hamilton </em>itself, it feels utterly natural, less a political statement than a bold (and successful) artistic choice.</p> \n<h3>Okay, I'm intrigued, but I can't really afford a trip to New York right now.</h3> \n<p>That's okay — neither can I, and neither can a lot of people. Luckily for us, the <a href=""http://atlanticrecords.com/HamiltonMusic/"">original Broadway cast recording of </a><a href=""http://atlanticrecords.com/HamiltonMusic/""><em>Hamilton </em></a><a href=""http://atlanticrecords.com/HamiltonMusic/"">was released </a>in September, which means at least the audio portion of <em>Hamilton </em>is now available to all.</p> \n<p>What's more, <em>Hamilton </em>is what's known as a sung-through musical, which means there's little to no dialogue in the play that isn't part of a song. That means you can listen to the <em>Hamilton </em>OBCR and experience more or less the entire show from beginning to end (well, minus the visual element, but still). At nearly two and a half hours long, it constitutes a fairly major time investment, but 20 bucks and 143 minutes for the soundtrack is a lot more reasonable for the casual theater-goer than a trip to see <em>Hamilton </em>onstage.</p> \n<p>There's also the possibility of waiting it out until <em>Hamilton </em>goes on tour or is remounted in a city near you. But that's not ideal for a couple of reasons. First, nothing of the sort has been announced or even hinted at yet, given that <em>Hamilton </em>is still a brand new show; you'll probably need to wait years to see it somewhere other than New York. Second, and more importantly, subsequent <em>Hamilton </em>productions will likely have a new cast, which means seeing the show without its star and driving force: Lin-Manuel Miranda.</p> \n<h3>Okay, so what's the deal with this Miranda guy you keep talking about?</h3> \n<p><a href=""http://www.linmanuel.com/"">Lin-Manuel Miranda</a> has been a bright light on Broadway since 2008, when his musical <em>In the Heights </em>became a sensation. Having written the earliest drafts of <em>In the Heights</em> when he was a sophomore in college, Miranda officially became a Hot Young Talent when he took home the Best Musical and Best Original Score Tonys at the tender age of 28. (He was also nominated for Best Leading Actor in a Musical.)</p> \n<p><em>In the Heights — </em>which also features a book by Pulitzer winner Quiara Alegría Hudes — is an ensemble musical that takes place over the course of three days in modern-day Washington Heights, a traditionally Dominican-American New York neighborhood, with music heavily influenced by hip-hop and Latin music sounds. In the original production, Miranda starred as the narrator and main protagonist, Usnavi, and became inextricably linked to the musical's success.</p> \n<p><iframe frameborder=""0"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/UvVgm4imyj0"" height=""480"" width=""853""></iframe></p> \n<p>Miranda also played a major part in a couple of other memorable Tony moments, though as a behind-the-scenes player. Even those who pay little to no attention to the Tonys likely remember a moment from the 2011 ceremony that went viral the next day, when host Neil Patrick Harris ended the telecast with a  ""rap-up"" of all the highlights from the show that was just ending. It was undoubtedly the highlight of the night.</p> \n<p><iframe frameborder=""0"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/1Ocht_vicpc"" height=""480"" width=""853""></iframe></p> \n<p>Incorporating multiple specific references to key events in the ceremony, the rap was clearly composed on the fly, during the ceremony — by none other than Lin-Manual Miranda, with his writing partner Tommy Kail. (Do yourself a favor and watch Miranda's <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CR-sAit8LE"">video blog</a> of them writing during the ceremony.) Two years later, they repeated the feat for the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCy8CCgM59s"">2013 Tonys</a>, and penned Harris's opening number as well.</p> \n<p>Between <em>In the Heights</em> and the Tony raps, Miranda had clearly established himself as a wildly gifted and ambitious lyricist, but the extent of that ambition didn't become fully apparent until <em>Hamilton. </em>Inspired by a book he read while on break from <em>In the Heights </em>— <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Alexander-Hamilton-Ron-Chernow/dp/0143034758/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1443556984&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=ron+chernow+alexander+hamilton"">Ron Chernow's </a><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Alexander-Hamilton-Ron-Chernow/dp/0143034758/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1443556984&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=ron+chernow+alexander+hamilton""><em>Alexander Hamilton</em></a><em> — </em>Miranda actually thought to himself, ""What the world needs right now is a hip-hop-influenced retelling of the life of Alexander Hamilton, and I should be the one to write and perform it."" The chutzpah and vision required to not only think up but also see through such a notion —at age 35, no less — is no small thing, and people are rightly taking notice, including the MacArthur Foundation.</p> \n<p>Even more so than with <em>In the Heights, </em>Miranda is <em>Hamilton'</em>s defining aspect — and not just because he wrote and stars in it. Miranda and his work represent an exciting and unexpected new course musical theater can chart in the future, one that's strongly informed by but not beholden to years of Broadway tradition.</p> \n<p>Miranda, and <em>Hamilton, </em>is clearly influenced by classic musicals — including <em>1776, </em>for what it's worth — and storied composers like Stephen Sondheim. But there's also a strong vein of pop musicality that runs through his work. He straddles the line between the musical theater establishment and popular entertainment in a way few manage with as much style <em>and</em> substance.</p> \n<p>But ultimately, there's something utterly singular and personal about <em>Hamilton </em>that rises above all that. There's a ""How did this even happen?"" wonder to experiencing this show,<em> </em>which unquestionably stems from Miranda's unique vision.</p> \n<h3>Okay, I need to see this in person!</h3> \n<p>Then you better get on it, and quick. <em>Hamilton </em>is currently playing at New York's Richard Rodgers Theatre and is booking through September 2016 (though it should run much, much longer). Tickets are already extremely limited, and range in price from $65 to $156.</p> \n<p>However, front-row seats for every performance have been set aside for a lottery, where those who enter get the chance to pay only $10 — <a href=""https://www.bankmobile.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/US_10_Series_2003_obverse.jpg"">get it?</a> — for up to two tickets. You can only enter the day of, two and a half hours before the show starts, so it's a long shot. But hey, stranger things — like, say, the mega-success of a hip-hop musical centered on the life of Alexander Hamilton — have happened.</p>",Music
Music Friday: Futurebirds,http://www.vox.com/culture/2015/10/2/9441087/music-friday-futurebirds,Some slightly psychedelic Southern rock for your weekend.,"<p>One of the more delightful developments of the last few years in the politico-media blogosphere is economist Paul Krugman's decision that, advancing years be damned, he was going to get into that <a href=""http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/07/31/friday-night-music-of-monsters-and-men-crystals/"">indie music</a> the kids are listening to these days.</p> \n<p>I am on Team Aging Hipster myself. I've always made a point of keeping up with new music, pretty obsessively. (Matter of fact, I've made a mix of the year's best music every year since 2000 — you can download them <a href=""http://realish.com/realish-music-mixes/"">here</a>.) I figure if Krugman can do music blogging, so can I.</p> \n<p>So on occasional Fridays, I'm going to do a short post on a band I think deserves wider exposure. I have nothing against pop music (Carly Rae Jepsen's <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/9/8/9263279/carly-rae-jepsen-new-album"">new album</a> is genuinely great), but I'll generally focus on more obscure stuff.</p> \n<p>Today's band hails, as so many great bands have, from Athens, Georgia. <a href=""http://www.futurebirdsmusic.com/"">Futurebirds</a> were formed in 2008; I discovered them in 2013 with the release of their second full-length, <em><a href=""http://store.fatpossum.com/products/baba-yaga"">Baba Yaga</a></em>, one of my favorite albums of that year — nay, of the past five years. (They also have two EPs.)</p> \n<p>Last week saw the release of their third album, <em><a href=""http://www.easysoundshop.com/artist/futurebirds"">Hotel Parties</a></em>, from Easy Sound Recording Co. Here's a track from it, to listen while you read:</p> \n<p><iframe width=""100%"" height=""166"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/215732942&amp;color=ff5500""></iframe></p> \n<p>Futurebirds might as well have been created in a laboratory to appeal to my particular nexus of tastes. Though it may not be obvious given my coastal-liberal-pacifist-commie sympathies, I am a Southerner, born and bred, and the band somehow evokes everything I miss about the South. It puts me in mind of driving down a semi-rural highway in the muggy heat, windows down, music cranked, barefoot, headed out to the river to ride inner tubes and drink cheap canned beer. (If you've ever had that particular experience, I can pretty much guarantee that you'll like this band.)</p> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""4117836"">\n<img src=""https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4117836/futurebirds.jpg""> \n<div class=""caption""> \n<p>Futurebirds, doing their best impression of guys I got high with in college. ""You gonna pass that?""</p> \n</div> \n</div> \n<p>The music is a patchwork amalgam of influences, including: twangy Southern rock (they've opened for the Drive-By Truckers), reverb-soaked psychedelia reminiscent of early My Morning Jacket or fellow Athens residents Phosphorescent, soaring guitar solos à la Neil Young and Crazy Horse, rhythmic jangle from that other Athens band, REM, multi-part vocal harmonies (which every band ought to have, dammit), and, weaving through it all, lyrical slide guitar.</p> \n<p>The idiosyncratic recipe is partially due to the fact that four of the five band members are songwriters and three of them are ostensibly frontmen, trading lead vocals. It shouldn't work, but somehow all those personalities and influences add up to a cohesive sound, though it allows for the occasional off-key or missed note. It's the guys-in-a-room-playing-live energy that I love.</p> \n<p>The songs often sprawl past six minutes, with long, leisurely solos and instrumental passages, though Atlanta producer Drew Vandenberg (Of Montreal, Drive-By Truckers) has <a href=""http://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2015/09/album-stream-futurebirds-hotel-parties.html"">tightened them up</a> a little on the new one (which makes me a little sad — I like the sloppy excess).</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>""It’s less washy and ethereal than Baba Yaga, a little more to the point, both sonically and lyrically,"" said Futurebirds’ Carter King. ""We stripped away a lot of the instrumental excesses and reverb that we have tended to rely on in the past.""</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Hmph.</p> \n<p> \n<script src=""//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js""></script> \n</p> \n<blockquote class=""instagram-media"" data-instgrm-version=""5"" style="" background:#FFF; border:0; border-radius:3px; box-shadow:0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width:658px; padding:0; width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px); width:calc(100% - 2px);""> \n<div style=""padding:8px;""> \n<div style="" background:#F8F8F8; line-height:0; margin-top:40px; padding:38.6574074074% 0; text-align:center; width:100%;""> \n<div style="" background:url(data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAACwAAAAsCAMAAAApWqozAAAAGFBMVEUiIiI9PT0eHh4gIB4hIBkcHBwcHBwcHBydr+JQAAAACHRSTlMABA4YHyQsM5jtaMwAAADfSURBVDjL7ZVBEgMhCAQBAf//42xcNbpAqakcM0ftUmFAAIBE81IqBJdS3lS6zs3bIpB9WED3YYXFPmHRfT8sgyrCP1x8uEUxLMzNWElFOYCV6mHWWwMzdPEKHlhLw7NWJqkHc4uIZphavDzA2JPzUDsBZziNae2S6owH8xPmX8G7zzgKEOPUoYHvGz1TBCxMkd3kwNVbU0gKHkx+iZILf77IofhrY1nYFnB/lQPb79drWOyJVa/DAvg9B/rLB4cC+Nqgdz/TvBbBnr6GBReqn/nRmDgaQEej7WhonozjF+Y2I/fZou/qAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC); display:block; height:44px; margin:0 auto -44px; position:relative; top:-22px; width:44px;""></div> \n</div> \n<p style="" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;""><a href=""https://instagram.com/p/8DuwRoKYef/"" style="" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px; text-decoration:none;"" target=""_blank"">A photo posted by Cleophus James Jr. (@futurebirds)</a> on <time style="" font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;"" datetime=""2015-09-25T15:16:56+00:00"">Sep 25, 2015 at 8:16am PDT</time></p> \n</div> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Sometimes the sound is driving and ragged, like ""Serial Bowls.""

(""Nicki was here, her shirt was not ... she took our show from PG to double D."")</p> \n<p>It appears as though many of these bits were done with Minaj being more in on the joke. And there are heartwarming moments, too. The video of Minaj meeting Sophia Grace, the tiny girl whose rendition of ""Super Bass"" went viral in 2011, currently sits at more than 100 million views.</p> \n<p><iframe width=""560"" height=""315"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/f9573kGBtuE"" frameborder=""0""></iframe></p> \n<p>Basically, DeGeneres and Minaj have had a solid relationship in the past. So why did<em> Ellen</em> reduce Minaj's upcoming sitcom to a single tired, insensitive joke?</p> \n<h3>The sketch is jut too reductive to make any kind of point. Also, it's gross.</h3> \n<p>Some will undoubtedly defend the sketch as playing into Minaj's established persona. They'll point to her revealing outfits and the overtly sexual video for ""Anaconda"" as proof positive that Minaj has made her image all about her butt. So what's the problem with making fun of that established persona?</p> \n<p>But the problem isn't that<em> Ellen</em> dared to poke fun at Minaj's body. It's that the sketch reduced Minaj entirely to her most famous body part. Where the video for ""Anaconda"" was a defiant wink at how people perceive Minaj's body and, indeed, black women's bodies in general, the <em>Ellen</em> sketch doesn't have a single thing to say beyond, ""Hey, did you know Nicki Minaj has a sizable ass?""</p> \n<p>Not every minute-long sketch will brim over with prescient comedy, of course.<em> Ellen</em> has to produce five shows a week, and there will inevitably be clunkers. But a white woman giggling her way through an introduction to a clip in which a black family bumbles around with padded backsides isn't hard to see as stunningly tone-deaf. The only joke is that everyone in the family shares ""unusual"" bodies that are so out of place that they literally can't fit in.</p> \n<p>It seems unlikely Minaj's sitcom will include a young girl presenting her padded backside to a roaring audience as her parents smile and nod — not least because Minaj's childhood was far from rosy. She has <a href=""http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/nicki-minaj-opens-up-on-childhood-abuse-sexuality-19691231"">been open</a> about her father's drug addiction and abuse, which included him setting their apartment on fire.</p> \n<p>Acknowledging the expectations people have of you and being confident enough in yourself to own your image, as Minaj did with ""Anaconda,"" is one thing. Swooping in to chuckle over it as a smirking outsider is another entirely.</p> \n<hr> \n<h3>Watch: Every Serena Williams win comes with a side of racism and sexism</h3> \n<p><!--  ########  BEGIN VOLUME VIDEO  ########  --></p> \n<div data-volume-id=""3320"" data-analytics-placement=""article:middle"" data-volume-placement=""article"" id=""volume-placement-2086"" class=""volume-video"" data-volume-uuid=""ccd35a6e0"" data-analytics-label=""Every Serena win comes with side of racism | 3320"" data-analytics-action=""volume:view:article:middle"" data-analytics-viewport=""video""></div> \n<!--  ########  END VOLUME VIDEO  ########  -->",Music

Also, in case you didn't already feel lazy by comparison, he turned 35 in January.</p> \n<p>In his Cypher rap, though, Miranda reminds us of his roots. He raps about doing his homework ""in the back of a bodega with Abuela / saving up to get a Sega,"" before delving into a litany of his influences.</p> \n<p>There are the expected hip-hop shout-outs to the people whom Miranda credits with helping him build <em>Hamilton</em>'s ""monument to hip-hop,"" including the Notorious B.I.G., Tupac, Raekwon, Dr. Dre, Eminem, Jay Z, and Cypher host Black Thought. But there's also a telling reference in <em>Spic-O-Rama</em>, John Leguizamo's <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/1992/10/28/theater/review-theater-spic-o-rama-making-the-most-of-dysfunctionality.html"">off-Broadway one-man show</a> (1992-'93). <em>Spic-O-Rama</em> followed a family of six living in Jackson Heights, Queens, and Leguizamo played all of them.</p> \n<p>""Have you not seen what we can do?"" Manuel raps in the Cypher, ""I write shows stacked with black and Puerto Rican dudes."" Between his Tony Award-winning musical <em>In the Heights</em>, about Latino youth in Washington Heights, and Manuel's insistence on casting a musical about the Founding Fathers almost exclusively with actors of color, Miranda has already brought more diversity to Broadway than most have in a lifetime.</p> \n<p>Miranda clearly valued <em>Spic-O-Rama</em> enough to catch it on VHS, but thanks to the magic of the Internet, you can watch it <em>right now</em> <a href=""http://www.hulu.com/watch/359600"">on Hulu</a>.</p> \n<h3>Renée Elise Goldsberry: ""Ain't I a woman? / Like Soujourner, I'm the truth""</h3> \n<h3><img data-chorus-asset-id=""4162376"" alt=""renee elise goldsberry"" src=""https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4162376/Screen_Shot_2015-10-14_at_4.50.00_PM.0.png""></h3> \n<p class=""caption"">Goldsberry (<i>Hamilton'</i>s Angelica Schuyler Church), spitting truth.

Diggs's takes on the hyperactive Marquis de Lafayette and smirking Thomas Jefferson have received special notice in <em>Hamilton,</em> not least because of his ability to rap faster and harder than anyone else onstage.</p> \n<p>His Cypher rap shows off that skill, but also his ability to blend and swerve between genres and topics in just a few lines:  ""Ordering orderlies to turn the heat up four degrees / so I can take my shirt off and live out my California dreams / Scribble Thug Life in invisible ink / an umbilical minor chord-clipping metaphysical link.""</p> \n<p>Not exactly <em>The King and I</em>, is it?</p> \n<h3>\n<em>Hamilton</em>'s success is exactly because of this kind of cross-genre appeal</h3> \n<p><span>The Broadway of yesteryear might not have had a place for rhymes like the ones on display in the Cypher, but it's significant that this has now changed with </span><em>Hamilton</em><span>.</span></p> \n<p>While <em>Hamilton</em> isn't exactly the straight ""hip-hop musical"" many have called it, thanks to influences like <em>Rent</em> and the Great American Songbook, it has expanded Broadway's reach beyond its usual audience. By weaving in elements of hip-hop and pop music, Manuel has created a space for <a href=""http://the-toast.net/2015/10/01/race-immigration-and-hamilton/"">those who thought</a>, like Diggs, that Broadway didn't have a place for them — and made a case for Broadway actors having a place where they might not have been before, like BET.</p>",Music

"Watch: Adeleâ€™s haunting, gorgeous video for her new single â€œHello""",http://www.vox.com/2015/10/23/9602234/adele-hello-music-video,She's back and ready to belt.,"<p><span>And here it is: ""Hello,"" the first new music from Adele in more than three years.</span></p> \n<p>The single is a straightforward ballad that sends Adele's voice flying. Following up on her 2011 album <em>21</em>, an extraordinary tribute to a dead relationship with a still-beating heart, ""Hello"" examines doomed love. This time, though, Adele is writing from well beyond the relationship instead of from amid the wreckage. Even as she laments the end, ""Hello"" knows it's just checking in, then moving on.</p> \n<p>Adele's vocals carry the weight of the song through its many repetitions, but in truth, the star of the video for ""Hello"" is its gorgeous direction. <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0230859/?ref_=tt_ov_dr"">Xavier Dolan</a>, a hugely talented young writer and director whose work includes 2012's hypnotic film <em>Laurence Anyways</em>, emphasizes Adele's otherworldly talent with a relatively stark background. The entire video is tinted — or, more accurately, faded. It mourns the relationship even as it luxuriates in its death.</p> \n<p>Dolan's touch makes ""Hello"" feel just a little more tender, a little more bruised than a director with less specificity might have had. The best part of the video just may be the opening sequence before Adele even sings. Dolan's camera follows her closely as she tries to fix up an old house, snapping as she whips covers off dusty furniture, then lingering on the aftermath, almost fond.</p> \n<h3>At one point, you couldn't avoid Adele if you tried — and then she dropped out of the public eye almost completely</h3> \n<p>After such a long wait for scraps of any Adele news at all, this new song and video come to us mere days after she <a href=""https://twitter.com/Adele/status/656787881349009408"">announced on Twitter</a> that her highly anticipated third album will drop on November 20. ""I'm sorry it took so long,"" she wrote, ""but you know, life happened.""</p> \n<p> </p> \n<blockquote lang=""en"" class=""twitter-tweet""> \n<p dir=""ltr"" lang=""und""><a href=""https://t.co/dDImEhKt10"">pic.twitter.com/dDImEhKt10</a></p> \n— Adele (@Adele) <a href=""https://twitter.com/Adele/status/656787881349009408"">October 21, 2015</a>\n</blockquote> \n<p> </p> \n<p> \n<script charset=""utf-8"" src=""//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js""></script> \n</p> \n<p>Keeping in tradition with her previous discography, the album is called <em>25</em>, reflecting her age at the time she made it. While Adele's success comes from her enormous voice and passionate songwriting, it was helped along by some initial shock. The maturity of her albums versus her relative age has always been astonishing. Her 2009 debut album is a soulful tour de force — and it's called <em>19</em>.</p> \n<p>Even as <em>21</em> became a go-to breakup album, though, Adele's personal life rocketed in the opposite direction. She has since had a son with her partner, and has largely kept out of the public eye. Her theme for the James Bond film <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeumyOzKqgI""><em>Skyfall</em></a> (for which she won an Oscar) is, in fact, the only major project she has had in between albums.</p> \n<p>And so<em> 25</em> is inevitably going to be a very different album than <em>19 </em>or<i> 21</i><em> </em>was, a fact Adele herself acknowledged in her album announcement. ""If <em>21 </em>was a breakup album, <em>25 </em>is a make-up album,"" she wrote. ""I'm making up with myself. Making up for lost time. Making up for everything I ever did and never did. ... turning 25 was a turning point for me.""</p> \n<p>In other words, <em>25</em> is a quarter-life crisis album. But if we can believe Adele's near-flawless track record, the singer will find some new, deeply felt way to express it — and ""Hello"" reminds us that she's not done writing torch songs just yet.</p>",Music

With the exception of Best New Artist, it's easy to confuse the other three.</p>\n<p id=""7qS6yP"">Here's everything you need to know to keep these categories straight.</p>\n<h3 id=""kMkpmS"">Album of the Year</h3>\n<p id=""be9JZ4"">The Album of the Year award is the most prestigious Grammy there is, the rough equivalent of the Best Picture Oscar. The category honors an entire LP, from the first track to the last, and everything about the production of the album's sound.</p>\n<p id=""yCL4Us"">Originally, the Album of the Year award went only to the artist credited with the creation of the album, and to the album's producers.</p>\n<p id=""nR9oVx"">But starting in 1999, with Lauryn Hill's win for <em>The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill</em>, the sound engineers and mixers of the album have also been honored, as have any featured artists who appear on the album. If you participated in the creation of the sound of the album, you get a golden gramophone. However, the album's songwriters are not included in this award.</p>\n<p id=""mEuLxL""><strong>How to remember it: </strong>The whole album gets an award! Some people confuse Album of the Year with Record of the Year, since albums used to be on physical records and, thus, the two terms are often used interchangeably in common parlance. But singles also used to be on physical records, and you wouldn't call a single song ""Album of the Year.""</p>\n<h3 id=""JDsxjj"">Record of the Year</h3>\n<p id=""Mfnpr4"">Record of the Year award is often confused with Song of the Year, since both awards go to individual songs. But the distinction is actually pretty simple to remember. The Record of the Year honors, first and foremost, the performing artist. Song of the Year honors the songwriter.</p>\n<p id=""Z9ftyN"">This award is given to the performing artist, the producers, the sound engineers, the master engineer, and the sound mixers.</p>\n<p id=""ZEq3oM"">The Record of the Year award directly correlates with the way song copyrights are created. For every song, there are at least two copyrights: The first goes to the songwriter, and the second goes to the performer. Those copyrights determine how a song’s contributors get paid, and how much they are paid. The people who make the sound of the song (not the words and melody), own the ""Sound Recording"" copyright. Hence, Record of the Year.</p>\n<p id=""SBKgA7""><strong>How to remember it: </strong>Instead of thinking of ""record"" as a physical, spinning record, think of it the product of a recording studio. Everyone who would be in a recording studio working on the Record of the Year–winning song receives a golden gramophone for this award.</p>\n<h3 id=""EwT8gw"">Song of the Year</h3>\n<p id=""80V5jM"">The Song of the Year Grammy doesn't actually honor the performer of the winning song. Instead, it goes to the people who wrote that song.</p>\n<p id=""C18MD1"">It's easy to get this award confused with Record of the Year because there is often overlap in who is accepting the award. For example, if an artist has songwriting credit on their nominated song (a pretty common occurrence), then the artist might accept the award and give the speech.

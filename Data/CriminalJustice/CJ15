Doctors canâ€™t research the health of black men, because they keep getting sent to prison
When the US government banned prisoners from participating in medical research back in 1978, it was trying to protect their health. But the move may have inadvertently skewed decades of medical research — particularly research into racial inequalities in health. A new study in  by Yale's Emily Wang suggests that some of the biggest medical studies of the last few decades may have seriously distorted data on African-American men.  Prisoners are ideal subjects for medical research in many ways. It's difficult for them to say no — particularly for money — and they tend to stick around for the duration of the study. But those qualities can also make prisoners vulnerable to unscrupulous  The system was ripe for abuse. In the early 1970s, reports came out about prisoners who had been exposed to radioactive chemicals or hallucinogens. In the most famous case, in Holmesburg Prison in Philadelphia, one test made a participant's skin change color — in an experiment he'd never signed a consent form to participate in. In 1978, the federal government shut down the prison-testing industry by outlawing all federal research on inmates that wasn't explicitly tied to the effects of incarceration itself, or to conditions that disproportionately affect prisoners (like Hepatitis C), unless the researcher could prove that the research would be beneficial to the inmate. What's more, if someone who was already enrolled in a long-term health study got sent to prison, he'd have to stop participating in the study — unless the researchers had gotten permission in advance from the federal government to study prisoners. Wang's paper looks at several studies that followed subjects over many years or even decades, and compares the dropout rate for each demographic with how likely the dropouts were to have gone to prison at that point. While results varied, she found that studies that were supposed to examine at-risk populations were the most likely to have their data screwed up by mass incarceration. In one major study examining cardiovascular health among inner-city young adults over 20 years, Wang estimated that 65 percent of the African American men who dropped out of the study were probably locked out. This means that the people who  able to stay in the study weren't representative of the black male population as a whole. People who have never been incarcerated are healthier than people who have been, so this is especially problematic for medical research. And if too many subjects are incarcerated, researchers don't have enough data to draw conclusions at all: by the 15th year of the cardiovascular study, there weren't enough African American male subjects left in the study for researchers to analyze racial disparities. Some experts have been   for years that the government change the rules so that, if people start participating in a study under normal circumstances, they don't have to stop when they go to prison. For now, there doesn't appear to be much momentum behind the shift. It's only been a few decades since the government stepped in to stop prisoners from being used as guinea pigs, and regulators are wary. Still, the new  study raises the question of whether it's really ethical to force prisoners to stop participation in medical research when they're incarcerated. It's just another realm in which a vast swath of people, mostly African American and Latino men, are getting excluded from American society. Get our newsletter in your inbox twice a week.

Thereâ€™s a loophole in Obamaâ€™s effort to keep military weapons from the police
  One way that weapons and supplies are transferred from the military to local police departments is through the Department of Defense Excess Property Program, known as the 1033 program, which   to equip specialized units for extreme, dangerous situations such as fighting al-Qaeda sleeper cells or powerful drug cartels. Instead, police departments across the country have used it to stock up on military-grade equipment that critics — including Obama — say is hardly necessary to conduct local policing.   ########  BEGIN SNIPPET  ########   Under 1033, the transfer of certain types of weapons, like tanks and grenade launchers, was . But as the   has reported, there are other, more popular ways for local police to get some of this military equipment — like using grants from the Department of Homeland Security to purchase it. The new rules are significant because they ban

"They can still go to a private armored vehicle company and make a private order," University of South Carolina law professor and former police officer Seth Stoughton told Columbia, South Carolina, TV station  . "The big difference is a fiscal difference — they now have to pay that cost up front themselves rather than getting it either for free or at a steeply discounted rate from the American military." Whether local departments can afford to, or will choose to, spend money on this equipment remains to be seen. The clashes between protesters and police were captured on social media and in news reports, leading many observers to wonder what weapons and supplies that looked like they belonged on a battlefield were doing in the small town, and whether their presence was making an already tense situation worse. Obama's policing task force was created in part as a response to these criticisms and what the events in Ferguson meant for other communities around the country. As the  's David Nakamura and Wesley Lowery put it, "   ########  BEGIN SNIPPET  ########   But there's more to it than just feelings. As Vox's    in the midst of the Ferguson protests last August,  The  contains recommendation for police that include "minimizing t A theme discussed under the heading "Building trust and legitimacy" is the embrace of what the group calls "a guardian — rather than a warrior" approach. The following quote from the report, by task force member Susan Raher, explains what that means: In 2012, we began asking the question, "Why are we training police officers like soldiers?" Although police officers wear uniforms and carry weapons, the similarity ends there. The missions and rules of engagement are completely different. The soldier's mission is that of a warrior: to conquer. The rules of engagement are decided before the battle. The police officer's mission is that of a guardian: to protect. The rules of engagement evolve as the incident unfolds. Soldiers must follow orders. Police officers must make independent decisions. Soldiers come into communities as an outside, occupying force. Guardians are members of the community, protecting from within. Another more concrete recommendation had to do with the use of social media. The task force suggested that it could be harnessed to fight crime directly, as well as to get a sense of how community members felt about issues: Another technology relatively new to law enforcement is social media. Social media is a communication tool the police can use to engage the community on issues of importance to both and to gauge community sentiment regarding agency policies and practices. Social media can also help police identify the potential nature and location of gang and other criminal or disorderly activity such as spontaneous crowd gatherings. It turns out that while all of the agencies the task force surveyed had websites, many didn't have a presence at all on Facebook or Twitter:

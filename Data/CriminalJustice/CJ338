The Senate has reached a deal on its bill to combat human trafficking
  The Justice for Victims of Human Trafficking Act long seemed set for easy passage — who would want to vote against a bill cracking down on sex traffickers? But controversy over one provision of the bill blocking federal funding for abortions held things up — and blocked Senate business, including a confirmation vote for attorney general nominee Loretta Lynch, for weeks. The bill is designed to improve US enforcement of anti-trafficking laws, more strongly penalize offenders, and help the victims of trafficking crimes. According to the  , the bill would: But there's one more thing: that new fund for trafficking victims? None of its money can be spent on abortion or health coverage that includes abortion services, except in cases of rape, incest, or risk to the life of the mother. And a controversy over this derailed the effort for weeks. ,   ,   Watch Jon Stewart's take on the controversy above. Republicans maintained that the abortion provision was perfectly ordinary. They argued it simply reflects the existing Hyde Amendment, versions of which have regularly been attached to yearly appropriations bills for decades. The Hyde Amendment blocks federal funds from being used for abortion except in cases of rape, incest, or danger to the mother's life. But most Democrats say they were unaware the provision was even in this year's version of the anti-trafficking bill. Democrats initially said the GOP   on them, but a staffer's mistake seems to have been at fault. A spokesperson for Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN)   that one of her aides was aware of the new provision but  Whatever the reason, in February the bill   the Senate Judiciary Committee unanimously, and seemed headed for likely passage. But by mid-March, pro-choice groups finally   and began raising an outcry. Nearly all Democrats took up their banner, successfully  to filibuster the bill.                     Democrats and pro-choice groups argued that abortion access for trafficking victims was particularly important considering the sexual nature of many of these crimes. "The majority of human trafficking victims are women and girls, and they need access to the full range of reproductive health care services without barriers," Planned Parenthood president   in a statement. Democrats   that since the anti-trafficking bill isn't an appropriations bill, it would in fact be an expansion of how the Hyde Amendment has traditionally been adopted — it would be applied to a new pot of money (the fines on trafficking criminals) rather than traditional federal appropriations (which are funded mainly through taxpayer dollars). They also complained that the Hyde language would apply to this program for five years, rather than having to be renewed every year, as is currently the custom for appropriations bills. So for weeks, both sides were in a standoff. Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-TX)   removing the Hyde language "looks like we are not maintaining the status quo; it looks like it's an erosion." Democrats are similarly reluctant to cave. "Over the years, we have lost virtually every battle that has been on this floor, and we are tired of it. So we are taking a stand, and we are going to hold that stand,"  . "Once advocates on both sides became actively engaged in this, it is difficult for either side to make a change," Sen. Chris Coons (D-DE) told  . Functionally, the final deal gives Republicans what they want, and includes the Hyde Amendment language for health services for trafficking victims. But it does so in a way that lets Democrats claim victory in one area — it uses existing appropriated funds to pay for these health services, rather than new money coming from criminal fines. A contrast between the two versions shows what's changed: So, practically, the bill will not let trafficking victims have access to federally funded abortions (except in cases of rape, incest, or danger to the life of the mother). But Democrats get to claim that they prevented the GOP from "expanding" the Hyde precedent. Overall, despite the changeover to Republican leadership, it's clear that the upper chamber remains intensely polarized and dysfunctional, unable to get seemingly uncontroversial things done without great effort.

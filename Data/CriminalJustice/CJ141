This Twitter account tweets the names of black people shot by police
Police are   to shoot black teens than white teens. More than two months after  , protesters in Ferguson, Missouri, and around the country are still taking to the streets and social media to remind America that these disparities are far from resolved. As part of what's being calledÂ  , activists from October 10 to 13 renewed protests in the St. Louis suburb to highlight "the epidemic of police violence facing Black and Brown communities." At the same time, civil rights organization Color of Change launched a new Twitter account,  , to tweet the names of black people killed by police. "Mike Brown was one of many Black folks killed by police each year," the organization  . "According to the FBI, local police kill Black people at least two times a week, on average. But other estimates put that number to around once per day. Police departments are   to report these killings to the FBI or other federal agencies, meaning there could be hundreds that go unreported each year." The account has already posted dozens of names since its October 10 launch, and it plans to continue to do so for at least one week. Here are a few examples: Dakota Bright - 15, killed by Chicago PD on 11/11/2012     via    Kendrec McDade - 19, killed by Pasadena PD on 03/24/2012     via    Rondre Hornbeak - 38, killed by Ardmore PD on 08/24/2014     via    Get our newsletter in your inbox twice a week.

From low-rated (but excellent) cable dramas to some of TV's biggest hits, this fall has something for everyone When most people talk about "fall TV," they're talking about   that networks — broadcast, cable, and streaming — put on the air between September and November. But fall also means the return of some of TV's best — or at least most entertaining — shows.   ########  BEGIN SNIPPET  ########   This fall might be  , but it's positively stuffed with great returning shows. Below are 23 we think are worth watching, organized by return date. Some are among TV's best. Some are just shows we like keeping up with.

But when it's on, it's a fascinating, surprisingly realistic look at trying to live a life post-addiction. And even when it's off, it's trying so many interesting things that you'll never get bored.

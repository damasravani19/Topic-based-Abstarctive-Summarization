Rape culture isnâ€™t a myth. Itâ€™s real, and itâ€™s dangerous.
There's a phrase you are increasingly likely to encounter when reading or discussing stories about sexual assault: "rape culture." It might sound like just another way to talk about high-profile rape scandals, sexual assault at colleges or in the military, or accusations against powerful people such as  ,  ,  , or  . Or the   around   about UVA's handling of rapes on campus. But those crimes aren't rape culture, they're products of it. What follows is a primer on rape culture: what it means, how it works, where it comes from, why awareness of it is now entering the mainstream, and how it drives injustices that go well beyond rape itself.   
 Women march in a 2012  And although rape culture has its roots in long-standing patriarchal power structures that were designed to benefit men, today's rape culture burdens men too — for instance, by ignoring the fact that men can be victims of rape and sexual assault, and women can be perpetrators of it. That means that male victims are also left without legal protection and social support. The term "rape culture" was originally coined in the 1970s. The term appeared in  , published by the New York Radical Feminists Collective in 1974, and was explored in depth in the 1975 documentary  . In more recent years, however, the idea of rape culture has received much more attention, including from mainstream outlets:

Sites such as  ,  ,  ,  , and   published essays identifying and analyzing different aspects of rape culture. Their success amplified the voices of feminist writers covering the subject and eventually attracted the attention of mainstream publications as well. At the same time, awareness campaigns run by groups like   and   have compounded that effect, bringing the issue to greater prominence.

This pattern takes many forms. The classic example is when an observer (or a rapist) blames the rape victim for attracting the rapist's attention by wearing revealing clothing. In 2011, for instance, a Toronto police officer sparked the global "Slutwalk" protest movement when he   that "women should avoid dressing like sluts in order not to be victimized." Another form of this argument is the " " lecture often given to young female college students, advising them to avoid drinking or attending fraternity parties lest they become one of the one-in-five young women who is sexually assaulted by the time she graduates. Although that advice is couched in terms of "personal responsibility" and "staying safe," it's still putting the onus of preventing rape on the potential victims.   
 Data Source:  ,  The impunity isn't limited to the legal system. Schools, universities, and the military routinely fail to address sexual assaults within their institutions. All of these institutional failures are magnified by social pressure on victims to stay silent and by patterns of blaming or ostracizing victims who do come forward. There was a good reason for that: the service members who did report being assaulted often faced retaliation from their superiors, who had control over whether their cases could proceed. For example,   reported the story of one soldier who was raped by a superior in Iraq and reported the assault, but was told that she would be charged with adultery if she pursued her complaint. She endured further threats and retaliation before being "medically retired" in 2012. The result of all this, unsurprisingly, is an environment in which rape is common, victims are silenced, and rapists are not punished. But there is a less obvious, more pernicious consequence as well: rape culture polices women's lives, constraining their freedom and limiting their opportunities. When the burden of avoiding sexual assault is placed on women, that essentially grants sexual predators the power to set the boundaries on women's lives. Those who don't are held responsible for their own fate. Sometimes sexual threats and violence are overtly used to police women's behavior, such as when rape threats are used as a tool to silence female writers and activists. The online threats leveled against women like feminist media critic   and blogger and programmer   are good examples of this. An even more brutal form of this behavior is " ," in which lesbians and gay men are raped in an attempt to force them to become straight. 
 
 But often it's more subtle. Much of the advice given to women about how to avoid sexual assault is really just a laundry list of things, people, places, and situations to avoid. Alcohol. Men's homes. Solo travel. One-on-one meetings with potential professional mentors who are male. Over time, those limitations add up, making rape culture a  .

 Lord Matthew Hale really has a lot to answer for  Rape culture didn't come out of nowhere. It's the direct continuation of centuries of patriarchal power and the institutions that developed to support it. When the US was founded, the powers that be — which is to say, men — constructed a system in which women's rights were legally and socially subordinate to men's. While justifications for this system were often couched in morality and tradition and the need to "protect" women, in implementation they were all about male power over women. While we think of those institutions as long-gone, if you listen to way that rape is discussed you will hear the exact same patterns — right up to the admission that this is actually about power, often expressed as a fear of giving women the ability to put men in jail on their word alone. History is full of instances of men wringing their hands about how scary it was to give women that kind of power. "Rape...is an accusation easily to be made and hard to be proved, and harder to be defended by the party accused, tho never so innocent," warned British jurist Lord Hale in 1680.  His concern took root and flourished in the US justice system. In one famous 18th-century rape trial, the defense attorney warned the jury that the rape charge "placed the life of a citizen in the hands of a woman." (The "citizen" in question, Harry Bedlow, was acquitted.) In 1842, another judge warned that, in rape cases, "there is much greater danger that injustice will be done to the defendant, than there is in prosecutions of any other character." And just as those fears haven't changed much over the centuries, neither has the solution: to limit men's vulnerability to rape accusations by limiting women's ability to bring rape charges. This used to be done more openly than it is now, but the parallels to modern responses to rape accusations are striking. In early US legal decisions, courts treated rape as a crime against a woman's  , rather than as solely against her consent: a complaining victim had to prove that she had "good character" in order to pursue charges against her assailant. Second, the woman had to prove that she physically resisted the attack; in the words of one   in 1838, "she must resist until exhausted or overpowered, for a jury to find that it was against her will." Many states also required that the woman cry out for help and report the assault immediately in order for it to be a prosecutable offense. And even when those elements were met, women's testimony was weighed against the   of the alleged rapist. That meant a rapist was much less likely to be punished if he had higher social standing than his victim — or if he was white and she was not. If that sounds familiar, it should. Although those elements aren't legal requirements for rape cases anymore, they are still at the core of social attitudes towards rape today. A woman who comes forward with an accusation of rape can be expected to have her history and character subjected to scrutiny. (Why was she drinking? Why was she even at that party? Why did she take a ?) If she did not physically resist the assault, she will be accused of consenting to it, or at the very least "confusing" her attacker. If she did not report the assault right away, that will be seen as a sign that she is lying. And her social status will be weighed against that of her rapist. The higher-status her attacker is, the less likely it will be that she is perceived as credible.

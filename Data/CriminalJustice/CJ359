Americaâ€™s newest crime: cheering at a graduation while black
The primary reason the story of the three misdemeanor charges is making news is obvious: the prosecution of graduation guests for cheering is incredibly unusual and bizarre. After all, they did what most graduation attendees do, and they harmed no one. Henry Walker, one of the Mississippi parents charged for yelling, "You did it, baby!" at the graduation, told a Memphis radio station that "it's crazy to think that I might have to bond out of jail or pay court costs or a $500 fine for expressing my love But when you take into consideration that  , this news can also be interpreted as being part of a larger pattern, under which African Americans are charged for tiny offenses that their white counterparts — or people outside of predominantly black communities — could easily get away with.  This is in part because, as David Kennedy, a professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice and director of the National Network for Safe Communities, argued in a piece for the  , black communities are both underpoliced (when it comes to serious crimes) and overpoliced for petty offenses. Asking readers to imagine what it would be like to live in such a community, he wrote: Then imagine that the cops sat you and your family down and said that they weren't going to do anything anymore except cause you trouble. We're going to double down on the weed and the rest, they say; expect to get stopped when you walk down the street and pulled over every chance we get. You probably didn't know that riding your bike on the sidewalk is illegal, but it is, and now we're going to arrest you for it. If you're not on your own block, in front of your own house, we'll arrest you for trespassing, and if you don't like it you can explain it to the judge a week later when you get out of holding and get arraigned. If we see more than three of you and your friends at a time, we'll prone you out on the street in front of your girlfriends and cuff you while we run a warrant check. We think you're all scum, they tell you, and you get no slack at all any more. An April  investigation offers another example of this: it concluded that Florida police are targeting people riding bikes in poor black neighborhoods for minor — and sometimes imaginary — offenses as an excuse to question what a department memo called "potential criminals." In practice, "potentials criminals" translates to "African Americans." According to the Tampa newspaper, officers have figured out a way to use "obscure subsections of a Florida statute that outlaws things most people have tried on a bike, like riding with no light or carrying a friend on the handlebars." The resulting statistics are striking. Eight out of 10 bike riders stopped in Tampa from 2003 to 2015 were black, meaning they received 79 percent of the bike tickets despite making up a quarter of the city's population.

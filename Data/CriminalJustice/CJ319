Robert Durst, subject of HBOâ€™s The Jinx, arrested for decades-old murder
  Though he has laid low for the past few years, Robert Durst, 71, of the wealthy New York–area real estate family, has been thrust back into the public spotlight.

Though many have continued to believe Durst was behind both crimes, he had yet to be charged in either case.

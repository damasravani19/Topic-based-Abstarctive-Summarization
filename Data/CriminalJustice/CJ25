A simple way for federal prisons to save $2.4 billion
The federal government is contemplating a rule change that could reduce the sentences of more than 51,000 current prisoners — and save $2.4 billion.  first But it's still not clear what will happen to people   in prison who were sentenced under the old guidelines. Will the new changes apply retroactively?  A retroactive change could have a big budgetary impact. The commission's latest   of making the changes retroactive found that the US government could save $2.4 billion. Here's what it would entail: In fact, while the rule change would mean more prisoners got released over the next two years, it would actually result in   prisoners getting released three to five years from now:   In total, the Sentencing Commission says, federal prisons could save 83,525 "bed years" by reducing the sentences of all eligible prisoners. A "bed year" is the cost of incarcerating one prisoner for one year — which came out to a   during fiscal year 2011. So that's a total savings of about $2.4 billion (albeit spread out over many years). Obviously, if some of the prisoners who get released end up committing more crimes, the new rule will have some obvious downsides — and won't save as much money. But the commission's analysis says that isn't likely. When the commission reduced the sentences of crack cocaine offenders in 2007 and 2008, prisoners who got their sentences reduced weren't any more likely to commit another crime than prisoners who'd been released after serving their full sentences. The Sentencing Commission hasn't decided whether to make the retroactive change yet. It's holding a public hearing on June 10 to get the opinions of experts and the public. But the analysis it just released makes a pretty good case that it's an easy way to save a couple of billion dollars. Get our newsletter in your inbox twice a week.

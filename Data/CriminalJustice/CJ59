If two-thirds of the city is black, shouldn't there at least be more black council members? The problem,  , is low voter turnout during local elections in March and April. " This corroborates what Terry Jones, a political science professor at the University of Missouri at St. Louis who closely follows local politics, recently told me via email. He wrote that the city's white residents "are on average older in age and have resided in Ferguson longer. As a result, I estimate the electorate participating in the April municipal elections remains majority Caucasian." Get our newsletter in your inbox twice a week.

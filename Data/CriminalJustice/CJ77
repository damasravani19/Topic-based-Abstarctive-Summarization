Video of St. Louis police shooting raises questions about officersâ€™ story
Video released by the St. Louis Police of the August 19 shooting of 25-year-old Kajieme Powell, just miles away from   in Ferguson, raises questions about whether events transpired as police initially claimed. St. Louis Police Chief Sam Dotson had told the   that Powell "pulled out a knife and came at the officers, gripping and holding it high," yelling  The newly released video begins before police arrive on the scene. A bystander has followed Powell after he took energy drinks and muffins from a market without paying for them, and can be heard chuckling over Powell's erratic behavior. Powell is seen  "Dotson said all of these images were made public Wednesday because he promised a crowd that gathered at the shooting scene transparency and explanations, with many asking why officers didn't use a taser," reported  . A police union spokesperson told   the footage is "exculpatory," or favorable to the officers' side of the story. But the video's release quickly triggered angry responses on  social media, with many asking whether the shooting was necessary. Ferguson protesters and activists derided what they  called a "shoot first" attitude among police. Prior to the video's release, tensions were already high in Ferguson after the August 9  .

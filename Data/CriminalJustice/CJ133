Map: The most heavily policed countries in the world
This is just a fascinating map of the number of police officers, per 100,000 people, in every country around the world:   
 ( ) As you can probably tell, the redder a country is, the more police officers there are per capita. Lighter orange and tan countries have fewer officers; grey countries have insufficient data available. The map's creator, Ramiro Gómez, used data from Wikipedia's   to build the map. The Wiki citations generally redirect to quality sources, such as INTERPOL, the UN, or official government surveys. However, each of these counts may differ somewhat in methodology, so the total numbers may not be precise. Grain of salt. That caveat aside, there are at least two interesting things on the map. First, China has a really low percentage of police officers per capita. The map is based on a 2007 count from  , China's state news agency, which said there were 1.6 million police officers in China. Given China's  , that's about 121 officers per 100,000 people. As the map shows, that's very low by global standards. That speaks to China's enormous population, of course — India also has relatively few officers. But it's interesting that the Chinese state is as effective at repression as it is with so few police officers police officers per capita.   
 A Russian police officer. ( ) Another notable outlier is Russia, which seems to have a lot of police per capita — 546, a little under five times China's figure. That's astonishingly high. But that figure may also be misleading.  . Among others, he notes  Instead, Galeotti suggests, Russia's has actually had a problem with too   civilian police. "Russia's irony," according to Galeotti, is that " Get our newsletter in your inbox twice a week.

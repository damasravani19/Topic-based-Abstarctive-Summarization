California prisons no longer lock down inmates based on race, but there's a catch
It might sound outrageous if you're unfamiliar with prison life, but California prison officials once  used race to determine which inmates would be placed on lockdown when things got out of hand. Now, thanks to a proposed settlement in a civil rights lawsuit, the days of confining all white, black, or Hispanic prisoners to their cells after violent incidents are officially over in the state's prisons. Attorneys for the inmates said these policies — used by prison officials to immobilize large numbers of prisoners while they investigated riots and other violent incidents, often involving race-based gangs — violated inmates' constitutional rights. In the proposed settlement, which was published by the  , prison officials agree to stop considering skin color when deciding which men have to stay in their cells. Instead, they'll weigh other things — like a prisoner's behavior, or his gang affiliation — in what's called an "individualized threat assessment." Under the new rules in the settlement, race and ethnicity can't play any role in these decisions.  While the settlement must still be approved by a judge, California Department of Corrections officials say the policy changes it reflects were put into place in May, and have already taken effect That s According to 2012 reporting by  ' Shane Bauer on conditions at California's Pelican Bay State Prison, the determination of gang affiliation can be based on pretty sketchy evidence —  [if gte mso 9]><xml> 0   0   1   602   3438   Vox Media    28   8   4032   14.0 </xml><![endif]   [if gte mso 9]><xml> Normal   0               false   false   false      EN-US   JA   X-NONE </xml><![endif] [if gte mso 9]><xml> </xml><![endif]   [if gte mso 10]>

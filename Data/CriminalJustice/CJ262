Federal court halts execution of Texas man who lawyers say is mentally ill
The US Supreme Court   a reevaluation of Panetti's mental health state in 2007. The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, which stayed Panetti's execution on Wednesday, in 2013 found him competent enough to be executed. Lawyers argue Panetti's mental health state has deteriorated over time. During his trial, Pannetti represented himself, dressed in a purple cowboy outfit, and called Jesus, John F. Kennedy, and the Pope to the stand. Americans oppose the death penalty for persons with mental illness by a margin of two to one, according to   by Public Policy Polling. Out of 943 registered voters, 58 percent said they oppose capital punishment for people with mental illness, while only 28 percent supported it. Panetti's scheduled execution has renewed a nationwide conversation about the death penalty and mental health issues. "This is a man that has been severely and profoundly ill since 12 years before the crime," Ron Honberg, legal director for the National Alliance on Mental Illness, told  . "It will be a travesty to proceed with this execution." Get our newsletter in your inbox twice a week.

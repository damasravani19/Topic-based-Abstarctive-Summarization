Live-tweeting a prostitution sting is a terrible idea
The police department of Prince George's County in Maryland decided to   to arrest sex workers and would-be clients next week. That's not uncommon. But they   decided it was a good idea to live-tweet the sting as it was happening — which would include taking photos of suspects and posting them on Twitter — using the hashtag  . What's more, the department decided to  , patting itself on the back for its "progressive, and we believe unprecedented, social media tactic." When it announced the sting on its blog, the Police Department claimed it would target "those soliciting prostitutes." After the backlash they received from sex-worker advocates late Thursday, they published a   doubling down on that claim: "Our Vice Unit will target those who choose to solicit a prostitute, not prostitutes themselves." But the photo on the original blog post announcing the sting showed a police officer escorting a woman with her hands zip-tied behind her back — which implied that even if they won't be "targeting" sex workers for arrest, they still may be taking pictures of them. (That picture has since been removed from the post, but the Police Department has not explicitly said they won't be arresting or taking py.) .  take a lesson from   & don't go forward with plans to livetweet arrests/stings. People's lives are in the balance  
 Just catching up on the   vileness. Cops relishing the arrest and public shaming of a vulnerable population harming no one. Sickened 
 I can only assume/hope that   will have similar success, as a PR move, as   did. Everything about it is set up to fail.

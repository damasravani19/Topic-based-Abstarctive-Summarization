Trace the decline of crime in America
Noel B at the blog  . The interactive below lets you trace the incidence of various crimes from 1960 to 2012. Use the toggle at the top of the visualization to switch between types of crime.   Noel looked at seven types of crime: burglary, theft, vehicular theft, murder, rape, robbery and assault. All seem to have peaked during the late 1980s and early 1990s, and have been falling quickly since. The drop was   during the recession, but instead kept going, and in 2012 the crime rate was lower than it's been since 1969.

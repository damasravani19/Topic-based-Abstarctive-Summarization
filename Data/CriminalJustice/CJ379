The show's grit and gore set it apart from Marvel's other projects in that it really delves into human fragility within the framework of its hyper-violent, noir world.

The CW series isn't afraid to be silly — and we're talking "it involves a psychic gorilla" levels of silly — in the face of so many fellow movies and television shows where everything is grounded in reality. It's more concerned with having fun and   fun than with being critically acclaimed. Everything starts with the hero. Barry Allen is cut from a different pattern. He's a superhero who is happy and joyful.

BEGIN LISTICLE SNIPPET   Animated film One of the more puzzling things about DC Comics and Warner Bros.' middling films (with the exception of some of Christopher Nolan's work) and the lack of excitement surrounding the  trailer is that DC and Warner Bros. absolutely dominate Marvel in other geek genres like animation and video games. The animated feature  is a great example. The film is true to its challenging source material — a story where the Flash wakes up in a dystopian, completely messed-up reality where two of Earth's heroes are at war and Superman doesn't exist — and translates it to a weighty, pensive piece of art that even comic book neophytes can understand.

Today, in large part due to Nolan's cinematic interpretation of the hero in films like  , Batman is seen as a dark, brooding antihero. Frank Miller's   was the comic book that crystallized that image when it was published back in the '80s. Set in a dystopian future,  imagines a world in which Superman is an agent of the government and crime is rampant. The series explores the idea of a hero going as dark as any villain. Fear, it argues, can be as inspiring as hope. "I don't remember any covers with a zillion characters fighting with flame and smoke," Batman artist Greg Capullo told me at New York Comic-Con last year. "They're beautiful pieces of art.

In that same vein, Kelly Sue DeConnick and Valentine De Landro's   features a more diverse and realized sense of the feminism and exploitation film tropes we find in  . DeConnick and De Landro's tale is a dystopian sci-fi space adventure. Noncompliant women who don't conform to the whims of a juiced-up patriarchy are sent to an interplanetary jail, and some are chosen to participate in a televised death match, an event meant to entertain the public. "I also seem to be obsessed with that moment when our hero picks herself off the ground," DeConnick told me in an interview. "She's bloodied and battered, but she's not done yet.

Series like the female Thor and Ms. Marvel are big sellers, and the company has made an even bigger push as of late to get more women into the spotlight. That effort has culminated in  , a comic about an all-female superhero team composed of heavy hitters like She-Hulk, Captain Marvel, Storm, and Medusa. These women live in a place called Arcadia, where they make all the rules and call all the shots until one of their own makes a crucial mistake and exposes the fragile structure of this world and who's really in power.

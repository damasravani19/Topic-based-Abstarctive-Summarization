Young adults view the criminal justice system very differently after Ferguson
A majority of Americans no longer believe the criminal justice system treats people of all races equally, according to   from the Public Religion Research Institute. As Mic.com news director Jared Keller pointed out in  , the change from 2013 and 2014 shows the possible policy implications of the August 9 shooting of unarmed black 18-year-old   in Ferguson, Missouri, which led to weeks of   and national media attention in the St. Louis suburb. The shift could also have been influenced by   at the hands of a New York City Police officer in July.   
 The poll's findings apply across the board. While young adults saw the most dramatic shift toward acknowledging racial disparities in the criminal justice system, everyone else — seniors and Republicans included — saw a significant change as well. Notably, a majority (51 percent) of white Americans now appear to agree that there are some racial disparities in the criminal justice system, up from 42 percent just one year ago. It's possible that this is a temporary blip, especially since the survey was conducted a month after the events in Ferguson. Get our newsletter in your inbox twice a week.

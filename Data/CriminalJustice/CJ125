The Supreme Courtâ€™s next assault on protections against discrimination: housing
Right now, courts treat housing discrimination as a statistical question: if the plaintiffs can prove, with raw data, that a housing policy has a disproportionately negative effect on racial minorities or other protected groups, then it's discriminatory and against the law. The Court announced Thursday that it will hear  , in which the state is challenging a federal appeals court decision that ruled its actions violated the  's (FHA) prohibition against  The question the Supreme Court will consider is this: can people who complain of housing discrimination continue to win their cases by using statistics showing the   of the policies — a tactic known as the disparate impact theory that's been a staple of fair housing law — or will they have to do something much more difficult and prove that defendants   to discriminate?

But if the Supreme Court decides to make proof of intent a requirement to win housing discrimination cases, it would essentially gut enforcement of the FHA.

"I shudder to think, if it's been this difficult to eradicate racial segregation with [the disparate impact theory], how we would fare without it," Seicshnaydre said.

Darren Wilson, officer who shot Michael Brown, resigns from Ferguson Police Department
In   with ABC News's George Stephanopoulos, Wilson said he has a clean conscience about the shooting. While Wilson said he felt sorry for Brown's family, he said he was just doing his job and wouldn't do anything differently. In   to the grand jury and law enforcement, Wilson   Brown was violent  throughout the encounter. He said the 18-year-old tried to take his gun  and charged at him through a hail of gunfire. Wilson characterized Brown  as a demon-like,  dead-eyed giant â€” a comparison some have   to racial stereotypes historically deployed by police to justify use of force against African Americans.

Your complete guide to never leaving your house this weekend,http://www.vox.com/2014/8/22/6057493/simpsons-bojack-horseman-review-intruders,The One I Love leads our list of ways to stay in this weekend.,"<p>Let's face it: leaving your house is really overrated. Sure, you probably have to do so to go to work, but on the weekend, when you don't have to work, there's no good reason. So ignore your errands, order a pizza, and get ready to ignore the world! You have two days with which to do absolutely nothing. Let's fill those days up with some pop culture, shall we?</p> \n<h3>Top pick: <i>The One I Love</i> \n</h3> \n<p>There are a lot of indie films about struggling marriages. There are even a lot of semi-improvised indie films about struggling marriages that feature only a handful of actors. But there's never been one quite like <i>The One I Love</i>, which takes a turn in its first act that is best not to know about going in. Suffice to say that <i>The One I Love</i> starts out in one genre, then invites elements of another over for dinner, and the two get along much better than you'd expect.</p> \n<p>At the center of the film — already available on demand but also opening in theaters this weekend — are Ethan (Mark Duplass) and Sophie (Elisabeth Moss), a couple whose relationship is in serious trouble after several years. When the film begins, they're in counseling with a therapist (played with expertly pitched lazy remove by Ted Danson), struggling to go back to the early days of their relationship. It doesn't work. So he suggests they get away for the weekend at a retreat he's sent couples to in the past. And then things shift.</p> \n<p>The best thing about <i>The One I Love</i> is that it understands that any relationship in crisis is less about the actual actions that cause the relationship to enter crisis and more about how hard it is to adjust to the fact that any two people who know each other well enough are going to eventually find their passions dulled. The chief competition for a loved one isn't some other person; it's the memory of the way things were, when you portrayed yourself as just a little bit better than you actually were to catch somebody else's eye.</p> \n<p><i>The One I Love</i> stumbles a fair bit in its third act, when it tries too hard to explain what's ""really"" going on, but for most of its running time, and particularly in its middle 30 minutes, it's an ingenious exploration of how falling out of love sometimes means clinging to old memories long after they're useful.</p> \n<h3>Binge: <i>The Simpsons</i> \n</h3> \n<p><chorus-asset class=""chorus-snippet browser_wide_media"" data-id=""666846""> <img alt=""The Simpsons"" class=""small"" src=""http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/666846/SIMPSONS_KRAFTWERK__hires2.0.jpg""> </chorus-asset></p> \n<p class=""caption"">""Burns Verkaufen Der Kraftwerk"" is just one of many excellent Simpsons episodes airing this weekend.

That's what you'll find in </span><i style=""line-height: 1.5;"">The Invisible Bridge</i><span>, the third in author Rick Perlstein's series of four books chronicling the rise of the conservative right. It's possible Perlstein gets </span><i style=""line-height: 1.5;"">too</i><span> in the weeds in this book, especially since it covers only the years 1973 (the start of Richard Nixon's fall) to 1976 (when Ronald Reagan very nearly unseated a sitting president from his own party). But Perlstein writes so vividly about the world of 40 years ago that it leaps off the page, even for those who didn't live through it.</span></p> \n<p>Plus, his central thesis is fascinatingly teased out throughout. In the ‘70s, Perlstein argues, there was a brief chance when the United States almost had a reckoning, almost realized it was not perfect. And then that mostly went away, in a fashion that affected both major political parties. <i>The Invisible Bridge</i> chronicles that process, and it's unexpectedly riveting doing so. Few authors are as good at teasing out subtle psychological and philosophical shifts in the American body politic.</p> \n<h3>Sample: <i>BoJack Horseman</i> \n</h3> \n<p><chorus-asset class=""chorus-snippet browser_wide_media"" data-id=""666862""> <img alt=""Bojack Horseman"" class=""small"" src=""http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/666862/bojac_s1_003_h.0.jpg""> </chorus-asset></p> \n<p class=""caption"">It's BoJack Horseman!

Will Arnett voices the title character, a horse who was somehow the father on a family sitcom in the ‘90s (think Bob Saget, but as a horse). Now, his career's on the rocks, and he lives with a guy named Todd (voice of Aaron Paul) while working on his autobiography with a young writer (voice of Alison Brie).

And while this show is going to have devoted acolytes, it's no <i>Orphan Black</i>. That show was engaging from the word go, while <i>The Intruders</i> is mystifying from the word go. In the first handful of episodes, it's difficult to say what's happening without reading the press notes BBC America provided, or looking for a plot summary of the book on which the series is based. That might be all right if the characters were involving, but short of a little girl who may not be what she seems, the show struggles in this regard. Still, there are some legitimately unsettling moments throughout, and at only eight episodes, there's always the possibility of a strong payoff.

British man gets almost 3 years in prison for uploading Fast and Furious 6,http://www.vox.com/2014/8/25/6065197/british-man-gets-almost-3-years-in-prison-for-uploading-fast-and,A British man was sentenced to 33 months for uploading a copy of Fast and Furious 6. The judge faulted the man for his arrogant attitude.,"<p>If you download a pirated movie on the internet, your odds of facing serious penalties are fairly modest. But Hollywood studios are becoming increasingly aggressive about prosecuting those who distribute movies in violation of copyright law. An extreme case of this came last week, when a judge in the United Kingdom <a href=""http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2014/08/british-man-sentenced-to-nearly-three-years-in-prison-for-movie-piracy/"">sentenced 25-year-old Philip Danks</a> to 33 months in prison for illegally distributing the movie <i>Fast and Furious 6</i>.</p> \n<p>A couple of factors contributed to the man's harsh sentence. First, Danks wasn't just another guy sharing the movie online; he was the guy who uploaded the original pirated copy to peer-to-peer networks. He recorded the film while sitting in a local movie theater last year. The film was downloaded 700,000 times, which the film's distributor, Universal Pictures, argues cost it $2.5 million.</p> \n<p>Second, <a href=""http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-28896675"">Danks was defiant</a>, even after he was arrested. A few days after his arrest, he posted to Facebook: ""Seven billion people and I was the first. F*** you Universal Pictures."" He reportedly continued distributing the film even after his arrest. The judge who handed down the sentence chastised Danks for his ""bold, arrogant, and cocksure"" attitude.</p>",Movies
"New horror film As Above, So Below: see it or skip it?",http://www.vox.com/2014/8/29/6083785/as-above-so-below-review,"The movie has some effective, unsettling images, but it's also got an essentially meaningless story.","<p>It's a quiet Labor Day weekend at the multiplex, with releases led by the new horror film <i>As Above, So Below</i>, which involves a bunch of young people who head into the catacombs of Paris and find evil lurking (not monsters, just evil in general).</p> \n<p>We've seen it. Should you go?</p> \n<h3>Why you should go:</h3> \n<p>For all of its flaws — and there are many of them — <i>As Above, So Below</i> creates an incredibly pernicious and overwhelming sense of dread. Much of this is thanks to the sound design, which slowly becomes more and more omnipresent, until it's all but blasting the audience by the film's climax. It's a surprisingly effective bit of film craft, and it ramps up the tension at a point when many films run out of steam.</p> \n<p>But just as much is thanks to how vividly cinematographer Léo Hinstin captures the sheer terror of being in a confined space with nowhere to run. <i>As Above</i> makes viewers feel just as claustrophobic as the characters, and much of that is thanks to Hinstin's oppressive use of darkness and tight spaces.</p> \n<p>It also has a surprisingly involving story, at least in the early going. While it eventually becomes a standard-issue horror film, the movie starts out as a <i>Da Vinci Code</i>-style quest for the alchemical legend known as the philosopher's stone. At the center of that quest is a woman named Scarlet (Perdita Weeks), who makes an able, entertaining heroine. She's the sort of character you'll instinctively want to see succeed, which makes the early going — when the film is a more straightforward treasure hunt — fairly entertaining, as these things go.</p> \n<p>Director John Erick Dowdle also has a solid grasp of what makes a creepy image, and there are moments when he allows the film to tip over into complete nightmare logic, like when Scarlet and her crew (including old friend George, played by Ben Feldman of TV's <i>Mad Men</i>) enter the catacombs and come upon some unholy ritual performed by a group of women in heavy makeup and white gowns, singing composer Max Richter's singularly unnerving score. It sets the tone for what's to come, and it sets the skin to crawling.</p> \n<p>Plus, the premise of a horror movie set in the Paris catacombs is so perfect it's a wonder it hasn't already been done 500 times.</p> \n<h3>Why you shouldn't go:</h3> \n<p>Unfortunately, atmosphere doesn't prove enough to save <i>As Above</i>. Sometimes, a horror movie can get by solely on mood, but that requires careful composition and attention to the build of the film.</p> \n<p>Thus, the central problem here might have been to film the movie as a found-footage horror film, purporting to be the footage from a documentary a filmmaker is making about Scarlet's quest to find the stone and rehabilitate her father's reputation. (He was the one who first was obsessed with the stone.) Too much of the film is spent with the characters running from one place to another, their head-mounted cameras joggling along with them, never allowing the audience to get a good sense of the creeping menace at the catacombs' heart. The film's story is one of slow-building dread, but found-footage filmmaking usually works best as a constant series of jolts to the heart. The filmmaking approach and the story are often in direct opposition.</p> \n<p>And, yes, a striking sense of mood is sometimes enough, but <i>As Above</i>'s story eventually disintegrates into complete meaninglessness. The third act hinges on a series of reveals that either pass so breathlessly that they don't get any room for the audience to feel their full effect or don't get the explanation required to make sense of them. <i>As Above</i> wants desperately to have a strongly emotional story at its core, but it doesn't possess the character development necessary to pull it off. Instead, the characters boil down to a long series of mysteries that then get perfunctory answers as the film wraps up.</p> \n<p>And if you've ever wondered in a found-footage horror film why the characters didn't just stop filming, or who took the time to edit all of this footage together, you're largely missing the point of the form, but you are going to wonder that <i>so much more</i> with this film.</p> \n<h3>Final verdict</h3> \n<p><!--[if gte mso 9]><xml> 0   0   1   640   3651   Vox Media   30   8   4283   14.0 </xml><![endif]--> <!--[if gte mso 9]><xml> Normal   0               false   false   false      EN-US   JA   X-NONE </xml><![endif]--><!--[if gte mso 9]><xml> </xml><![endif]--> <!--[if gte mso 10]> \n<style> \n /* Style Definitions */ \ntable.MsoNormalTable \n\t{mso-style-name:""Table Normal""; \n\tmso-tstyle-rowband-size:0; \n\tmso-tstyle-colband-size:0; \n\tmso-style-noshow:yes; \n\tmso-style-priority:99; \n\tmso-style-parent:""""; \n\tmso-padding-alt:0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt; \n\tmso-para-margin:0in; \n\tmso-para-margin-bottom:.0001pt; \n\tmso-pagination:widow-orphan; \n\tfont-size:12.0pt; \n\tfont-family:Cambria; \n\tmso-ascii-font-family:Cambria; \n\tmso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin; \n\tmso-hansi-font-family:Cambria; \n\tmso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin;} \n</style> \n<![endif]--></p> \n<p>If you're a really big fan of horror, this might be worth a matinee or a rental someday.

Do subliminal messages actually work?,http://www.vox.com/2014/9/8/6111847/do-subliminal-messages-work,The real science about how advertisers might mess with your mind.,"<p>Back during the 2000 presidential election, George W. Bush's campaign aired an attack ad against Al Gore's health-care plan that featured a bizarre quirk. Near the end of the ad, the word ""RATS"" quickly flashed on the screen, barely noticeable, before the words ""BUREAUCRATS DECIDE"" appeared.</p> \n<center><iframe frameborder=""0"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/L6pgoqZpfUU"" height=""360"" width=""480""></iframe></center> \n<p> </p> \n<p>Gore staffers first brought it to the attention of the New York Times, which ran a <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2000/09/12/us/the-2000-campaign-the-ad-campaign-democrats-see-and-smell-rats-in-gop-ad.html"">story</a> in which several experts said it looked like an attempt at subliminal messaging. Bush <a href=""http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/americas/2000/us_elections/election_news/923335.stm"">denied </a>it — and the ad was pulled.</p> \n<p>The fracas was part of a debate that's surrounded advertising for many decades: Do subliminal messages actually work? Are we at the mercy of unconscious cues being pumped into our heads by unscrupulous corporations? Or is this all just a bunch of nonsense?</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""right"">subliminal messages do exist</q></p> \n<p>Many psychologists, for their part, are skeptical of how much subliminal messages can do. ""The general belief is that [subliminal messages] are pretty powerful and that they can get us to do all sorts of things that we don’t want to do. But that isn’t true,"" says Ian Zimmerman, who researches consumer psychology and implicit cognition at the University of Missouri–Columbia. (He wrote an interesting<a href=""http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/sold/201406/subliminal-ads-unconscious-influence-and-consumption""> post</a> recently on subliminal messages over at Psychology Today.)</p> \n<p><span></span>However, subliminal messages <i>do</i> exist. And they can influence people in all different sorts of subtle ways. Researchers have been studying them for decades, and here's what we know now:</p> \n<h3>It's not true that advertisers convinced people to drink Coke by flashing messages in a movie theater</h3> \n<h3><chorus-asset class=""chorus-snippet browser_wide_media"" data-id=""687782""> <img alt=""Drink Coca-Cola"" class=""small"" src=""http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/687782/shutterstock_160682723.0.jpg""> </chorus-asset></h3> \n<p class=""caption"">(<a href=""http://www.shutterstock.com/pic-160682723.html?src=963QFmnODsN2nAWJzGSGcQ-1-0"">Shutterstock</a>)</p> \n<p>The popular concept of subliminal messages was shaped by a famous<b> </b>study in which researchers claimed that flashing <span>""Drink Coca-Cola"" messages in a movie theater got people to buy more soft drinks. But this study was actually a total hoax.</span></p> \n<p>Back in 1957, James M. Vicary and Frances Thayer said they'd spent six weeks showing messages on movie screens so quickly that moviegoers didn't realize that they were there. The messages? ""Eat popcorn"" and ""Drink Coca-Cola."" The result? Popcorn sales went up 58 percent, and cola sales went up 18 percent. <span>The effect was stunning. </span></p> \n<p><span>There was just one problem. </span><span>This study was a total hoax, Vicary later </span><a href=""http://books.google.com/books?id=W3aznFeYHc8C&amp;pg=PA402&amp;lpg=PA402&amp;dq=subliminal+thirst&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ON0GiSD5OU&amp;sig=It-Milicwk20SszTrlqbw8VvhpA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Ow4KVIbzBoOmyAScroEo&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=subliminal%20thirst&amp;f=false"">admitted</a>,<span> made up to boost his marketing company.<b> </b>And other researchers were never able to replicate the results. </span><span>Yet that story still lives on in many minds as fact.</span></p> \n<h3>But subliminal messages might be able to influence your drinking habits in other ways</h3> \n<p><chorus-asset class=""chorus-snippet browser_wide_media"" data-id=""687788""> <img alt=""Lipton Ice tea"" class=""small"" src=""http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/687788/shutterstock_181333220.0.jpg""> </chorus-asset></p> \n<p class=""caption"">(<a href=""http://www.shutterstock.com/pic-181333220/stock-photo-kwidzyn-poland-march-lipton-ice-tea-drink-in-a-can-isolated-on-white-background.html?src=6AUVmHki0xH_qAczVnLftw-1-33"">Shutterstock</a>)</p> \n<p>While the Coca-Cola movie-theater study was a hoax, it seems to have inspired a line of research about what subliminal messages can do to make people thirstier. And there have been some intriguing results here.</p> \n<p>In 2002, researchers at Princeton University published a <a href=""http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1559-1816.2002.tb01860.x/abstract"">study</a> in which they subliminally added 12 frames of the word ""thirsty"" and 12 frames of an image of a Coca-Cola can into an episode of <i>The Simpsons.</i></p> \n<p><i></i> Even though subjects couldn't guess what had been added, they rated themselves as about 27 percent thirstier after the show than before it. Those in the control group, who were only shown plain white frames, were marginally less thirsty after the show. The researchers also got similar results using images of a Coca-Cola can and <span>a sweaty boxer</span><span>.<br></span><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""center"">SUBLIMINAL MESSAGES MADE THESE PEOPLE ABOUT 27 PERCENT THIRSTIER</q></p> \n<p>A similar <a href=""http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022103105001496"">study</a> published in 2005 by researchers at Utrecht University and Radboud University in the Netherlands demonstrated that subliminal messages could affect someone's affinity for a particular brand, in this case Lipton Ice.</p> \n<p>Participants who were subliminally primed with the words ""Lipton Ice"" were more likely to choose this beverage when given a choice between two drinks. However, this effect only happened if the participants were already thirsty. In an accompanying experiment, the researchers manipulated people's thirst by having them consume a salty candy. They got similar results.</p> \n<p>Now, remember, these are just two studies. And there are plenty of caveats for all these lab experiments, which I'll get to in just a minute.</p> \n<h3>Subliminal messages might affect our opinions of political candidates</h3> \n<h3><chorus-asset class=""chorus-snippet browser_wide_media"" data-id=""687778"" style=""width: 626px;""><img alt=""Bill Clinton"" class=""small"" src=""http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/687778/119790039.0.jpg"" style=""width: 626px;""></chorus-asset></h3> \n<p class=""caption"" style=""text-align: start;"">Researchers used subliminal flashes of Bill Clinton's face. (Photo by Adam Bettcher/Getty Images for Starkey Hearing Foundation)</p> \n<p>Some researchers have also found that subtle cues in political campaign ads might actually have an impact.</p> \n<p>Back in 2008, researchers at Adelphi University and Emory University decided to replicate Bush's ""RATS"" ad in a controlled <a href=""http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/store/10.1111/j.1467-9221.2008.00658.x/asset/j.1467-9221.2008.00658.x.pdf?v=1&amp;t=hzq19yj1&amp;s=b4e5d80c03191a136084c2ca57da43b5de9bee73"">study</a>. They created campaign ads for an unknown candidate in which the word ""RATS"" flashed subliminally across the screen. That message increased participants' negative ratings of the candidate. Other subliminal messages, such as ""STAR"" and ""XXXX"" seemed to have no effect.</p> \n<p>In a separate experiment in the same paper, researchers showed participants a screen in which an image of Bill Clinton flashed subliminally right before it showed an image of California Governor Gray Davis. The subliminal Clinton cue actually seemed to make independent voters like Davis a little better (or at least hate him a little less). That might be because Clinton was popular among independents. On the other hand, the subliminal cue had no effect on Republicans or Democrats — presumably because they already had strong feelings about politics.<br><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""center"">A subliminal Clinton IMAGE ONLY AFFECTED INDEPENDENTS</q></p> \n<p>In both experiments, researchers also made sure that the subliminal cues were actually subliminal by making people guess what subliminal message they might have seen. Only two out of 272 total participants were able to do so.</p> \n<p>Now, these are just two studies. And it's unclear if such a subliminal message could be strong enough to affect how people vote. However, a different <a href=""http://www.pnas.org/content/104/50/19757"">study</a> published in the <i>Proceedings of the National Academies of Sciences</i> in 2007 did find that <span>after being primed with a subconscious image of the Israeli flag, </span><span>Israelis voted</span><span> in a more politically moderate way in a real election.

One big question is whether the effects of subliminal messages can last long enough to follow someone from their TV all the way to the voting booth.</p> \n<h3><span>None of this means that subliminal messages make us into brainwashed zombies</span></h3> \n<p><chorus-asset class=""chorus-snippet browser_wide_media"" data-id=""687786""> <img alt=""Zombies"" class=""small"" src=""http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/687786/shutterstock_142238938.0.jpg""> </chorus-asset></p> \n<p class=""caption"">(<a href=""http://www.shutterstock.com/pic-142238938.html?src=zo0PIHKiS_oKj22ku9OzDQ-1-8"">Shutterstock</a>)</p> \n<p>There are many caveats to keep in mind with all these studies. <span>For the most part, these studies are performed in very controlled environments in laboratories where there isn't much to distract from the subliminal cues. Real l</span><span>ife, on the other hand, is full of distractions, which means that subliminal messages might get overrun by other stimuli.</span></p> \n<p><span>Also, sometimes the effects in these studies are small</span><span>, even though they're measurable. Oftentimes, subliminal messages seem to be giving people a little nudge rather than overwhelming their pre-existing inclinations. In one study, subconscious political messages only worked on political independents, and messages about Lipton Ice only worked on people who were already thirsty.<br></span><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""center"">subliminal messages ARE giving people a little nudge, NOT overwhelming their MOTIVATIONS</q></p> \n<p>Also, it's unclear how long the effects of subliminal messages actually last. Most studies look for effects within a few minutes or hours — and haven't explored longer time points. For example, one<a href=""http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com.ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/doi/10.1111/j.1559-1816.2012.00985.x/abstract""> study </a>showed that being subliminally primed with winning-jackpot images increased people's willingness to bet, but the effect only lasted less than five minutes.</p> \n<p>So altogether, it's unclear how much of this subliminal priming stuff would still hold up in daily life, outside of the laboratory.</p> \n<p>As far as subliminal advertising is concerned, it's probably not worth the investment. Zimmerman says it's unlikely that advertisers are using it in the US today. ""I don't think there’s any evidence to suggest that it’s more effective than just a traditional ad that we’re very aware of,"" he says. ""W<span>hy go to the trouble?""</span></p> \n<h3>Still, psychologists do use subliminal priming as a tool to understand the unconscious mind</h3> \n<p>Subliminal messages can also be useful for research. Subliminal <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priming_(psychology)"">priming studies</a> are common these days — not just to test subliminal messages themselves, but actually as a research tool in psychology.</p> \n<p>Here's how it works.

"Why Braveheart is wrong about Scottish history, in 3 clips",http://www.vox.com/2014/9/14/6127883/why-braveheart-is-a-terrible-way-to-understand-the-scottish,"Is the Scottish independence referendum inspiring you to re-watch Braveheart? Go ahead, but don't expect it to teach you anything about Scotland.","<p>The <a href=""http://www.vox.com/vox_entries/preview/5891924"">Scottish independence referendum</a> on September 18 is fast approaching. The most prominent cultural touchstone for Scottish separatism is Mel Gibson's 1995 epic <i>Braveheart</i>, about William Wallace's 13th-century campaign against British rule, so it's unsurprising that the film is enjoying some <a href=""http://www.ifc.com/fix/2014/09/15-things-you-probably-didnt-know-about-braveheart"">renewed attention</a> in the run-up to the vote.</p> \n<p>If you're inspired by current events to dust off your copy of the Oscar-winner, be warned: you won't learn anything about Scottish history. In fact, the current struggle for Scottish independence has about as much to do with the events depicted in <i>Braveheart</i> as America's ongoing racial struggles have to do with the events depicted in <i>Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter</i>. That is to say, there may be some similarities in theme and audience, but the Hollywood epic is too thoroughly fictionalized to offer much in the way of insight. <span>Too bad there's not a better movie for headline writers to reference in the run up to this potentially historic vote.</span></p> \n<p>Here are just some of the many ways that Braveheart flubbed the story.</p> \n<h3>Scotland's nobles didn't meet in 1280 to choose their king, and the English didn't massacre them immediately afterward</h3> \n<p><iframe frameborder=""0"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/zApQRWFNo_k"" height=""315"" width=""560""></iframe></p> \n<p>Braveheart opens in 1280, with a scene of nobles gathering to choose a new king, after the previous king, Alexander III had died. After they select a new ruler, they are surprised by the army of England's King Edward I and slaughtered en masse. Dramatically, this works well. It sets up the English as treacherous and explains why Wallace (who, in the movie, is a young boy during the massacre and witnesses the death of his father and brother) would believe English rule is illegitimate.</p> \n<p>However, it's completely historically inaccurate. Alexander III was still alive in 1280, as was his granddaughter Margaret, the ""Maid of Norway,"" who was his heir. (Alexander died in 1286 after falling from his horse, and Margaret died in 1290, while traveling back to Scotland to be crowned queen.)</p> \n<p>And although Edward I did mediate Scottish nobles' dispute over the throne following Alexander and Margaret's deaths, he didn't lure everyone to a meeting and massacre them — he selected a king.</p> \n<p><b> </b></p> \n<h3>When Wallace led his rebellion, the Scottish king was still alive</h3> \n<p><chorus-asset class=""chorus-snippet browser_wide_media"" data-id=""695670""> <img alt=""Cropped Balliol Image"" class=""small"" src=""http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/695670/cropped_balliol.0.png""> </chorus-asset></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Drawing of John Balliol, the Scottish king who was deposed in 1296, and his wife.(<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Balliol#mediaviewer/File:SetonArmorialJohnBalliolAndWife.jpg"">Torstein</a>)</p> \n<p>England's King Edward I, known as ""Longshanks,"" took the throne of Scotland in 1296.</p> \n<p>Because Margaret died before she could take the crown, Scotland's nobles asked Edward to arbitrate their various claims to the throne and select a king. He chose John Balliol, who became king in 1292. However, in 1296, Edward had a change of heart, and decided that the correct answer was ""myself."" He forced Balliol to abdicate, and took the throne.</p> \n<p>The real William Wallace began his rebellion about a year later, in 1297. That makes it a bit peculiar that he says in the movie that ""if we win, we can have what none of us have ever had before - a country of our own."" That's an awfully short memory.</p> \n<p><b> </b></p> \n<h3>Wallace didn't have an affair with Princess Isabella</h3> \n<p><iframe width=""560"" height=""315"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/sa8E_rZcXho?list=PL26BF9109756D29DA"" frameborder=""0""></iframe></p> \n<p>In the film, Edward I sends his daughter-in-law, Princess Isabella, to negotiate with Wallace, but she falls in love with the charming rebel instead. It is implied that she conceived his child during an affair that took place right before the Battle of Falkirk, which would mean that Wallace's bloodline took the English throne.</p> \n<p>In reality, Isabella , the daughter of King Philip IV of France, was born in 1295 or 1296. She would have been about 3 years old at the time of the Battle of Falkirk, and she did not marry Edward II and come to England until 1308.</p> \n<p>So the theory that Isabella had an affair with Wallace and that Wallace was the true father of Edward III, suffers from some significant flaws. Professor <a href=""https://www.uoguelph.ca/history/history-elizabeth-ewan"">Elizabeth Ewan</a>, a historian at the University of Guelph, noted in a 1995 article that, ""since the real Edward III was born seven years after Wallace's execution, and Isabella first came to England for her marriage three years after Wallace's death, this scenario may not gain wide acceptance among historians.""</p> \n<h3>There's no evidence that English nobles were taking Scottish maidens' virginity on their wedding nights</h3> \n<p><iframe frameborder=""0"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/xxNA9TMMyk0"" height=""315"" width=""560""></iframe></p> \n<p>To firmly establish the English as villains, Braveheart also shows Edward I granting English nobles the right of ""primo nocta"" in Scotland, an entitlement to take maidens' virginity on their wedding nights.  One scene, in which a preening English lord interrupts a wedding and threatens the life of the groom in order to force his young bride to submit to kidnapping and rape, drives home the message that the English were brutes who needed to be forced out of Scotland.</p> \n<p>However, the supposed tradition of ""primo nocta"" (also sometimes called ""jus primae noctis"" or ""droit du seigneur"") is just a myth. Although it pops up in literature with some frequency, there's no evidence that it was ever a real phenomenon, or that Edward I ever used it to subdue Scotland.</p>",Movies

Here are the ones that stood out.</p> \n<h3>Here are 5 films critics loved</h3> \n<h3>1) The Theory of Everything</h3> \n<p><i>Release date: November 2014</i></p> \n<p>Eddie Redmayne stars as a young Stephen Hawking, and his performance has earned positive reviews from most critics, including <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://variety.com/2014/film/reviews/toronto-film-review-the-theory-of-everything-1201300258/"">Variety</a> and <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/theory-everything-toronto-review-730837"">Hollywood Reporter</a>. Redmayne's performance ""towers,"" writes <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/sep/07/theory-of-everything-review-hawking-eddie-redmayne"">The Guardian</a>:</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>This is an astonishing, genuinely visceral performance which bears comparison with Daniel Day-Lewis in My Left Foot. His Hawking starts askew — the glasses, maybe the shoulders a touch — and over the course of two hours contorts and buckles into a figure at once instantly familiar and fresh. This is more than just skillful impersonation — it's inhabitation. To look on as his face and body distort is to feel, yourself, discomforted, even queasy.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<h3>2) The Imitation Game</h3> \n<p><i>Release date: November 21, 2014</i></p> \n<p>Be<span>cause TIFF isn't a competitive festival, the only awards handed out are People's Choice Awards. </span><span>The highest of these honors, which are determined based on audience ratings, went to Morten Tydlum's </span><i style=""line-height: 1.5;"">The Imitation Game</i><span>, starring Benedict Cumberbatch as gay British mathematician Alan Turing, the man who was an important early figure in the development of the computer. Everything Cumberbatch touches turns to gold, and this film is no exception. </span></p> \n<p>From the <i>Hollywood Reporter</i>:</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>Engrossing, nicely textured and sadly tragic, <i>The Imitation Game </i>is overly reluctant to dive into the nitty gritty of how the man who's often called the father of artificial intelligence accomplished what he did, while the matter of his eventual arrest for homosexuality provides a potent and topical framing device.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<h3>3) Phoenix</h3> \n<p><i>Acquired by Sundance Selects after TIFF premiere, but a US release date has not been announced</i></p> \n<p>The synopsis of <i>Phoenix</i> is certainly grabbing: ""A concentration-camp survivor (Nina Hoss) searches ravaged postwar Berlin for the husband who might have betrayed her to the Nazis."" Writing for the <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.avclub.com/article/toronto-2014-day-three-german-masterwork-and-great-208934"">AV Club</a>, <span>Ignatiy Vishnevetsky said it was the best film he saw at 2014's TIFF. </span></p> \n<p>""<i>Phoenix</i>,"" writes <a href=""http://www.flickeringmyth.com/2014/09/tiff-2014-review-phoenix-2014.html"" target=""_blank"">Trevor Hogg</a>, ""is a slow-burn which allows the action to unfold rather than force plot points at certain time frames.""</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>Filmmaker Christian Petzold (The State I Am In) has crafted carefully composed shots and gradually shows the reconstructed face as it begins to heal. There is no sense of hurry; however, the plot always seems to be going forward. The twist on the Pygmalion (1938) storyline adds a level of intrigue, and the final scene is priceless for the reaction of the various characters as Phoenix reaches its climatic conclusion on a high note.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<h3>4) Foxcatcher</h3> \n<p><i>Release date: November 14, 2014</i></p> \n<p><a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/foxcatcher-review-surefire-oscar-contender-starring-channing-tatum-201489"" style=""line-height: 1.5;"">Us Weekly</a> called <i>Foxcatcher </i>""a surefire Oscar contender,"" and that's probably right. The film, which originally premiered at Cannes, is about the 1996 murder of former Olympics wrestler Dave Schultz, played by Mark Ruffalo. <i>Foxcatcher</i> also stars Channing Tatum as Schultz's brother and Steve Carrell as multimillionaire coach John du Pont.</p> \n<p>""Rarely onscreen,"" writes <a href=""http://variety.com/2014/film/reviews/cannes-film-review-foxcatcher-1201185646/"" target=""_blank"">Variety</a>, ""has the art of wrestling, centered around the violent yet intimate spectacle of men's bodies in furious collision, provided so transfixing a metaphor for the emotional undercurrents raging beneath the surface.""</p> \n<p><span>Here's how </span><i style=""line-height: 1.5;""><a href=""http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/09/12/foxcatcher-review""><i style=""line-height: 1.5;"">IGN</i></a></i><span> reviews it:</span></p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>There's no fluff in <a title=""Foxcatcher"" href=""http://www.ign.com/movies/foxcatcher"">Foxcatcher</a>. It's bleak by design, dense, and, at times, intentionally impenetrable. Rob Simonsen's delicate score strings an elegy across a Hell of dampened interiors and blue-hued vistas. Tatum and Ruffalo entangle on the wrestling mat, stand up and shake hands afterward, but their fight never ends. When they step on to the grounds of Foxcatcher Farms, they enter John du Pont's cult, become his pawns. There's not a hint of fantasy in Foxcatcher and it's still the scariest monster movie of the year.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<h3>5) Still Alice</h3> \n<p><i>Release date: Fall 2014</i></p> \n<p><i>Still Alice</i> stars the always captivating Julianne Moore as a college professor diagnosed with early-onset Familial Alzheimer's. <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/toronto-film-festival/11087346/Still-Alice-Toronto-Film-Festival-review-magisterial.html"">The Telegraph</a> called it ""magisterial,"" saying of Moore:</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>Her close-ups are minutely calibrated, even by this actress's celebrated, unshowy standards. The increments of the performance are tiny marvels. It's these that make the precipitous then-and-now of this iBook face-off shattering to behold.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<h3>Here are 5 films critics didn't love</h3> \n<h3>1) Wasteland</h3> \n<p><i>A US release date has not been announced</i></p> \n<p>This film tells the story of a Belgian homicide detective who has vowed to his expectant partner to give up detective work after he solves one final murder. The acting is great, but that's not the problem with this film, as <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.blogto.com/film/2014/09/the_5_worst_movies_at_tiff_2014/"">Alexander Huls</a> explains:</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>The problem is it wants to get to a dramatic place without putting in work like character development, or even basic explanations of why this case unspools this detective. The effect amounts to listening to someone deliver an academic conference lecture on fascism while mispronouncing the word the whole time.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<h3>2) Miss Julie</h3> \n<p><i>A US release date has not been announced</i></p> \n<p>Critics weren't thrilled with <i>Miss Julie</i>, the film adaptation of the 19th-century play of the same name by August Strindberg.

You can't patent movies or music. So why are there software patents?,http://www.vox.com/2014/9/16/6152655/you-cant-patent-movies-or-music-so-why-are-there-software-patents,Musicians don't have to check with a patent lawyer before they write a new song. Maybe computer programmers shouldn't have to either.,"<p>As the courts increasingly <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/9/12/6138483/software-patents-are-crumbling-thanks-to-the-supreme-court"">flirt with excluding software from patent protection</a>, a common argument from software patent supporters is that wholesale abolition of software patents is a crude way to deal with the system's problems. The legal scholar John Duffy is the latest to take this line, <a href=""http://www.cato-unbound.org/2014/09/12/john-f-duffy/favor-good-property-defining-institutions-opposed-bad-reforms"">decrying abolition</a> as a ""brute-force 'reform'"" that has proven to be ""profoundly shortsighted.""</p> \n<p>But the reality is that <i>everyone</i> thinks certain kinds of innovation should be excluded from patent protection. The only disagreement is whether software should be on the list. <span>For example, though you can copyright a specific movie or a song recording, you can't patent the general concept of the buddy comedy or the verse-chorus-verse pop song structure. And hardly anyone wants to change that.</span></p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""right""><span>People shouldn't have to hire a patent lawyer before they start composing a song</span></q></p> \n<p>Notice also that patent law's ban on music and movie patents applies even if a patent's claims are framed as a machine that embodies a particular artistic innovation. You can't patent a CD with a verse-chorus-verse pop song on it. Nor can you patent the process of viewing a buddy-comedy DVD. The patent office and the courts would recognize this kind of patent application as sophistry. The ""invention"" in these cases isn't a new machine or physical process, it's a creative work that happens to be stored in an electronic format.</p> \n<p>And the law's ban on movie and music patents applies no matter how novel and non-obvious the claimed invention is. The problem with music and movie patents isn't that they would be ""low quality,"" it's that music and movies do not represent the kind of innovation the patent laws are designed to protect.</p> \n<p>To many computer programmers, software patents look a lot like movie or music patents. A computer program is a sequence of abstract mathematical operations. The Supreme Court has long said that by themselves such mental steps are not patentable. And just as musical innovations didn't become patentable once musicians started recording music electronically, so software patent opponents don't think sequences of mathematical steps shouldn't become patentable just because a computer happens to be doing the calculations.</p> \n<p>Of course, others disagree with this way of looking at it. Patent attorneys have had a lot of luck re-casting software patents as patents on machines that happen to run a particular type of computer program.</p> \n<p><span>But I think the analogy to music patents demonstrates why that's a bad idea. A big problem with music patents is that they'd be hugely burdensome to musicians. Creating music is an individual, expressive activity carried out by millions of people around the world. These people shouldn't have to hire a patent lawyer before they start composing a song; such a requirement would stifle, rather than promote, musical innovation.</span></p> \n<p>Moreover, patent protection isn't needed for music because musicians are already protected by copyright law. It's much easier to get copyright protection than patent protection, and musicians don't have to worry about accidentally infringing someone else's music copyrights.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""right""><span>To many computer programmers, software patents look a lot like movie or music patents</span></q></p> \n<p>The same points apply to software. Computer programming is a creative endeavor practiced by a millions of people. Many of them don't have the time or resources to hire a patent attorney and perform a patent search. The result is a lot of frivolous litigation against people who accidentally infringed someone else's software patent.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, computer software is eligible for copyright protection, making patents unnecessary to reward software innovation.</p> \n<p>If the courts had mistakenly allowed music patents, leading to a rash of patent lawsuits against musicians, the solution would not be to raise the quality of music patents, allowing only the most significant musical innovations to be patented. Rather, we would say that allowing music patents was a mistake, because that's not the kind of innovation that should be eligible for patent protection.</p> \n<p>By the same token, the only way to preserve the freedom of programmers is to provide them with the same kind of categorical exclusion from the patent system that musicians and movie directors enjoy. Even if we dramatically improve the quality of software patents, it will remain the case that the costs of forcing every programmer to run a patent search before beginning work on a computer program dramatically exceeds the benefits from allowing patents on software.</p>",Movies
6 Rocky movies that explain American politics,http://www.vox.com/2014/10/3/6153527/rocky-politics,"If they ever make a seventh, then we'll really understand this great nation of ours.","<p>Rocky. America. The two are inseparable. And as America is fundamentally a nation built on civic ideals rather than shared blood, any series of films that so intimately ties itself to these United States must in its way be a treatise on those ideals. Thus, study of the Rocky films turns out to be a key way to understand the politics of this land of ours.</p> \n<p>Here are six Rocky movies that explain American politics.</p> \n<h3>1) Rocky</h3> \n<div class=""align-right""><chorus-asset data-id=""2321968"" class=""chorus-snippet browser_wide_media""> <img src=""http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2321968/Rocky_poster.0.jpg"" class=""small"" alt=""Rocky_poster.0.jpg""></chorus-asset></div> \n<p>The original Rocky is the quintessential American aspirational story focused on the notion that all anyone really needs in life is a fair shot. Sure it might look to outsiders like you're a washed-up never-was prizefighter. But given the opportunity to fight the heavyweight champion of the world, you can absolutely hold your own. All you need is strong motivation and a great trainer. This is a central axis of political conflict. Left-wing intellectuals are often very worried about economic inequality. But polls and focus groups invariably show that a message focused on opportunity resonates more with American voters, which is why <a href=""http://www.slate.com/blogs/saletan/2014/01/29/obama_state_of_the_union_2014_why_he_talked_about_work_instead_of_inequality.html"">President Obama swiftly dropped inequality talk</a> from his 2014 State of the Union Address.</p> \n<p>Call it the Rocky principle. A film in which the heavyweight champ easily bests the unknown contender due to a mix of his superior physical gifts and vastly superior training resources would have flopped. A much less realistic film in which sheer grit and determination are all it takes is a classic.</p> \n<h3>2) Rocky II</h3> \n<div class=""align-right""><chorus-asset data-id=""2321972"" class=""chorus-snippet browser_wide_media""> <img src=""http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2321972/Rocky_ii_poster.0.jpg"" class=""small"" alt=""Rocky_ii_poster.0.jpg""></chorus-asset></div> \n<p>Fundamentally, this is a film about America's culture of excessive work. Around the world, the general trend is that in more affluent societies people work fewer hours per year. Higher wages, in other words, lead to both higher incomes and more leisure time. But the United States is anomalous. Despite being richer than almost every other country on the earth, Americans work longer hours than the Canadians, Japanese, English, Swedish, or French. Indeed, <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2014/09/08/nearly-one-third-of-the-american-labor-force-works-on-the-weekend/"">over 20 percent of the population works over 45 hours a week</a> despite clear evidence that these kind of long working hours are <a href=""http://aje.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2012/09/04/aje.kws139.abstract"">severely detrimental to one's health</a>.</p> \n<p>The movie, meanwhile, divides neatly into two parts. In the first part, generally disliked by fans, sad-sack Rocky struggles with life after boxing when a severe eye injury forces him from the ring. In the second, beloved part, Rocky's wife Adrian wakes up from a coma, changes her mind about the wisdom of fighting with a damaged eye, encourages her husband to give it his all, and then we immediately cut to a famous (and awesome) training montage. Everything that happens once Rocky decides that professional success is more important than his personal health and well-being is amazing. The message that this kind of attitude should be valorized somewhat less so.</p> \n<h3>3) Rocky III</h3> \n<p>While the first two Rockies both feature Sylvester Stallone as a white hero facing off against a black antagonist, Apollo Creed is never a <i>villain</i>. By contrast, the third film's James ""Clubber"" Lang cuts a much more sinister figure. And perhaps as a consequent, it's drenched in a much more toxic implicit racial politics. The scene where Lang taunts Rocky at his retirement press conference, for example, is a very worthy successor to Birth of a Nation and other racist archetypes in American film:</p> \n<p><iframe width=""420"" height=""315"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/bF_iiX1HepM"" frameborder=""0""></iframe></p> \n<p>It is true that Creed's reappearance in the film, this time as Rocky's ally and trainer, superficially dulls the racial tension. But the crude parable through which Creed takes Rocky out of his white working class Philadelphia setting in order to teach him speed and rhythm in his old gym in an African-American neighborhood in Los Angeles is, in its way, worse. As David Denby <a href=""http://books.google.com/books?id=4-cCAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA80&amp;lpg=PA80&amp;dq=rocky+3+racial+politics&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=fjkk8Oslfu&amp;sig=VSuj6TcgkZ1fsk_FPduhwDQBORc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=u0AXVIEE0aPIBIaFgMgN&amp;ved=0CE0Q6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=rocky%203%20racial%20politics&amp;f=false"">put it in his original review</a>, Creed ""literally trains him to fight like a black man"" — the only way to even the odds while preserving ultimate victory for America's Great White Hope.</p> \n<p>Mainstream America's problematic relationship with black masculinity, needless to say, continues to plague us to this day with the <a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/mike-brown-protests-ferguson-missouri/mike-brown-ferguson-MO-protests"">shooting in Ferguson</a> and subsequent protests just an unusually salient example.</p> \n<h3>4) Rocky 4</h3> \n<p><iframe width=""560"" height=""315"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/dAUWyYc7Fi0"" frameborder=""0""></iframe></p> \n<p>There are some subtle Cold War themes in this film.</p> \n<h3>5) Rocky 5</h3> \n<div class=""align-right""><chorus-asset data-id=""2321974"" class=""chorus-snippet browser_wide_media""> <img src=""http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2321974/Rocky_v_poster.0.jpg"" class=""small"" alt=""Rocky_v_poster.0.jpg""></chorus-asset></div> \n<p>This is, at the end of the day, the liberal Rocky. Perhaps not coincidentally, it's also the least-popular of the Rocky films. The franchise, at heart, is deeply conservative and the effort to offer a contrary take didn't resonate with fans. The theme, fundamentally, is about the contingent nature of success — all Rocky's boxing prowess and hard work are insufficient to help him avoid financial ruin. Anyone, as this story illustrates, can fall on hard luck. That's the fundamental case for a social safety net.</p> \n<p>But the film also illustrates a more specific policy point. Rocky's monetary difficulties stem in large part from a medical condition that prevents him from boxing and earning further income. But the sympathetic setup also requires that he not merely have squandered previous earnings on reckless spending. Instead, the film posits that an unscrupulous accountant lost all of Rocky's savings on unsound property speculation. Certainly anyone who lived through the great crash of 2007-2008 can sympathize with the story of boom and bust real estate markets. What you might not know, however, is that if you have a 401(k) plan through your employer the people designated to help you plan for retirement have no obligation to dispense advice with your best interests at heart.</p> \n<p>They do not, in other words, have what's called a <i>fiduciary</i> obligation to make a good-faith effort to give you good advice. Instead their responsibility is to their employer — an employer whose bottom line may be enhanced by steering you into high-fee investments you don't need. The US Department of Labor recently decided it might be smart to promulgate a rule changing this, to prevent you from getting Rockied by your employer-based retirement plan, but <a href=""http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/05/28/us-labor-fiduciary-idUSKBN0E81IO20140528"">the rule-making keeps getting delayed</a> due to opposition from industry and its lackies in congress.</p> \n<h3>6) Rocky Balboa</h3> \n<p>A film that demands a reading against the grain, Rocky Balboa is fundamentally a saga about baby boomer self-deception and self-regard. Rocky's gritty determination to get back in the ring at the age of 59 and face the heavyweight champion of the world is admirable. By the same token, there's something nice about older workers' finding ways to hang on in the American labor force over the past fifteen years:</p> \n<p><chorus-asset data-id=""2321930"" class=""chorus-snippet browser_wide_media""> <img src=""http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2321930/fredgraph-3.0.png"" class=""small"" alt=""fredgraph-3.0.png""> </chorus-asset></p> \n<p>But the idea that the old, long-retired former champ could actually go blow-for-blow with a current star athlete is completely ridiculous. About as ridiculous as the apparent belief of older Americans that the Medicare benefits they have or are scheduled to receive soon have<a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/04/us/politics/misperception-of-government-benefits-makes-trimming-them-harder.html?hp&amp;pagewanted=all""> already been paid for</a> by their past tax benefits. This is how we get the fundamental paradox of contemporary American politics. The political party most dedicated to preaching a gospel of steely self-reliance derives a huge share of its support from older people — the very people who receive the most government assistance. Basic conflicts over the allocation of resources are commonplace in politics, but the element of <i>ideological self-deception</i> — the belief that Rocky could stay in the ring with the champ — makes compromise and pragmatic dealmaking unusually difficult.</p>",Movies

Is it legal for the US to bomb Syria?,http://www.vox.com/2014/9/25/6834641/do-the-us-air-strikes-bombing-in-syria-violate-international-law,"The Obama administrationâ€™s legal justification for bombing Syria, explained","<p>Just before dawn on the morning of September 23, the US began air strikes in Syria, targeting members of the terrorist groups ISIS and Khorasan. This immediately raised a question that could loom over the US action for some time: Are those strikes legal under international law?</p> \n<p>The baseline rule is that countries can't bomb each other's territory, because that would be a violation of the target country's sovereignty. There is a limited set of exceptions to that rule, and a bombing campaign has to fall within one of those exceptions to be legal. (It also needs to satisfy all other requirements of domestic and international law, of course.)</p> \n<p>This may seem like an abstract question, but the answer matters. America and its allies rely on these principles of sovereignty to conduct their foreign policy. For instance, the US is currently pressuring Russia to withdraw from Ukraine on the grounds that Russia's actions there violate Ukrainian sovereignty. International law is also incorporated into US federal law, so the legality of the Syrian bombing under US law is, by extension, at issue here.</p> \n<p>Because the Obama administration doesn't have authorization for the air strikes from either the UN or Syria, it's basing America's legal justification on principles of self-defense. Their<span> legal argument for the strikes against ISIS is just okay — it's not one you'd want to rely on if you had any better options, but it'll probably do in a pinch. However, the justification for the strikes against Khorasan is much weaker, and those strikes may violate international law.</span></p> \n<h3>No permission from Syria</h3> \n<p><chorus-asset class=""chorus-snippet browser_wide_media"" data-id=""1400092""> <img alt=""Obama UN Coalition Mtg"" class=""small"" src=""http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/1400092/Obama_coalition_UN_mtg.0.jpg""> </chorus-asset></p> \n<p class=""caption"">President Obama meeting with representatives of other states that are participating in the air strikes. (Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images)</p> \n<p>The US can't claim the simplest exception to the no-bombing-other-countries'-territory rule: permission from the country being bombed. That exception does apply to the US military operations in Iraq, because the Iraqi government invited the US to take part in the war against ISIS there. But it doesn't apply in Syria, because the Assad regime has done no such thing.</p> \n<p>While Assad seems to be tacitly welcoming the strikes, even playing up the (likely false) idea that he is coordinating with the US for the strikes, and the US government did notify the regime before launching the attacks, that is not the same thing in legal terms as official permission.</p> \n<h3><span>No permission from the UN Security Council</span></h3> \n<p><chorus-asset class=""chorus-snippet browser_wide_media"" data-id=""1400088""> <img alt=""Obama Kerry Power UN"" class=""small"" src=""http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/1400088/Obama_Kerry_Power.0.jpg""> </chorus-asset></p> \n<p class=""caption"">President Obama with Secretary of State Kerry and Ambassador Power at the UN.

It's not a crazy case to make, but it's not a home run either.</p> \n<p>Traditionally, collective self-defense has only applied to threats from state actors. However, because this is a customary law argument, its specifics are derived from patterns of state practice, not just written treaties or court decisions, and those can change over time. As law professor Jens David Ohlin <a href=""http://opiniojuris.org/2014/09/23/unwilling-unable-doctrine-comes-life/"">points out</a>, there are indications that state practice is trending towards support for this type of self-defense. So the response to the US action in Syria may end up crystallizing the rule as applying to non-state actors like ISIS. But that hasn't happened yet.</p> \n<p>The argument about Khorasan is much more of a <a href=""http://opiniojuris.org/2014/09/23/collective-self-defense-justification-extend-khorasan-one/"">stretch</a>. Power's letter indicates that the US is acting preemptively against the threat that Khorasan might attack the US or its allies in the future. According to the letter, the US's legal justification for the strikes on Khorasan is that the action is intended ""to address terrorist threats that they pose to the United States and our partners and allies."" But pre-emptive self defense is a doctrine with <a href=""http://opiniojuris.org/2012/03/07/why-preventive-self-defense-violates-the-un-charter/"">very little</a> support among the community of nations, and pre-emptive collective self-defense against a non-state actor is an even weaker legal justification.</p> \n<p>So, in sum: the US's legal justification for bombing ISIS in Syria goes beyond what established law allows, but there is a decent chance that the law will catch up quickly, so that probably won't matter very much in the end. But its arguments for the legality of bombing Khorasan are much weaker, and those strikes may violate international law.</p>",Movies

(About <a href=""http://www.vox.com/cards/marijuana-legalization/-popular-opinion-changing-marijuana-legalization"">58 percent</a> of Americans back full legalization, <a href=""http://www.gallup.com/poll/165539/first-time-americans-favor-legalizing-marijuana.aspx"">according to Gallup</a>.)</p> \n<p>When I <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/10/1/6858173/marijuana-legalization-majority-movement"">posed the question</a> to experts on social movements, they said marijuana just doesn't have the priority among the electorate or kind of fundraising potential that politicians need to take on an issue.</p> \n<p>Politicians generally need a concerted movement ""that will give  [them] time and money and networks [they] can't get otherwise,"" said Daniel Schlozman, a  political scientist at Johns Hopkins University, in <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/10/1/6858173/marijuana-legalization-majority-movement"">a previous interview</a>.

The insane conspiracy theories of Naomi Wolf,http://www.vox.com/2014/10/5/6909837/naomi-wolf-isis-ebola-scotland-conspiracy-theories,The celebrated author suggests that the US government faked the ISIS beheading videos and is plotting to bring Ebola to America.,"<p>Author and former Democratic political consultant Naomi Wolf published a series of Facebook posts on Saturday in which she questioned the veracity of the ISIS videos showing the murders and beheadings of two Americans and two Britons, strongly implying that the videos had been staged by the US government and that the victims and their parents were actors.</p> \n<p>Wolf published a separate Facebook post, also on Saturday, suggesting that the US was sending troops to West Africa not to assist with Ebola treatment but to bring Ebola back to the US to justify a military takeover of American society. She also suggested that the Scottish independence referendum, in which Scots voted to remain in the United Kingdom, had been faked.</p> \n<p>Wild-eyed conspiracy theories are common on Facebook. You may naturally wonder, then, why you are reading about these ones. Partly it's because Wolf's posts on ISIS deeply offended many people who knew one or more of the four murdered Westerners whom Wolf accused of being actors. And as American victims James Foley and Steven Sotloff were journalists, their outraged friends included a number of fellow journalists, so you may have seen them discussing Wolf's posts online and wondered what had happened.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""right"">""it takes five people to stage an event like this — two to be 'parents'""</q></p> \n<p>Perhaps more importantly, though, despite Wolf's turn into conspiracy theory, she is still more widely known for her earlier and much-respected work on feminism, as well as her political consulting for the 1996 Bill Clinton and 2000 Al Gore presidential campaigns on reaching female voters. I was taught parts of Wolf's 1990 book ""The Beauty Myth"" in school and admit that, until researching her more recent views more fully for this post, still mostly associated her with this and other well-respected work. In other words, I was carrying the assumption that Wolf is a respected and authoritative figure to be taken seriously. I can only assume that I was not alone in this.</p> \n<p>Her initial posts on ISIS repeatedly stated that confirmation of the authenticity of their beheading videos ""<a href=""https://www.facebook.com/naomi.wolf.author/posts/10152721913269476"">has not happened yet</a>."" Wolf said that the media was ignoring ""journalistic red flags"" in that the sole source of the videos had been ""SITE, which is run by an anti-Muslim activist with half a million dollars in US funding in 2004."" (In fact, the videos were widely distributed on open-source jihadist online outlets. Maryland-based nonprofit SITE monitors extremist social media.) She also detailed an alleged incident, which I was not able to confirm, of a website ""based in Doha, address registered at a private intelligence firm in the UK"" that she said had spread news of a Canadian journalist, who turned out not to exist, taken hostage in Syria.</p> \n<p>This culminated in a now-deleted<span> post, reproduced below, suggesting that the ISIS beheading videos had been staged, as had the initial abductions of the two American journalists and two British aid workers killed on camera. She hints that she believes this was done by the US military.</span></p> \n<blockquote lang=""en"" data-conversation=""none"" class=""twitter-tweet""> \n<p><a href=""https://twitter.com/penkill"">@penkill</a> Here it is, for your reference. <a href=""http://t.co/H5RxHZEXAp"">pic.twitter.com/H5RxHZEXAp</a></p> \n— Graeme Wood (@gcaw) <a href=""https://twitter.com/gcaw/status/518549774514286594"">October 4, 2014</a>\n</blockquote> \n<p> \n<script charset=""utf-8"" src=""//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js""></script> \n</p> \n<p>Like many other journalists who cover the Middle East, I had previously met both murdered American journalist James Foley and his parents (in my case, in 2011) and can attest, although I deeply regret that it is necessary to do so, that they are not actors.</p> \n<p>Wolf deleted the post at the urging of New York Times foreign correspondent Rukmini Callimachi, who commented beneath it on Facebook. Callimachi, who has reported extensively on these cases, later explained on Twitter (I've cleaned up the abbreviations that are common Twitter shorthand), ""What she fails to understand is that the kidnappings — 23 in total — have been under blackout for much of the past two years because ISIS told families of Henning, Foley, Kassig, etc., their sons would be killed if it became public.""</p> \n<p>After deleting her post at Callimachi's request, Wolf posted again, reiterating her earlier accusations and promising to ""repost"" with ""new reporting."" She also posed a series of questions to the New York Times implying that the newspaper was complicit in fabricating the story. She focused her criticism on the idea that all information on the ISIS kidnappings and videos had been sourced only to SITE, which she again noted had once received a US government grant. She implied that the media had been unable or unwilling to find a second source because the entire story had been staged. (In fact, the kidnappings and murders have been reported based on dozens of sources, including Syrians in the ISIS headquarters of Raqqa and a number of fellow hostages who have been released.)</p> \n<p>Later, Wolf <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/naomi.wolf.author/posts/10152723101654476"">scolded</a> the New York Times for not answering her questions and accused it of failing to meet ""basic j-school two source journalism."" <span>In </span><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/naomi.wolf.author/posts/10152723584039476"" style=""line-height: 1.5; background-color: #ffffff;"">another post</a><span>, Wolf stated, ""I stand by what I wrote today"" about ISIS. She then described a ""Pakistani lawyer who is a fourth-generation scion of a major Pakistani political family"" who had told her that ISIS was funded by the United States and Israel, along with Saudi Arabia. She described the lawyer as a ""credible source"" and uncritically presented his claims as ""the news behind the news.""</span></p> \n<p>In the course of Saturday, Wolf also <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/naomi.wolf.author/posts/10152723629514476"">commented</a> on Australia, where she said ""ISIS hype"" was being used to justify ""loss of freedoms,"" and on supposed fraud in the Scottish independence referendum, including a <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/naomi.wolf.author/posts/10152719501739476"">letter</a> she sent to the Scottish Electoral Commission accusing it of a cover-up.</p> \n<p>She also posted at great length on Ebola, including a <a href=""https://twitter.com/BenMcCombe/status/518493472701952000"">post</a> arguing that the US troops traveling to Liberia were not actually sent to help fight Ebola, but rather to further the aim of a ""militarized Africa"" and because this ""creates a direct vector into the US"" for Ebola, meant ""to justify military condoning [sic] of US population.""</p> \n<div id=""fb-root""></div> \n<p> \n<script type=""text/javascript""><!-- \n(function(d, s, id) { var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0]; if (d.getElementById(id)) return; js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.src = ""//connect.facebook.net/en_US/all.js#xfbml=1""; fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs); }(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk')); \n// --></script> \n</p> \n<div class=""fb-post"" data-href=""https://www.facebook.com/naomi.wolf.author/posts/10152722211314476"" data-width=""700""> \n<div class=""fb-xfbml-parse-ignore"">\n<a href=""https://www.facebook.com/naomi.wolf.author/posts/10152722211314476"">Post</a> by <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/naomi.wolf.author"">Naomi Wolf</a>.</div> \n</div> \n<p> </p> \n<p><span>Wolf's record of respectability gives her a platform and helps advance her conspiracy theories further than they would travel otherwise. </span><span>This is not to argue that all of Wolf's earlier work must be discarded on the basis of these Facebook posts, but rather to urge others to see the broader context of Wolf and her thinking.</span><span> In other words, it is important for readers who may encounter Wolf's ideas to understand the distinction between her earlier work, which rose on its merits, and her newer conspiracy theories, which are unhinged, damaging, and dangerous.</span></p>",Movies

How copyright law gives Amazon too much power over the book industry,http://www.vox.com/2014/10/25/7061603/the-way-to-reduce-amazons-power-in-the-book-market-is-to-reform,The 1998 Digital Millennium Copyright Act make sit hard to compete with Amazon in the e-book business.,"<p>I mostly agree with <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/10/22/7016827/amazon-hachette-monopoly"" target=""_blank"">my colleague Matt Yglesias's argument</a> that Amazon is doing the world a favor by crushing book publishers. But there's at least<span> one way US law gives Amazon excessive power, to the detriment of publishers, authors, and the reading public: ill-conceived copyright regulations lock consumers into Kindle's book platform, making it hard for new e-book platforms to gain traction.</span></p> \n<p>To see why this is a big deal, it's useful to remember how things worked before Congress changed the law in 1998. In the late 1990s, before the iPod, a variety of startups were experimenting with portable digital music players. None of these companies were big enough to get licensing deals with major music labels. But that didn't matter, because customers didn't need anyone's permission to rip the music CDs they already owned onto their hard drives, and from there to their MP3 players.</p> \n<p>This situation was good for innovation — it was easy to move from one MP3 player to another, and take your music with you — but music publishers hated it. They didn't get an opportunity to sell the same music to customers over and over again. They also argued that the ease of copying promoted piracy.</p> \n<p><span>So in 1998 they got Congress to pass the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, which made it a federal crime to unscramble encrypted content without the permission of copyright holders.</span></p> \n<p><span>The law didn't affect music CDs because it was too difficult to add copy protection to the well-established CD format. But all of the major media formats developed since the DMCA passed have taken advantage of the law. </span><span>That's why iTunes won't let you rip your DVD collection the way it will rip CDs. Because DVDs are copy-protected, adding a ""rip DVD"" feature to iTunes would be a felony.</span></p> \n<p><span>And while the law was passed at the behest of content creators, it also gave a lot of power to platform owners. If you buy a movie on iTunes, you're effectively forced to continue buying Apple devices if you want to keep watching the movie. Tools to transfer copy-protected movies you've purchased from iTunes onto another platform exist, but they're illegal and, accordingly, not very user-friendly.</span></p> \n<p>Amazon has taken advantage of the DMCA too. Kindle books come copy-protected so that only Amazon-approved software can read it without breaking the law. Of course, software to convert it to other formats <a href=""http://www.howtogeek.com/162994/how-to-strip-the-drm-from-your-kindle-ebooks-for-cross-device-enjoyment-and-archiving/"" target=""_blank"">exists</a>, but it's illegal and accordingly isn't very convenient or user-friendly.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""right""><span>Kindle books come copy-protected so that only Amazon-approved software can read it without breaking the law</span></q></p> \n<p>And that creates a huge barrier to entry. People who want to create new e-reader apps or devices can't do what MP3 startups did in the 1990s and offer to automatically import your existing e-books from Kindle, iTunes, or other major platforms. Instead, they have to start from scratch, creating their own e-book store and convincing all the major publishers to sign up for it.</p> \n<p>Even more daunting, they have to convince customers to toss their existing e-book libraries and buy new copies of their e-books on the new platform — or split their time between multiple platforms.</p> \n<p>Hence, the DMCA is increasing the already significant market power conferred by Amazon's control of the most popular e-book platform. So if you're worried that the company has too much control over the publishing industry, a good place to start would be to change the DMCA and give consumers the freedom to move content they purchased from one device to another.</p>",Movies

We're dropped into a Cambridge mixer in 1963, and witness love at first sight when nerd-handsome Hawking meets the charming Jane Wilde, played Felicity Jones. And we see how their relationship blossoms, and then how their love bends and cracks after Hawking's devastating diagnosis with </span><span>Lou Gehrig's disease. </span></p> \n<p>Redmayne has the more elaborate role of the two leads, as he tells Hawking's story of physical deterioration with limps, tremors, jagged steps, and broken speech, until all he's left to work with are his eyes. His performance is potent — he instills clarity and emotion, fully conveying the weight of Hawking's life sentence.</p> \n<p>Jones's role isn't made to crackle like Redmayne's, but there's a transformation, albeit a quieter one, there too.

But it changes. </span></p> \n<p>While Marsh and McCarten are thoughtful in plumbing the chewy emotions that constitute love and marriage, the same attention isn't paid to depicting Hawking's work. The scenes about Hawking's science are fleeting scribbles on a chalkboard, cuts of professors declaring his theories garbage or splendid, and some close-ups of milk swirling in black coffee — a symbol of time and space. Hawking's science becomes montage fodder, which is a shame.</p> \n<p><i>The Theory of Everything</i> isn't perfect. And perhaps Hawking's life is too expansive, and his science too burly, to really capture the ""everything"" this man means. But Jones and Redmayne are dazzling, and the things this movie does well are worth watching.</p>",Movies
Hereâ€™s what happens when you ask white people how it feels to be white,http://www.vox.com/2014/10/31/7134247/whiteness-project,A conversation with The Whiteness Project creator Whitney Dow.,"<p class=""s-ecnt-intro"">When Whitney Dow proposed calling his interactive race documentary <em>For Whites Only</em>, he got a swift reality check: he was never going to get funding with a title that evoked the Jim Crow South. He dropped it.</p> \n<div class=""chorus-snippet center""> \n<p>He ultimately dubbed it <a href=""http://whitenessproject.org/""><em>The Whiteness Project</em></a>: an investigation of  how Americans who identify as white experience their ethnicity, through a series of online video clips. (He hopes to expand it to include a public video kiosk showcasing similar material.) But Dow still insists the initial title conveyed an important point: that his work is designed to speak exclusively to, and with, white people.</p> \n<p>That's what makes this project a big deal.</p> \n<p>Aside from standup comedy routines poking fun at disparate cultural norms, or hateful expressions of white supremacist views, we're not used to hearing people speak explicitly about what it means to be white. ""Normal, everyday white people"" — that's how Dow describes his subjects — don't typically spend much time consciously, or publicly, dwelling on their own racial identities.</p> \n<p>""White people think race is something outside themselves, and they don't consider themselves a race,"" said the 53-year-old-filmmaker (who, if you haven't figured it out by now, is himself white).</p> \n<q>""I'm not an activist. I'm a filmmaker. When I make a project it's because I'm interested and want to learn.""</q> \n<p>The first installment of the project, ""Inside the White/Caucasian Box,"" is a collection of 24 interviews with Buffalo, New York, residents who self-identify as white. They respond on camera to deceptively simple questions like ""What is it that makes you white?"" and ""Can you describe any benefits you receive from being white?""</p> \n<p>Some responses are introspective (""I wish I had the feeling of being part of something for being white""), while others make jarring leaps from self-reflection to  defensiveness. Often, respondents seem to unconsciously answer a question that wasn't asked by focusing on black people instead of themselves. (""I just don't buy into the nonsense about discrimination,"" or, ""Because slavery happened, does that mean we owe black people something?"")</p> \n<p>Public reactions to the project have ranged from intrigue to appreciation to dismissiveness to outright scorn, with fans and critics sprinkled unpredictably across racial and political divides.</p> \n<p>According to Dow, who's dedicated the majority of the past 15 years to making films about race, all of this conversation was sort of the point.</p> \n<p>I spoke to him about what he's really trying to do, his reactions to condemnation of the project, and the personal experience that made him want to get people like himself to think out loud about race in a way many Americans of all races would rather not hear.</p> \n</div> \n<hr> \n<div class=""chorus-snippet center features-toggle""><interview> \n<p><span class=""features-toggle-interviewer"">Jenée Desmond-Harris:</span> Looking at a lot of the reactions to <i>The Whiteness Project,</i> particularly on Twitter and in the comments section, it struck me that some people may have missed the point — or at least what you intended as the point. What did people get about the project, and what did they not get?</p> \n<p><span class=""features-toggle-interviewee"">Whitney Dow:</span> I think in some ways the comments section on the site itself is really irrelevant, and I'll tell you why. I think that what's much more interesting to me is that the thing has been shared over Facebook over 30,000 times at this point.</p> \n<p>The conversations are not taking place in public spaces. They're taking place in private spaces where people have relationships. Comments sections on something like this tend to just be like a war, a battleground. I've also I've seen some amazing back and forths on the website where people are really laying it out there in a very real way and actually listening to each other. Of course, I would say 25 percent of it is probably just crap but I have seen … I've been pulling some stuff to show funders because I haven't seen conversations like that take place before.</p> \n<p>I think Twitter is a problematic issue. I think that Twitter is a great place for communicating with people, and I really like it to communicate with people, but it's not a great place to go for considered thought and discussion in a lot of ways.</p> \n<p><span class=""features-toggle-interviewer"">Jenée Desmond-Harris:</span>That's very true. How did you see the message lost there?</p> \n<p><span class=""features-toggle-interviewee"">Whitney Dow:</span> I think at first a lot of people were going to the site, taking a screenshot, and then posting it to Twitter and saying, ""What the fuck?"" But what's happened is I've watched the site analytics, and the longer it's up, the longer people are spending on it.</p> \n<div class=""float-right""><q>""I believe our whiteness is so tangled up in our relationship to blackness""</q></div> \n<p>I think the first reaction is like, ""What is this?"" and then people spend a little time with it and realize that it's much more complicated. I would say it's probably 85 to 90 percent positive and 10 percent really negative. I think a lot of the early articles focused on the negative. Those aggregator articles people would go and just troll Twitter for all these horrible things and put it up and say, ""This thing is getting slammed.""</p> \n<p>They weren't sitting with me on my personal email getting all these really beautiful, thoughtful notes from people and letters from people I had never met before. People from all over the world.</p> \n<p>I think that ... there's two groups that really don't like it, don't get it. One is from the right, on the conservative side, who say, ""Why are you stirring something up? Everybody needs to forget about race and stop talking about it. We just need to move on."" The other side is from the left who are saying, ""You're just another white guy who won't let go of the microphone. You're putting all this stuff out here that's incredibly wounding for us to hear, and it's really, really outrageous what you're up to.""</p> \n<p>The third one, which is my favorite, is that I'm secretly a Jew who is out to destroy the white race.</p> \n<p><span class=""features-toggle-interviewer"">Jenée Desmond-Harris:</span> I think we can pretty much dismiss number three, but how do you respond to the first two criticisms?</p> \n<p><span class=""features-toggle-interviewee"">Whitney Dow:</span> On the right side, I would say, ""You've got to be fucking kidding me."" I'm going to have to stop swearing so much. I’d say, ""You've got to be kidding me. To pretend that this is something that is not a real issue is ridiculous. Look at any set of data. Forget any interview that Whitney Dow does. Go to the census and just do some sorts. What it means to live in America as a white person, see what it means to be living in America as a black person.""</p> \n<p>On the left, I would say, ""You are wrong because this is not a part of the discussion that has taken place: white people talking to white people and examining what it means to be white and what that means. By doing that, it's going to make every discussion that we have more productive because you're not going to be talking to people who think that race is something outside themselves.""</p> \n<img data-chorus-asset-id=""2409124"" alt=""interview"" src=""http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2409124/15014753570_de03a8accd_k.0.jpg""> \n<p class=""caption"">Filming <i>The Whiteness Project</i> in Buffalo, New York (Whitney Dow)</p> \n<p><span class=""features-toggle-interviewer"">Jenée Desmond-Harris:</span> Do you draw any distinction between airing people's opinions and teaching people? Is there going to be a point in this project when you instruct people on how they should think, or are you simply exposing how people do think?</p> \n<p><span class=""features-toggle-interviewee"">Whitney Dow:</span> I'm not an activist. I'm a filmmaker. When I make a project it's because I'm interested and want to learn about something and understand something and the process I use to understand that is to make a film or interactive piece. I'm learning, too.</p> \n<p>But I think I already am instructing the way people think with the piece. I feel like the instruction that's there is … well, to me it's obvious, but maybe it's not. It’s the idea that there's a big disconnect between the ways whites perceive themselves, their position in the world and American society, and the reality of it. That's pretty obvious.</p> \n<p><span class=""features-toggle-interviewer"">Jenée Desmond-Harris:</span> I’ve heard you tell the story about how a child asked you what your racial identity was and you initially said you didn’t have one, and then reexamined that.  Besides that moment, what else equipped you to think about race the way you do now? What made you someone who is interested in making films about race in the first place?</p> \n<p><span class=""features-toggle-interviewee"">Whitney Dow:</span> It was totally accidental. I don't know ... You can put me on the couch if you want. I’ve talked about being  a counselor at the YMCA in Boston. This was in the '70s during busing, and racial tensions were really high.</p> \n<p>All the kids I was responsible for were black and Puerto Rican, and they were 10 or 11. We decided to go swimming one day, decided to go to the North End to the public pool, which was in the Italian section of town.</p> \n<p>We got on the subway, went to the North End, went into the changing building into the bath house. As they're changing, these four or five toughs come in; they seemed like big men at the time. I was 15 and they were probably late teens or early 20s.</p> \n<p>They said, ""Are you responsible for these kids?"" I said, ""Yes."" They said, ""You know, we just want to be really clear about something. If any of those ni**ers go in the pool, someone is going to get seriously hurt.""</p> \n<p>As a 15-year-old with no language or way to make sense of it, I had to explain to those kids that they couldn't go in the public pool. It was a humiliating and devastating experience. It was very, very confusing, and so I would say that the seeds of what I'm doing here are sowed there.</p> \n<p>Also making <a href=""http://www.pbs.org/pov/twotownsofjasper/""><em>Two Towns of Jasper</em></a> [a film about the 1998 dragging death of a black man in Jasper, Texas]. The process of making that film fundamentally transformed my life.</p> \n<p>Then that experience that you've read about when I say my racial epiphany was sort of a big turning point in my life and how I thought about these things. It fundamentally changed the way I see the world, interact with the world, see other people, and interact with other people.</p> \n<p><span class=""features-toggle-interviewer"">Jenée Desmond-Harris:</span> Is the idea that white people will watch the films, and see the responses juxtaposed with the statistics you’ve offered about the reality of race in America, and say to themselves, ""Wow. These white people really don't get it, and now I'm going to get it""?</p> \n<p><span class=""features-toggle-interviewee"">Whitney Dow:</span> Maybe I'm naive, but I would say that every white person that watches it, I challenge them to tell me that some of the most discomforting things they hear and see in those videos, they all hold pieces of that somewhere inside themselves. Myself as well.</p> \n<div class=""float-right""><q>""I'm trying to give voice to my own community so they can listen to themselves""</q></div> \n<p>The idea that you might be afraid of a black person at some point. The idea that you might feel that black people, they feel that you owe them something and to be confused about that feeling and so not knowing how to process it. … Nothing that is in those videos is radical, and nothing in those videos I believe is out of the mainstream.</p> \n<p>You feel those feelings to a greater or lesser degree, I think, but I don't feel like I'm trying to say, ""White people, look at these racists."" Absolutely not. I'm saying, ""Look at some of the things, the issues that we have in our community around race and we need to grapple with them.""</p> \n<p><span class=""features-toggle-interviewer"">Jenée Desmond-Harris:</span> Why do you think so many of the responses ended up focusing on black people?</p> \n<p><span class=""features-toggle-interviewee"">Whitney Dow:</span> I believe our whiteness is so tangled up in our relationship to blackness. You ask white people about whiteness, and they talk about black people.</p> \n<p><span class=""features-toggle-interviewer"">Jenée Desmond-Harris:</span> Yeah, it's fascinating.</p> \n<p><span class=""features-toggle-interviewee"">Whitney Dow:</span> I got a letter from someone — a woman — a beautiful letter saying, ""These are incredibly painful videos to watch. Incredibly hard to watch but I always felt that my blackness was defined by whiteness, being a black woman in a white world. It was incredibly cathartic and relieving to see that white people are grappling with the same thing, that they feel like their whiteness is somehow defined in opposition of blackness. Seeing that we're grappling with the same things gave me some sort of inner peace.""</p> \n<p>That was something that completely caught me off guard because that's not what I was up to, but I think that, yeah — I think that our sense of ourselves is caught up in the other.</p> \n<p><span class=""features-toggle-interviewer"">Jenée Desmond-Harris:</span> There’s possibly a difference between the subjects’ response being problematic, or a little bit racist, or whatever, versus the project as a whole being racist or problematic. Is there a difference between the responses themselves and what we learn from the responses?</p> \n<p><span class=""features-toggle-interviewee"">Whitney Dow:</span> I've gotten emails that say things like, ""You're giving a platform for racist people."" Well, if somebody really believes that, they're fundamentally misunderstanding what I'm up to. Sometimes the truth is hard.</p> \n<p>There's some people I'm never going to convince that it's not problematic. There are some people who are very vocal. I went to see people of color early on in the process [to get feedback on the concept], and some people were like, ""This is phenomenal,"" and some people were like, ""You're a fucking asshole.""</p> \n<p>I didn't do this for people of color. I did this for white people. … People say, ""Why don't you do a blackness project?"" I said, ""Who am I to determine what black voices are heard on race? Why would I do that? That would be ridiculous.""</p> \n<p>I'm trying to give voice to my own community so they can listen to themselves.</p> \n<img data-chorus-asset-id=""2409132"" alt=""participants"" src=""http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2409132/15014892238_2601db8aa1_h.0.jpg""> \n<p class=""caption""><i>Whiteness Project</i> participants. (Whitney Dow)</p> \n<p><span class=""features-toggle-interviewer"">Jenée Desmond-Harris:</span> What’s the best possible outcome of this project, and what’s the worst?</p> \n<p><span class=""features-toggle-interviewee"">Whitney Dow:</span> I already feel like it's already been the best. I feel like people are giving it consideration in a serious way. It's not being dismissed out of hand. People are giving consideration both in media … and also they're giving it consideration in their private space. They're taking it to the networks, taking it to their forums. The traffic to the site is coming from the most bonkers places.</p> \n<p>It is becoming like a reference point for people, and that tells me that this issue of whiteness is critically embedded in everything. People kind of recognize it, and that's why it's all the traffic is coming from different places.</p> \n<p>What would be the worst thing? If I didn't get the funding to complete it. I feel like I've just started and I feel like I've opened the door, and I feel that in some ways I have an obligation to the people who have engaged so seriously to complete the project.</p> \n<p>I wouldn't want to let 21 people in Buffalo define this whole thing. I think there's a lot more people who should be weighing in.</p> \n<p><span class=""features-toggle-interviewer"">Jenée Desmond-Harris:</span> Are there times and places where it's productive for white people to think out loud about race and times when it is not?</p> \n<p><span class=""features-toggle-interviewee"">Whitney Dow:</span> That’s a really good question. … I recognize that it's a minefield. It's especially a minefield for white people. This is what I would say. I would say the people who are approaching white people and want to talk about race, if you believe that they're really sincere, cut them some slack that they're trying to engage it.</p> \n<p><span class=""features-toggle-interviewer"">Jenée Desmond-Harris:</span> What is one thing you tell people that you think can begin to change their thinking about what it means to be white?</p> \n<p><span class=""features-toggle-interviewee"">Whitney Dow:</span> One is the question I ask, ""What makes you white? What is it that makes you white? Is it your skin? Is it your ancestors?"" The other thing is, ""Ask yourself honestly … if there's anything in your life you can point to that is a benefit that you've received from being white. Think about that honestly.""</p> \n<q>""I feel like people are giving it consideration in a serious way. It's not being dismissed out of hand.""</q> \n<p>I think a lot of times in the videos you see white people want to talk about the things that they're losing. You've got to look at everything that's in the balance. You can't pick and choose and say, ""I didn't get into this college, therefore affirmative action is unfair and this whole system is unfair and I'm being discriminated against.""</p> \n<p>You need to look at everything else on that balance. Maybe your mortgage is lower and you don't have to think about your race on a day-to-day level. Maybe you have a better shot at getting a job, even though you're a felon, than a black man who is a felon. You've got to put everything on the scale. You can't just point to the stuff that isn't working out for you.</p> \n<p><span class=""features-toggle-interviewer"">Jenée Desmond-Harris:</span> I noticed you freely used the word ni**er earlier, which, to be honest, is not even something I like to say. And you’re white — so I think it's a really interesting choice on your part. Especially in the context of this project, because I’m guessing a lot of people you interviewed who are saying kind of horrendous things about black people wouldn't use that word.</p> \n<p><span class=""features-toggle-interviewee"">Whitney Dow:</span> They'd never use it.</p> \n<p><span class=""features-toggle-interviewer"">Jenée Desmond-Harris:</span> Right. I wonder if that’s something you've thought about explicitly, and how it lines up with your larger thinking about whiteness and race overall.</p> \n<p><span class=""features-toggle-interviewee"">Whitney Dow:</span> I guess it comes from my place as a documentary filmmaker. For me to say, ""F you don't get these n-words,"" I'm not representing reality. The reality of the situation was how that word hit me in that situation. I wouldn't be telling the story accurately if I didn't say it. I also sometimes I think it's good for white liberal progressives to hear it, because it's the reality of what people think.</p> \n<p>It softens it so much in this ""n-word"" this and ""n-word"" that. I would never use it in the context of not telling a story or the context of ""You's my ni**a."" It's not my word.</p> \n<p><i>This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity and length.</i></p> \n</interview></div> \n<p> \n<link href=""http://apps.voxmedia.com/tools/stylesheets/tools/features-public-toggle.css"" media=""screen"" rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css""> \n<script src=""http://apps.voxmedia.com/tools/javascripts/tools/features-public-toggle.js"" type=""text/javascript""></script> \n<link href=""http://apps.voxmedia.com/tools/stylesheets/sites/vox.css"" media=""screen"" rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css""> \n<script src=""http://apps.voxmedia.com/tools/javascripts/sites/vox.js"" type=""text/javascript""></script> \n</p>",Movies

It was ambiguous about which establishments would fall under the new guidance. Fast-food restaurants like McDonald's would obviously make the cut, but establishments that didn't sell food as their primary business — amusement parks, for example — were in a gray area. Grocery stores <a href=""http://Grocery%20stories%20gripped%20to%20the%20administration%20about%20the%20"">griped</a> to the Obama administration about the regulatory burden. Movie theaters had<a href=""http://articles.latimes.com/2011/mar/10/business/la-fi-popcorn-20110310""> lobbied vigorously</a> to have their 1,000-calorie popcorns excluded from the labeling requirement.</p> \n<p>And initially, they won: The Food and Drug Administration's 2011 draft regulation proposed excluding establishments that had a primary business <i>other </i>than selling food. This would cover, according to the FDA, ""movie theaters, amusement parks, general merchandise stores with in-house concession stands, hotels, and transportation carriers such as trains and airplanes.""</p> \n<h3>The White House's final menu label rules are more aggressive than initial drafts — but now they're on hold</h3> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2490654/177886212.0.jpg"" alt=""goofy"" data-chorus-asset-id=""2490654""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Even Goofy will fall under the heavy hand of Obamacare regulations: The Obama administration will require amusement parks to post calorie labels (Peter Bischoff/PB Archive)</p> \n<p>The FDA got pushback on that decision from some Democratic legislators this summer, who sent the agency a letter arguing that movie theaters ought to post labels, too.</p> \n<p>""The aim was not to confine the scope of the law solely to restaurants … but to apply broadly to restaurants as well as other retail food establishments,"" Sen. Tom Harkin (D-IA) and Rep. Rosa DeLauro (D-CT) wrote in an August letter. ""The proposed definition is narrower than that intended by Congress.""</p> \n<p>A summary of the final regulations, released Monday, suggests the FDA heeded that advice: The agency will take a more sweeping view of who falls under the label law.

""The FDA agrees additional time is necessary for the agency to provide further clarifying guidance to help facilitate efficient compliance across all covered businesses and for covered establishments to come into compliance with the final rule.""</p> \n<h3>Will calorie labels make people healthier?</h3> \n<p>Public health research gives reason to be skeptical that calorie labels will significantly change people's eating habits. Not all consumers notice the calorie information. And among those who do, the body of research slightly leans against these labels changing behaviors.</p> \n<p>One <a href=""http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/28/6/w1110.full"">2008 study</a>, conducted by Brian Elbel, Rogan Kersh, Victoria Brescoll, and L.

Some said they would buy fewer calories, too. But at the end of the day, they didn't follow through. New York City residents studied here, who came from low-income demographics, purchased the same amount of calories before and after the labels came online. You'll notice a slight uptick in the chart below, although the authors note it's statistically insignificant.</p> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""2490324"" alt=""calories health affairs"" src=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2490324/labels.0.gif""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">(Health Affairs)</p> \n<p>Other research has been more mixed. <a style=""font-size: 1.15em; line-height: 1.65; background-color: #ffffff;"" href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23683977"">One study</a> in Seattle, conducted between 2008 and 2010, didn't find any change in the number of calories ordered at burger and sandwich restaurants — but did see a decline at taco and coffee stores.</p> \n<p><a href=""http://ageconsearch.umn.edu/bitstream/150622/2/submission-AAEA-1.pdf"">Another study</a>, conducted by two University of Minnesota researchers, found that when consumers were presented with calorie information in a survey setting, they would reduce their intended food order's calories by about 3 percent.

""I'm just not going to get it financed. So the question doesn't even come up.""</p> \n<p>Scott is trying to make the point that Christian Bale and Sigourney Weaver are big names, and entice backers to believe in his project. But he also exemplifies a lack of grace and empathy that is sadly too common when talking about race, ethnicity, and the business of Hollywood.</p> \n<p>It's all too easy to find something chilling in Scott's derogatory dismissal of non-white (possibly Arab) actors as Mohammad so-and-so, in that it points to pernicious stereotypes about certain actors of color. When coupled with what Scott says about financing, it seems like if you are an actor of color, chances are slim that Scott would want to work with you.</p> \n<p>Perhaps more troublesome is that Scott is voicing what he believes is the way the ""business"" works — that financiers will only back your movie if it stars a white actor who is well-known. For non-white actors, Scott's view and people who share it make the industry difficult to break into.</p> \n<p>According to the <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.bunchecenter.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/2014-Hollywood-Diversity-Report-2-12-14.pdf"">Bunche Center</a> for African American Studies at UCLA, white actors possessed nearly 90 percent of the lead roles in the 172 theatrical films released in 2011. That means they're more likely to become big stars, making it even harder for non-white actors to take those lead roles and become big stars themselves.</p> \n<p>Scott is trying — in clumsy fashion — to explain why the system is such a mess. But in so doing, he's just pointing out why it's rarely a good idea to become comfortable with such a system.</p>",Movies

How Marvel's writers' retreat became the secret meeting everyone wants to be invited to,http://www.vox.com/2014/12/17/7394103/marvel-writers-retreat,"It's a convergence of the company's biggest stars, a hotbed of ideas, and the birthplace of stories that have shaped (and will shape) the Marvel Universe.","<p><span>Last week, Marvel held one of the most important events in the comic book industry: its writers' retreat. The retreat is a convergence of the company's biggest stars, a hotbed of ideas, and the birthplace of stories that have shaped — and will shape — the Marvel Universe. The retreat could also be where the characters and story arcs for some future blockbuster movies are hatched.</span></p> \n<p><span>And with great power comes great speculation. Comic book fans and journalists are always eager to see who is and who isn't at the retreat, then read the tea leaves, trying to determine what this means for their favorite characters. </span></p> \n<p><span>Here's what you need to know about the meeting of Marvel's minds. </span></p> \n<h3>What is the Marvel retreat?</h3> \n<p>Marvel's writers retreat is a gathering of writers and editors at Marvel to discuss future stories, characters, and plots. Marvel, to its credit, has been really good at keeping the retreats' happening on its own terms. The company has also been good at parlaying and managing that secrecy into fan hype, and turning the retreat into something fans are genuinely interested in.</p> \n<h3>Why do Marvel's writers need a retreat? Are they tired?</h3> \n<p>A huge reason for the retreat has to do with Marvel's success with big crossover events. Crossovers, which really took off in the <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.newsarama.com/22371-nycc-2014-marvel-75th-x-men-w-len-wein-chris-claremont-many-more-live.html"">Chris Claremont era</a><b> </b>(the Mutant Massacre of 1986 comes to mind) of Marvel comic books, involve multiple characters, multiple teams, and multiple tie-in books. For example, the current Marvel event <i>AXIS</i> has an ongoing book, and myriad of tie-ins that the company produces and promotes to advance a single story. Here's what a back page of an <i>Axis: Avengers &amp; X-Men</i> comic book looks like:</p> \n<center> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2553512/Screen_Shot_2014-12-15_at_8.22.58_PM.0.png"" alt=""Screen_Shot_2014-12-15_at_8.22.58_PM.0.png"" data-chorus-asset-id=""2553512""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Axis: Avengers and X-Men. (Marvel)</p> \n</center> \n<p>In order to preserve continuity in all these books, so much planning takes place. That's why writers and editors all attend this retreat — they're hammering out what happens and what the ramifications are in the entire Marvel universe.</p> \n<p>Axel Alonso, Marvel's editor-in-chief, has described the retreat like basketball practice. He says he even manages it as such.</p> \n<p>""I do my best to manage the clock so we avoid going down rabbit holes for too long. I call time outs when things get too heated, or people need a break, or everyone's just plain talked out,"" he told <a href=""http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=52109"" target=""_blank"">Comic Book Resources </a>in April. ""And, keeping that coaching analogy alive, I do my best to foster an environment where everyone is engaged and involved and understanding where they can fit in.""</p> \n<h3>Are there human knots? Ice-breakers? Trust falls?</h3> \n<p>The goings-on are usually kept secret. So… maybe?</p> \n<h3>Why do people who read comics care about what goes on there?</h3> \n<p>The comics. As in any profession with lots of devoted fans, the audience wants to know what the latest bit of information is. These retreats are where that's happening.</p> \n<p>Writer and editors play into this, too. Because writers have become as well-known as the comics they write, a writer's presence at the retreat is usually a sign that the characters they're in charge of will have a major role in upcoming events. And because we live in the age of social media, when star writers can do things like post pictures from the retreat, it piques interest:</p> \n<blockquote class=""twitter-tweet"" lang=""en""> \n<p>The marvel retreat!! <a href=""http://t.co/homiHnCB87"">pic.twitter.com/homiHnCB87</a></p> \n— BRIAN MICHAEL BENDIS (@BRIANMBENDIS) <a href=""https://twitter.com/BRIANMBENDIS/status/397768792979542016"">November 5, 2013</a>\n</blockquote> \n<p> \n<script charset=""utf-8"" src=""//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js""></script> \n</p> \n<p>But fans are also interested in who <i>isn't</i> invited.</p> \n<p>One of the growing <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/11/10/7185205/captain-america-remender"">conversations</a> surrounding <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/11/10/7185205/captain-america-remender"">Marvel</a> involves diversity and representation. <span>And though the company has made strides in the past few years, seeing the representation of women and people of color at these retreats has become increasingly important to fans. </span></p> \n<p>Earlier this year, the retreat made some news when Kelly Sue DeConnick, one of Marvel's star writers and the force behind Captain Marvel, revealed she had not been invited.</p> \n<p>""I am not invited to the creative retreats, and I have never had the writers' room experience,"" DeConnick told the<a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.bleedingcool.com/2014/09/kelly-sue-deconnick/""> Inkstuds Podcast</a> in September.</p> \n<p>This prompted <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.theouthousers.com/index.php/news/128946-kelly-sue-deconnick-not-invited-to-marvel-writer-retreats-because-shes-not-an-exclusive-writer-who-can-do-a-backflip-while-juggling-flaming-knives-in-a-bear-costume-while-singing-baritone-in-a-barber-shop-quartet-during-the-winter-solstice-on-a-leap-year.html"">accusations</a> of <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.theouthousers.com/index.php/news/128946-kelly-sue-deconnick-not-invited-to-marvel-writer-retreats-because-shes-not-an-exclusive-writer-who-can-do-a-backflip-while-juggling-flaming-knives-in-a-bear-costume-while-singing-baritone-in-a-barber-shop-quartet-during-the-winter-solstice-on-a-leap-year.html"">sexism</a> from a few comic book journalists.

Seeing The Interview doesn't hurt North Korea and Kim Jong Un â€”Â it helps them,http://www.vox.com/2014/12/24/7443035/interview-north-korea,Portraying the movie as an act of defiance against Kim Jong Un buys into his propaganda and helps him stay in power.,"<p>The ultimate way to celebrate American freedom and defy the evil North Koreans this holiday season, many people seem to believe, is to watch <i>The Interview</i>.</p> \n<p><i>The Interview</i>, which has been <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_interview_2014/"">trashed</a> in reviews<b> </b>and would surely have been a dud had the Sony hack never happened, has become seen as a way for Americans to demonstrate their patriotism. By watching it, the thinking goes, you are supporting America's commitment to free speech and thumbing your nose at North Korea, which apparently hacked Sony over the film.</p> \n<p>""Celebrate America's freedom by watching,"" Republican National Committee chair Reince Priebus <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://twitter.com/Reince/status/547772438445301760"">tweeted</a>.

The supposed celebration of free speech is a tremendous favor to the regime that is by far the worst human rights abuser on earth.</p> \n<p>Of course it's fine to see <i>The Interview</i> if you'd simply like to watch a goofy slapstick comedy. But don't let Sony fool you into seeing the movie's release as a celebration of freedom rather than a simple business play. And don't let North Korea trick you into thinking that you're punishing Kim Jong Un by treating this movie as a blow against his country when, in fact, you'd be helping him out.</p> \n<h3>North Korea wants you to see <i>The Interview</i> as an insult against Kim Jong Un</h3> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/assets/4414907/462150311.jpg"" alt=""north korea kim jong un KNS/AFP/Getty Images"" data-chorus-asset-id=""639020""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">(KNS/AFP/Getty Images)</p> \n<p>The fact that North Korea's English-language propaganda has been hammering for weeks at the idea that <i>The Interview</i> is an insult to Kim and attack on North Korea should tell you something: North Korea really wants for you to believe that <i>The Interview</i> is an insult to Kim and an attack on North Korea.</p> \n<p><span>The real reason that North Korea hacked Sony (or, if it did not hack Sony, the reason it has strongly implied it was responsible) is not because Kim Jong Un felt insulted by </span><i>The Interview</i><span>, which depicts his assassination. </span><a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/12/19/7421535/the-real-reason-north-korea-would-hack-sony-its-not-the-interview"" style=""font-size: 1.15em; line-height: 1.65; background-color: #ffffff;"">The real reason</a><span> is that North Korea wants — needs — to find regular excuses to gin up conflict between it and the United States. And the massive cyberattack is just the latest in a long line of such look-at-me attacks on South Korea and the US, stretching back decades.</span></p> \n<p><span>This is belligerence meant to deter the much stronger South Korea and US, and to draw international attention that North Korea can use to bolster domestic propaganda portraying Kim Jong Un as a fearless leader showing up the evil foreign imperialists. It is meant to foment the isolation and tension that has allowed the Kim family to hold onto power for decades. It has nothing to do with Sony's film, however offensive it may be, or with the film's portrayal of Kim, or with free speech in America. By believing North Korea's rhetoric strongly implying a connection, we are buying into the country's strategy and helping Kim succeed.</span></p> \n<p><span>Kim Jong Un isn't stupid: he knows that his impoverished state is far weaker than the US or South Korea or Japan, any of which would just love to see his government collapse. North Korea can only deter those enemies by being more threatening and dangerous.

Americans are so convinced of North Korea's power, and of its belligerence, that they see the act of simply watching a movie in their hometown theater or streaming online<b> </b>as a show of brave defiance. And they see America as not just in conflict with North Korea, but that conflict as so important that families will spend their Christmas watching a movie perceived to be a front in America's battle for freedom. Even Vladimir Putin could never have dreamed of a propaganda victory so resounding.</p> \n<p>At the same time, maintaining this appearance of constant conflict with the United States is crucial a part of Kim's strategy for holding onto power.</p> \n<p>North Korea's breathtakingly oppressive government keeps power by telling its citizens that they are at a state of permanent war with the evil American imperialists. This generates rally-around-the-flag loyalty and fear of the outside. It's also an excuse for the country's poverty and dictatorship, explained as necessary to keep the military strong enough guard against the American threat. But this requires keeping the appearance of a conflict with the US going at all times, which means occasionally North Korea has to lash out to maintain tensions. The idea was to do that with this Sony hack, but with Americans now buzzing over the film that supposedly offended Kim, it's succeeded beyond what they could have imagined. </p> \n<p>It is unfortunate that so many Americans have bought into Kim's propaganda by agreeing to dignify the country as a dangerous and viable adversary, one that deserves to be shown up in mass nationwide viewings of <em>The Interview</em>. In truth, North Korea's government is a frail and despicable regime that deserves no such honor.</p> \n<p>In treating <i>The Interview</i> as a front in the battle for American ideals, we are flattering Kim. We are supporting North Korea's absurd pretensions that it is a real threat to those ideals, and worse we are actively participating in the made-up America-versus-North Korea contest that is so essential for Kim's rule.</p>",Movies
"How ""Selma"" gets Martin Luther King, Jr., right",http://www.vox.com/2014/12/24/7443697/selma-movie-review,The biopic is beautifully intimate.,"<p>The first time the audience sees Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., in <em>Selma</em>, he appears head-on, in a traditional close-up. It's the way we're used to seeing historic figures in films like this — elevated to titans who dominate the frame and our attention.</p> \n<p>But then, over the course of the film's two hours, director Ava DuVernay forces us to look at King in new ways. Some of that is in the film's screenplay, which shows us King in unguarded, private moments with his wife and friends. But much of it is simply in how DuVernay <em>presents</em> the man. She shoots him in profile, or isolates him in corners of the frame that seem to emphasize his powerlessness.</p> \n<p>In so doing, she underscores something important to remember, in an era when King's successes seem preordained. Nothing here was certain. Everything could have fallen apart so easily. Life, even when it seems to follow the arc of a movie, is never a movie.<strong> </strong>It cannot be so easily predicted.</p> \n<p>By the time we see King in full close-up again, near the film's end, he's come through the fire. He is stronger and wiser for what he has suffered, but success does not erase the suffering.</p> \n \n<h4>RELATED: <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/12/24/7436393/selma-movie-ava-duvernay"" target=""new"">Interviews with the director and the star of <em>Selma</em></a>\n</h4> \n \n<h3>A long-awaited project</h3> \n<p>There have been rumors of movies about King for decades. His life and accomplishments fit so neatly into the Hollywood biopic format — and would seem such a natural fit for winning lots of Oscars — that it's a little surprising it's taken this long. This is the first movie to follow the man's life story.</p> \n<p>But what's impressive about <em>Selma</em> is how little it borrows from the traditional biopic playbook. DuVernay and screenwriter Paul Webb (who wrote the film's original drafts but was eventually replaced by DuVernay, who wrote the script the film was made from) focus exclusively on the campaign King led in Selma, Alabama, which led to the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Like earlier biopics <em>Capote</em> and <em>Lincoln</em>, it focuses on a very narrow slice of its subject's life, to give us a better sense of that person as a human being instead of an icon. And like those films, it's as much about process as people, about how political change is sometimes best effected by understanding tactics and keeping one's nose to the grindstone.</p> \n<p>King is played with a mesmerizing intensity by British actor David Oyelowo, who worked with DuVernay before on her terrific, low-budget indie <em>Middle of Nowhere</em>. Oyelowo beautifully captures two sides of King's personality: the one we've all seen that draws from the fiery rhetoric of Southern preachers, and the side that was warm and tender and even uncertain in private among friends. The aim is not to reduce King's accomplishments but, rather, to understand how history and destiny pushed him toward a kind of divine mission.</p> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""2878278"" alt=""sel-12361r.0.jpg"" src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2878278/sel-12361r.0.jpg""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">(Paramount Pictures, Pathé, and Harpo Films)</p> \n<p>In so doing, it allows viewers to see the fight against injustice as an eternal struggle. The mistake too many biopics make is in suggesting that the evils their protagonists battled against went away after these historic heroes were successful. But injustice has a way of burying itself ever deeper in people's hearts, then coming out in unpredictable, even violent ways. King could crusade to eliminate prejudicial laws; he couldn't eliminate prejudice itself.</p> \n<p>In that way and in its interest in how activists can affect the halls of Washington (President Lyndon B. Johnson, played by Tom Wilkinson, is a major character), <em>Selma</em> plays almost as a stealth sequel to <em>Lincoln. </em>Abraham Lincoln might have ended slavery by forcing the 13th Amendment through Congress, but the its effects would still be very much in evidence for King to push back against. And then the song that plays over <em>Selma</em>'s closing credits mentions the events in Ferguson, and the film's power is all the more evident. That which King struggled against is still present, just ever more deeply buried.</p> \n<h3>A more intimate focus</h3> \n<p>The thought of a movie about Martin Luther King, Jr., immediately brings to mind sweeping vistas and sing-alongs of ""We Shall Overcome."" But from everything I've described so far, it should be clear that DuVernay has far more interest in undercutting those preconceptions than anything else.</p> \n<p>She almost had to undercut them. At just $20 million, <em>Selma</em> isn't blessed with the kind of budget that can allow for massive scope, and it fills its cast not with recognizable names (save producer Oprah Winfrey in a small supporting role) but, instead, with some of the world's best character actors.</p> \n<p>Wilkinson's Johnson is a man struggling to overcome his own prejudices and largely succeeding, while Tim Roth turns George Wallace into a figure who would inspire comic relief if the things he believed weren't so loathsome. And as Hosea Williams and John Lewis, respectively, Wendell Pierce and Stephan James give King moments of pause and reflection he desperately needs.</p> \n<p>DuVernay's intimate focus is best observed in the scenes set in King's marriage to his wife, Coretta (Carmen Ejogo). The director's strongest work is often in these scenes, which subtly reveal how much this film is about relationships and the ways that they push and pull even the greatest people to ever have lived to be better than their best selves. The Kings' marriage is not an easy one, with Martin leaving home for long periods of time and proving unfaithful. But Ejogo finds in Coretta someone who loves her husband for the man he truly is, not just the man the rest of the world sees.</p> \n<h3>Restoring King's humanity</h3> \n<p>That intimacy is reflected throughout the film. Bradford Young's cinematography pulls out the tiniest of shifts in facial expressions as the characters think and ponder, always lighting Oyelowo perfectly so even when DuVernay is isolating him over in the frame's corner, we get a sense of King's power and influence. Composer Jason Moran's score opts for sweeping orchestral heft as rarely as possible, choosing, instead, to focus on simple pieces featuring only a handful of instruments. And Ruth E. Carter's costumes beautifully<strong> </strong>accentuate the characters' relationships to each other and the movement.</p> \n<p>By far the best technical work in the film is courtesy of editor Spencer Averick and sound mixer Willie D. Burton, who both allow DuVernay's vision of King's life unfolding almost as a collage of visuals and sounds to take root. There are numerous sequences in this film that unfold less as traditional units of storytelling than as collections of experiences, grafted together in ways that restore something most Americans know primarily from history books to something primal and real.</p> \n<p>And isn't that the ultimate mission of the biopic at its best? We tend to think of the genre as a lazy way to win awards and critical respectability, but the very best film biographies are ones that force us to look at famous people all over again, to try to understand what drove them to such greatness. <em>Selma </em>more than does that with King, pulling him away from a figurehead and back toward someone who actually lived and actually fought for the things he believed in.</p> \n<p>But, then, in its rousing, riveting, moving conclusion <em>Selma</em> goes even one better than that. King isn't just a great man — though he is that. He's part of a continuum of great human beings who have battled and struggled and pushed for what was right, for a better, more just world. His work isn't done. His work can never be done, because the world is never its best self. <em>Selma</em> isn't a discrete story of one moment in time that we can observe safely from the sidelines. It is all around us, every day. <em>Selma</em> is each and every one of our lives, over and over again. To not fight against the injustices we see is to fail the messages this film conveys.</p>",Movies

He adds, ""I have a butthole.""</p> \n<p>While Kim is thought to speak English, it's difficult to imagine him ever discussing his ""pee and poo.""</p> \n<p>More to the point, it's difficult to imagine how or why anyone at Sony Pictures could think that this scene would be remotely funny, or even amusing.

Once some North Koreans see the film, the thinking goes, they will find the cartoonish and mocking portrayal of Kim Jong Un so liberating that they will question the entire system built around his rule.</p> \n<p><span>Even if that does happen, its impact on the North Korean system is likely to be marginal. T</span><span>he Kim regime survived a 1990s famine that wiped out as many as one in 10 citizens. It has survived the influx of information about the outside world, beginning in the 2000s, that finally showed that the propaganda about North Korea's great wealth was a lie and that South Koreans live in unimaginable prosperity.

Donating to a human rights group, however, would be direct, tangible, and very easy to measure. Seth Rogen and James Franco could count and possibly even meet the North Koreans whose lives they would have bettered or even saved. And it would come at a much lower cost than the $44 million film.</p> \n<h3>North Koreans badly need our help — and so do the groups trying to help them</h3> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""2883908"" alt=""52987123.0.jpg"" src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2883908/52987123.0.jpg""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">North Korean boys eat a meal provided by the World Food Program, which has since run out of money (Gerald Bourke/WFP via Getty)</p> \n<p>It is difficult to articulate the full extent of the horrors facing North Koreans, from the ever-present threat of political violence to the smothering ubiquity of propaganda to the <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/10/27/7073029/north-korea-gulags-prison-camps-explainer"">gulag system</a> in which one percent of the population is routinely tortured, starved, and murdered.</p> \n<p>Donating to an aid group is not going to end those abuses. But there is another category of problems that aid groups can address.</p> \n<p>One problem is getting information in and out of North Korea. The abstract ideas conveyed in an <i>Interview</i>-style satire are fine, but there is a much more fundamental need for transferring nuts-and-bolts basic information in and out of the country — and in Korea. Some North Korean rights groups focus on broadcasting information in to the country about the truth of what's happening within the country and in the world. People inside the country can, in turn, transmit out critical intelligence about happenings there. Smuggling networks and defector groups can better coordinate. That all costs money, but it's money that is put into direct, demonstrably positive use for helping North Koreans.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""right"">Rescuing one defector costs about $3,000</q></p> \n<p>Another major problem is getting defectors out of the country. It's not just crossing the border. Defectors need guides who can ferry them secretly across China, dodging the Chinese authorities who will send them home to be punished, then into southeast Asia, then to South Korea. The trip is long, dangerous, and expensive.</p> \n<p>Some defectors sell themselves into slavery to afford the trip; others are sold by duplicitous ""guides."" Many die along the way, or spend their lives trapped in forced labor or sexual slavery. Aid groups exist that quietly fund defector guides and ""underground railroads;"" with the kind of money that Franco and Rogen are making on <i>The Interview</i>, they could help many more defectors, saving them from the horrors of North Korea and from the perils of an unguided journey.</p> \n<p>Once defectors make it to South Korea, though, they find themselves totally unequipped to survive in the South's fast-paced and extremely competitive economy — not to mention in a society where North Koreans are often looked down upon. It's not just that they don't know how to use a computer or go shopping. The brutally ubiquitous state control of life in North Korea leaves them with few social skills. Many defectors fall into poverty and depression. Some aid groups do great work helping defectors adjust and come to support themselves. But these groups could do a lot more with more funding.</p> \n<p>The groups working within North Korea itself are, naturally, severely limited by the North Korean government. But some United Nations programs are still able to bring in food and medicine, which are both often in dire short supply in the country, especially for children. Those programs are perpetually underfunded.</p> \n<p>Raising American awareness about North Korea's evil dictator through a comedic film is all well and good, but <i>The Interview</i>'s filmmakers and supporters have an opportunity to channel that awareness into real, direct action that could bring concrete change for North Koreans. There is no better way to do that than by redirecting the film's proceeds into one or several of the great charities and aid groups who are helping North Koreans right now, but who need our help to do so.</p> \n<p>Rogen and Franco, by making this show of support for North Koreans, could show that they really mean what they say about this film being about making a difference, could help channel all the energy around the film into a larger movement for donating to North Korean aid groups, and could change the conversation about their film.</p> \n<h3>Some charities Rogen and Franco might want to consider giving to</h3> \n<p><iframe scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""0"" height=""360"" width=""640"" src=""https://embed-ssl.ted.com/talks/joseph_kim_the_family_i_lost_in_north_korea_and_the_family_i_gained.html""></iframe></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Joseph Kim, a North Korean refugee who was helped by Liberty in North Korea, discusses his experience in a Ted Talk.</p> \n<p><b>1) </b><a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.wfp.org/get-involved/donate"">United Nations World Food Program</a><b>: </b>North Korea's famine ended in the 1990s, but hunger and malnutrition are still rampant, as are occasional ""micro-famines"" due to localized food shortages.

Diesel's image strongly hints he's somehow involved in the new project.</p> \n<p>Here's why people think this image suggests that:</p> \n<h3>1) He's done this before</h3> \n<p>This isn't the first time that Diesel has hinted at involvement with the Inhumans. Back in August, Diesel made a post on Facebook that also hinted at his involvement with the Inhumans:</p> \n<div id=""fb-root""></div> \n<p> \n<script type=""text/javascript""><!-- \n(function(d, s, id) { var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0]; if (d.getElementById(id)) return; js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.src = ""//connect.facebook.net/en_US/all.js#xfbml=1""; fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs); }(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk')); \n// --></script> \n</p> \n<div class=""fb-post"" data-href=""https://www.facebook.com/VinDiesel/photos/a.101465923312.101581.89562268312/10152718210358313/?type=1"" data-width=""466""> \n<div class=""fb-xfbml-parse-ignore"">\n<a href=""https://www.facebook.com/VinDiesel/photos/a.101465923312.101581.89562268312/10152718210358313/?type=1"">Post</a> by <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/VinDiesel"">Vin Diesel</a>.</div> \n</div> \n<p>That was before Marvel had announced it was making a movie and around the time people were wondering what Marvel was going to do next. <i>Guardians of the Galaxy</i> had opened to big box office numbers and was universally well-received, and it increasingly seemed Marvel could do no wrong.</p> \n<p>In hindsight, now that we know that Marvel is planning an Inhumans movie, Diesel's tease makes it seem as if he's been in on Marvel's future plans for a while.</p> \n<h3>2) Vin Diesel would be the perfect Black Bolt</h3> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""2887050"" alt=""Screen_Shot_2014-12-29_at_11.01.46_AM.0.png"" src=""https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2887050/Screen_Shot_2014-12-29_at_11.01.46_AM.0.png""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">(Marvel)</p> \n<p>Black Bolt is the leader and face of the Inhumans. He's superhumanly buff to the point where his muscles have muscles. With that in mind, casting Black Bolt would require someone who has action movie pedigree <i>and</i> someone who could physically (or at least look like they could) go toe to toe with WWE wrestlers.</p> \n<p>The number of actors who could play a convincing Black Bolt would already be slim, but with actors like Tom Hardy, The Rock, and Jason Momoa,<b> </b>signed on to DC projects and Bautista reprising his role as Drax the Destroyer in <i>Guardians 2</i>, those numbers are even slimmer.</p> \n<p>And Diesel, it just so happens, would be perfect for the role. He's physically imposing enough to command Black Bolt's gravitas. And Black Bolt's brooding nature wouldn't expose his weaknesses as an actor — other members of the Inhumans like Black Bolt's wife <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/8/13/5997383/inhumans-explainer-marvel-movie"" target=""_blank"">Medusa</a>, or the charismatic villain <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/8/13/5997383/inhumans-explainer-marvel-movie"" target=""_blank"">Maximus</a> do the heavy lifting when it comes to emotions, depth, and humor.</p> \n<h3>3) And it could all work out</h3> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""2887022"" alt=""Screen_Shot_2014-12-29_at_10.57.45_AM.0.png"" src=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2887022/Screen_Shot_2014-12-29_at_10.57.45_AM.0.png""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">(Marvel)</p> \n<p>There's one loophole that could conceivably allow Diesel to play Groot and Black Bolt in the same movie: Black Bolt doesn't talk. One of Black Bolt's powers is that he can release huge amounts of energy when he speaks — he can level planets with a scream but can also do some damage with a whisper. It's a blessing and a curse, as Black Bolt has the power to defeat bad guys but has to be constantly vigilant about speaking.</p> \n<p>What this means is that Diesel could play Black Bolt and Groot, and only have to use his voice for one of the roles. There wouldn't be any confusion that two of the characters sound the same, and Marvel would have a nifty little gimmick in having Diesel's image for one character and his voice for another.</p> \n<p>To be clear, all this talk lives in the possibility of what Marvel ""could"" do and that's far removed from what it would ""want"" to do. It would probably prefer to have another A-lister take on Black Bolt, to compete with the buzz vibrating from Warner Bros.'s <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/12/3/7325777/suicide-squad-dc-explained"" target=""_blank""><i>Suicide Squad</i></a>, and it would probably want to be more flexible with the Inhumans, as it's a franchise that could — if it includes <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/10/14/6972775/marvel-young-adult-novel"" target=""_blank"">Ms. Marvel,</a> one of Marvel's biggest hits in years — appeal to younger audiences than the Avengers<i> </i>— who could seem a bit long in the tooth by 2018 — do. Those are only two of Marvel's plethora of options.</p> \n<p>But even if Marvel doesn't choose to cast Diesel or include him in an Inhumans plot, it certainly doesn't hurt that he's a good company man.</p>",Movies

It's as if Marvel made that <a href=""http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x26rzz6_marvels-coming-attractions-snl-40th_fun"" target=""_blank""><i>SNL</i> skit</a> come to life, and simply made an <i>Ant-Man</i> remix of the <i>Guardians</i> trailer.</p> \n<p>Here's why you may be getting crazy <i>Guardians</i> flashbacks right now:</p> \n<h3>Ant-Man and Star Lord (Chris Pratt) have very similar masks and uniforms</h3> \n<p>The two characters share the same grey-red-metal color scheme. And both have funky masks with red eyes. Here's Ant-Man's uniform:</p> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2911166/2015-01-07_00_15_37.0.gif"" alt=""2015-01-07_00_15_37.0.gif"" data-chorus-asset-id=""2911166""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">(Ant-Man)</p> \n<p>And here is Star Lord's:</p> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2911170/2015-01-07_00_21_18.0.gif"" alt=""2015-01-07_00_21_18.0.gif"" data-chorus-asset-id=""2911170""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Guardians of the Galaxy</p> \n<p>They could be superhero brothers. But this isn't the only similarity. It's actually just the first.</p> \n<h3>The ab shots</h3> \n<p>Perhaps the most important step in Chris Pratt's metamorphosis from funny man to movie hunk was the increased definition of his abs. In the <i>Guardians</i> trailer, there is a gratuitous shot of Pratt's abs being doused with water:</p> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""2911178"" alt=""2015-01-07_00_26_36.0.gif"" src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2911178/2015-01-07_00_26_36.0.gif""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">(Guardians of the Galaxy)</p> \n<p>In the <i>Ant-Man</i> trailer, there's a similar shot of Paul Rudd's defined stomach which means, of course, he is now a legit movie star.

It's a movie about a black-and-white distinction between good and evil, but it is set almost entirely in the <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/1/21/7641189/american-sniper-history"">Iraq War</a>, which can only be honestly portrayed in shades of gray.</p> \n<p>Faced with a choice between altering its <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/1/21/7865145/american-sniper-review"">narrative</a> to account for that gray versus altering the facts of history, the film chose the latter.

There are, he explains, three types of people in the world: wolves, sheep, and sheepdogs. The evil wolves threaten the sheep. The sheep are good people, but vulnerable to harm because they're too naive to understand that evil exists. That means that it's up to the sheepdogs to protect them from harm.</span></p> \n<p><span></span><span>In that metaphor, Kyle is America's border collie, shepherding the weak and vulnerable away from harm. The movie's Big Bad Wolves are al-Qaeda terrorists, led by a psychopathic child-torturer and his marksman sidekick. </span></p> \n<p>And the sheep? They would be the other Americans who lack Chris Kyle's vision and fortitude, and fail to understand that you're either with us or against us. That includes fellow US troops who lack Kyle's skill, or who dare to question the war. Iraqis, by contrast, are not sheep: in this movie they're either wolves themselves, or nameless collateral damage. Mostly wolves, though.</p> \n<h3>The movie's ""wolf"" problem</h3> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3327838/shutterstock_245606815.0.jpg"" alt=""Wolf"" data-chorus-asset-id=""3327838""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">(Shutterstock.com)</p> \n<p><i>American Sniper</i> stacks its narrative deck, using imaginary history and characters to give Kyle a suitably evil foe to fight. While it's never great to see a movie falsify a true story, <i>American Sniper</i>'s disdainful<span> attitude towards the truth is especially disingenuous in light of its broader ""you're either with us, or you're a naive sheep"" narrative. </span></p> \n<p>To maximize the bigness and badness of its available wolves, <i>American Sniper</i> rewrites history, turning the Iraq War into a response to the attacks of September 11, 2001.</p> \n<p>The film finds time for entire scenes of Kyle viewing TV news reports about al-Qaeda's 1998 bombings of US embassies, and the planes hitting the Twin Towers on 9/11. And when Kyle gets to Iraq, his commander explains that they are hunting the leaders of al-Qaeda in Iraq. The inference we're supposed to gather is clear: that Kyle is fighting the same people who attacked America in 1998 and 2001.</p> \n<p>By contrast, the actual reasons for the Iraq war go unmentioned. Th<span>e words ""Saddam Hussein"" are never uttered in the movie. Nor are ""George Bush,"" ""Sunni,"" ""Shia,"" or ""weapons of mass destruction."" </span></p> \n<p><span>As </span><a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/1/21/7641189/american-sniper-history"">Zack Beauchamp</a><span> points out, this depiction of the war is breathtakingly dishonest. </span><span>The Iraq War was not a response to 9/11: this was a war America chose, officially based on reports of weapons of mass destruction that were implausible at the time, and that have since been proven false.</span></p> \n<p>In real life, <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.dmagazine.com/publications/d-magazine/2013/april/the-legend-of-chris-kyle-01?single=1"">Chris Kyle</a> argued that America owed its troops support because those troops did not get to choose the wars they fought, or the strategy they followed: they wrote the government a blank check for their lives and waited to see if it would get cashed. There's a very interesting movie to be made about that idea, and about what it means to be heroic during a misguided war. <i>American Sniper</i> isn't it.</p> \n<p>Instead, the film heightens the good-vs-evil stakes by supplying Kyle with two fictionalized enemies: ""The Butcher,"" an al-Qaeda in Iraq enforcer famed for his brutality, and ""Mustafa,"" a Syrian who once won Olympic medals for marksmanship, but now spends his days as an al-Qaeda sniper, picking off American soldiers as they go about their noble work.</p> \n<p>The Butcher is evil personified. He uses a power drill to torture a child to death in front of his screaming family. His workshop in a disused restaurant looks like the set for a cooking show hosted by Hannibal Lecter: a chained, mangled corpse dangles from the kitchen ceiling, and larder shelves are piled with dismembered body parts.<span> </span></p> \n<p><span>Mustafa, on the other hand, is Bizarro Chris Kyle. He's equally skilled with a rifle, but instead of heroically protecting American troops, he's picking them off, one by one. You know, </span><i style=""font-size: 1.15em; line-height: 1.88888895511628;"">evilly</i><span>.</span></p> \n<h3><span>The movie's ""sheep"" problem</span></h3> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3327842/shutterstock_244788025.0.jpg"" alt=""Sheep"" data-chorus-asset-id=""3327842""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">(Shutterstock.com)</p> \n<p>The movie's ""sheep"" problem is equally disturbing. The sheep are not the Iraqi civilians terrorized by the Butcher. With the exception of one murdered child and his payoff-demanding father, the Iraqis in the film are pretty much all terrorists or terrorist sympathizers. Rather, the sheep Kyle protects are the other American soldiers. For a movie that's been lauded for its support of the troops, that's a surprisingly disdainful view of their bravery and skill.</p> \n<p>In the movie's telling, ordinary soldiers' lack of SEAL training makes them sitting ducks (sitting sheep?) for insurgent attacks. At one point, Kyle leaves his sniper's perch to lead a group of Marines as they clear buildings in Fallujah, telling the awed soldiers, <span>who burst with gratitude that the hero Chris Kyle has deigned to join them,</span><span> that he can show them a thing or two. Even Kyle's own brother is given sheep status: when he deploys with the Marines, it's cause for family concern, not celebration of his heroism. And when Kyle sees him later on an Iraqi airstrip, he's shaking with exhaustion from battlefield trauma.</span></p> \n<p>A different movie might have acknowledged that those soldiers were, in many ways, more heroic than Kyle. They took greater risks with less training, and many of them lost their lives in battle as a result. <i>American Sniper</i>, on the other hand, presents them as an undifferentiated mass of grunts, waiting for Chris Kyle to save them.</p> \n<p>Worse, the<span> movie's sheep-wolves-sheepdog narrative implicitly blames them for their own peril. The ""sheep"" are in danger because they are too naive to understand the evil in the world, </span><span>not just because they are under-trained or under-resourced</span><span>.</span></p> \n<p><span></span><span>The movie is very clear on that point. In a scene depicting the funeral of Marc Lee, Kyle's friend and fellow SEAL who was killed in action, his mother reads a moving</span><a href=""http://americasmightywarriors.org/_a/marcs-last-letter-home/""> letter </a><span>Lee wrote a few weeks before his death, in which he questions the legitimacy of wartime glory, and worries that it can lead to an ""unjustified crusade."" It seems, for a moment, like the film might be attempting to grapple with the justness of the war itself, or at least consider the possibility that a person could be both heroic as an individual, and ambivalent about the greater mission.</span></p> \n<p><span></span><span>Nope.</span></p> \n<p>Instead, the following scene features an angry rant from Kyle, who insists that ""that letter"" killed Marc, not the bullet that hit him. In the world of American Sniper, doubting your role as champion of good and enemy of evil is a fatal condition.</p> \n<h3>The ""sheepdog"" problem</h3> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3327852/shutterstock_245292823.0.jpg"" alt=""Sheepdog"" data-chorus-asset-id=""3327852""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">(Shutterstock.com)</p> \n<p>That with-us-or against us construction is a problem, because the movie isn't just selling a vision of the Iraq War, it's selling a vision of violence as the only effective resistance to the forces of evil.</p> \n<p>In the movie, Kyle is infallible. We never once see him shoot a civilian who he mistakes for a combatant. When another soldier tells him that the wife of one of Kyle's ""kills"" claims he was carrying a Koran, not a gun, Kyle dismisses his concerns by saying  ""I don't know what a Koran looks like,"" before describing in detail the exact type of gun the man was holding.</p> \n<p>When Kyle shoots a young child and a woman in an early scene, the film is careful to show the grenade they were carrying exploding, leaving no doubt that Kyle was correct about the danger they posed to nearby American troops. <span>In a climactic scene, when Kyle disobeys an order to hold his fire and nearly gets his entire team killed, the movie still eventually validates his decision: he kills the bad guy, and all the good guys survive unharmed. </span></p> \n<p>That reinforces the movie's construct of good vs. evil — sheep vs. wolves. Because Kyle is always right, any limits on his use of violence would, by definition, leave American soldiers in danger. That's something only a naive sheep could want.</p> \n<p>But pretending that heroic sheepdog warriors never accidentally kill civilians is a dangerous lie about the true nature of combat. <span>In the real world, even well-intentioned soldiers do sometimes kill innocent people, because that is how war works.</span><span> </span></p> \n<p><span>Pretending otherwise is an insult to the many American veterans who have to spend the rest of their lives grappling with their actions during the Iraq War, and to the thousands of innocent Iraqis who have been killed since the conflict began. And it's also dangerous, because it tells Americans not to worry about the harm our wars may do to civilians, who are probably all terrorists anyway. </span><span>It's bad enough to hide that truth behind euphemisms like ""collateral damage,"" but much worse to write it out of the story completely.</span></p> \n<h3><span>The result: recruitment propaganda for an imaginary war</span></h3> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3327854/American_Sniper_Tweets.0.jpg"" alt=""American Sniper Tweets"" data-chorus-asset-id=""3327854""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">(<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://twitter.com/LeslieK_nope/status/556928012730773506"">Cryanne</a>)</p> \n<p>Given all of that, it is hardly surprising that <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://twitter.com/LeslieK_nope/status/556928012730773506"">many viewers</a> appear to have absorbed <i>American Sniper</i>'s message as ""Muslims are evil and should be killed.""</p> \n<p><span></span>It would be bad enough if this were merely a shockingly inaccurate portrayal of the Iraq War and an appallingly insulting one of Iraqis themselves. <span>But it's worse, because this movie feeds the narrative that the civilized world is at war with Muslims, that the only solution is to respond with crushing violence, and that people who refuse to believe that are naïfs — sheep, rather — who are dangerously undermining America's security. </span></p> \n<p><span>That's not a story that's limited to Clint-Eastwood-directed warsploitation movies. You'll hear the same thing on Fox News, where this month </span><a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/1/12/7533159/fox-news-pirro-rant"" target=""_blank"" style=""font-size: 1.15em; line-height: 1.88888895511628; background-color: #ffffff;"">Jeanine Pirro </a><span>delivered a bloodthirsty rant calling for mass murder as a solution to the problem of Muslim extremism, and the network repeatedly made the false claim that radical Islamists had taken over parts of European cities, turning them into </span><span>Muslim-only </span><a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/1/16/7553975/fox-no-go-zones"">""no-go"" zones</a><span>. </span></p> \n<p>That's its own form of dangerous extremism. Its premises are wrong, and its results are dangerous. By feeding that narrative, <i>American Sniper</i> is part of the problem.</p>",Movies

Pollution is changing the way China does politics,http://www.vox.com/2015/3/10/8183881/pollution-is-changing-the-way-china-does-politics, ,"<p>Ever since 1989, when troops massacred hundreds of protesters around Beijing’s Tiananmen Square, China's ruling Communist Party has built its legitimacy on a bargain with the people that is unspoken but universally understood: the Party promises economic growth, and citizens don't make a fuss about the absence of democracy and the freedoms that go with it.</p> \n<p>But that bargain is changing. And there are signs of it, however subtle, in the drama surrounding a viral video that gripped the nation this past week.</p> \n<h3>Why China censored a viral video its own minister had promoted</h3> \n<p>A Chinese documentary about the country’s notoriously bad pollution, ""Under the Dome,"" hit the internet on February 28. At first, some in government signaled support — it was good for citizens to care about their environment.</p> \n<p>""I think this work has an important role in promoting public awareness of environmental health issues, so I’m particularly pleased about this event,"" the country's new environmental minister, Chen Jining, told a press conference three days later.</p> \n<p>But when the film became too wildly popular,  attracting at least 200 million views, government censors <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/mar/09/chinese-pollution-documentary-under-the-dome-taken-offline-government"">moved to block it</a>. Some officials had <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/07/world/asia/china-blocks-web-access-to-documentary-on-nations-air-pollution.html?_r=0"">strongly criticized</a> the video. The conversations around it had just become too sensitive.</p> \n<p> </p> \n<p class=""p1""><q class=""center"" aria-hidden=""true"">the film became too wildly popular, attracting at least 200 million views</q></p> \n<p>Still, China has about 641 million internet users, which means something like a third of the country's total online population may have seen ""Under the Dome"" before it was taken down. It captured the public imagination, and in that we can see the contours of a different bargain between the party and the people taking shape.</p> \n<p>The basic demands of the people are stretching beyond ""make us richer""; these days, it’s ""give us a decent quality of life; let our children breathe clean air and eat safe food.""</p> \n<p>The next question, of course, is: ""Or what?"" The Party, obsessed since Tiananmen with maintaining stability, doesn’t want to find out the answer to that — and its sometimes-contradictory responses to popular dissent and to pollution are, at base, driven by fear.</p> \n<h3>""Unprecedented in China's internet history""</h3> \n<p>""Under the Dome"" is a detailed look at the causes and effects of the thick smog that regularly chokes Chinese cities. It’s still available on YouTube with English subtitles:</p> \n<p><iframe width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/T6X2uwlQGQM"" frameborder=""0""></iframe></p> \n<p>Across the country, millions have been talking about it. China analyst Michael Zhao called the hype around the film ""<a href=""http://www.chinafile.com/conversation/why-has-environmental-documentary-gone-viral-chinas-internet"">unprecedented in China’s Internet history</a>.""</p> \n<p>In it, presenter Chai Jing, a former veteran reporter with state-run news network CCTV, shares her worries about the effects the acrid air of Beijing is having on her baby daughter.</p> \n<p>""Already on the way home from the hospital, I started to feel scared,"" she says. ""The smell of black smoke and burning fire was everywhere.""</p> \n<p>Her concerns struck a chord with many urban, middle-class Chinese, who face the same issues as her — and their government is under pressure to do something about it.</p> \n<h3>China’s shifting bargain with the people</h3> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""3489920"" alt=""A family walks near Tiananmen Square on a smoggy day"" src=""https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3489920/457525034.0.jpg""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">A family walks near Tiananmen Square in Beijing on a smoggy day.

Since moving to a market economy in the late 1970s, China has averaged about 10 percent growth a year, lifting more than </span><a href=""http://www.worldbank.org/en/country/china/overview"" style=""font-size: 1.15em; line-height: 1.65; background-color: #ffffff;"">500 million people out of poverty</a><span>.</span></p> \n<p>The problem for the Communist Party is that its success could prove its undoing: decades of rapid growth have transformed the country, creating a huge urban middle class.</p> \n<p>Just a generation ago, with the experiences of the <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jan/01/china-great-famine-book-tombstone"">horrifying famine</a> caused by the Great Leap Forward that began in the 1950s and the Cultural Revolution in the '60s and '70s, Chinese families were focused on fulfilling basic needs such as food.</p> \n<p>These days, aspirations go beyond that. That does not mean citizens are demanding the kind of democratic rights the Tiananmen protesters sought. But they do include having a government that will fix the slew of health and environmental problems plaguing China — not just the terrible air pollution, but everything from <a href=""http://www.cnn.com/2013/09/05/world/asia/china-river-dead-fish/"">poisoned soil and rivers</a> to the shoddy <a href=""http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-23316125"">food standards</a> that left hundreds of thousands of babies sick from tainted milk in 2008.</p> \n<p>Many <a href=""http://fortune.com/2014/06/05/china-rich-immigration/"">emigrating wealthy Chinese</a> cite pollution as a top reason for leaving — evidence enough for Party leaders that they have a potential crisis on their hands.

There have been a flurry of environmental measures announced, and lots of promises from politicians. Premier Li Keqiang called pollution ""a blight on people’s quality of life and a trouble that weighs on their hearts"" as he opened the annual session of the National People’s Congress last week.</p> \n<p>This is meant to manage not just the environmental problems but the public frustration they're causing. Publicly acknowledging there is a problem relieves some pressure <span>—</span><span> and so, too, does allowing a little room for criticism online. That’s surely why censors initially allowed discussion of the film, so long as it wasn’t critical of the government. But anything that looks like it could be spilling into a source of instability, as the documentary apparently was, must be wiped from the internet.</span></p> \n<p>Barbara A. Finamore, a China specialist at the National Resources Defense Council, <a href=""http://www.chinafile.com/conversation/why-has-environmental-documentary-gone-viral-chinas-internet"">pointed out</a> that the ruckus over the film coincides with the Chinese government’s ""two most important annual meetings: full sessions of the 12th National People’s Congress (NPC) and the 12th Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC).""</p> \n<p>""This documentary and its wildfire popularity may prove to be a watershed moment influencing China’s environmental policy,"" she added.</p> \n<p>If the tremendous interest in the film shows anything, it’s that this issue is not going away.

"This single-take, 3-minute fight scene from Daredevil is fantastic",http://www.vox.com/2015/4/14/8406649/daredevil-one-take-hallway-fight-scene,It's the perfect homage to Oldboy and The Raid.,"<p>The signature scene of Netflix's new Marvel superhero series <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/4/13/8397195/daredevil-review-netflix-marvel""><i>Daredevil</i></a> comes at the tail end of the show's second episode, ""Cut Man."" Matt Murdock (Charlie Cox) — a.k.a. Daredevil — bursts into the villains' den looking for a missing boy. From there, we're treated to a bone-crunching fight through the guts of a seedy New York City building.</p> \n<p>Doors bust open. People get microwaves chucked at their heads. Bodies contort and twist with every punch. And it all happens in one, continuous shot.</p> \n<p>The scene is a three-minute declaration that this superhero series came ready to play. Here's what makes it so good:</p> \n<h3>The wonder of the one-shot fight scene</h3> \n<p>The brilliance of this one-take scene is as much about the difficulty of nailing down the fight choreography as it is the final product. <i>Daredevil</i>'s stunt coordinator, Philip J. Silvera, explained to <a href=""http://observer.com/2015/04/daredevil-stunt-coordinator-on-designing-a-one-shot-fight-scene-for-a-blind-hero/"" target=""_blank"">the Observer</a> that the scene was actually proposed as a challenge.</p> \n<p>""Phil [director Phil Abraham] challenged us to do a pure one-shot, which really just brought a grounded real feeling to the whole thing,"" Silvera said. ""We were able to slow down the fight and just have this raw, animalistic feeling happening.""</p> \n<p>Silvera explained that though there were no cuts used in the sequence, around eight stunt doubles took part in the scene. The doubles were swapped in and out during moments in the shot where the audience's view is obstructed:</p> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3602596/2015-04-13_22_12_46.0.gif"" alt=""2015-04-13_22_12_46.0.gif"" data-chorus-asset-id=""3602596""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">This is a part where the action is purposely obscured to swap stunt doubles. (Marvel/Netflix)</p> \n<p>""Every performer, the actors and the stunt doubles, were in there performing that fight full-on. I'd say there was a minimum of 105 beats, and they killed it,"" Silvera told <a href=""http://observer.com/2015/04/daredevil-stunt-coordinator-on-designing-a-one-shot-fight-scene-for-a-blind-hero/"" target=""_blank"">the Observer</a>.</p> \n<p>Silvera and Abraham's challenge is just one part of the equation. Their balletic final product makes the payoff that much better. The movement of the fight is easy for the eye to follow. There's also a balanced and methodical use of shadow, color, and light. And there's a constant movement of the camera  — shifting backward, forward, left, and right; resting on different planes; and forcing the audience to adjust to different depths and perspectives.</p> \n<h3>\n<span>An homage to</span><em> Oldboy</em><span> and </span><em>The Raid</em>\n</h3> \n<p>Upon seeing this sequence, fans began pointing out two likely inspirations. The first is Park Chan-wook's 2003 film <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0364569/""><i>Oldboy</i></a><i>. </i>In that film, the hero, Oh Dae-su, travels back to a clandestine prison where he was held captive without explanation. He must fight through a mob to get deeper into the prison:</p> \n<p><iframe width=""560"" height=""315"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/-OzB-mop6AA"" frameborder=""0""></iframe></p> \n<p>Though both of these sequences were shot in continuous takes, <i>Oldboy </i>'s sequence is very different. The most obvious contrast between the two is that <i>Oldboy </i>features a wider, more static shot — there's no movement like there is in <i>Daredevil</i>. We witness the action from the X-axis, slowly going from left to right. This plays up the sheer number of men Oh Dae-su must vanquish in order to get to his destination.</p> \n<p>The other movie this sequence riffs on is <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1899353/""><i>The Raid: Redemption</i></a><i>, </i>a 2011 film from Gareth Evans. (<i>Daredevil</i> showrunner <a href=""http://www.ew.com/article/2015/04/07/daredevil-netflix-superhero"" target=""_blank""><b>Steve DeKnight told <i>EW</i></b></a> that <i>The Raid</i> was one of his inspirations for the show's fight scenes.) The aesthetic is very similar to <i>Daredevil</i>'s in that the hero, Rama, fights through a hallway, a contained space, with enemies popping out from every direction:</p> \n<p><iframe frameborder=""0"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/uI-V0rrlZBo"" height=""315"" width=""560""></iframe> <br><i> The Raid</i>'s fight scene is a bit more frenetic than <i>Daredevil</i>'s<i>, </i>and it's not a true one-shot sequence, as there are a few jump cuts and closeups spliced in. But the two share a similar sense of design, movement, and action.</p> \n<h3>The hero has a ""human"" moment</h3> \n<p><!-- CHORUS_VIDEO_EMBED ChorusVideo:68864 --></p> \n<p>There's one more moment that Daredevil and Oldboy share. The pivotal similarity between <i>Daredevil</i> and <i>Oldboy</i> is that both possess a scene where our hero is beaten, and seemingly down for the count. In <i>Oldboy</i>, Oh Dae-su is overcome by the numbers, stomped on, and just about left for dead. <i>Daredevil</i>'s Matt Murdock succumbs to exhaustion.</p> \n<p>Both heroes crumple to the floor like worn sleeping bags. Heroes aren't supposed to be this vulnerable, nor are they supposed to have limits. For a brief moment, they're totally exposed. A final punch could end their run.</p> \n<p>But there's also a turn.</p> \n<p>In this moment, when our heroes have nothing left and the odds are stacked against them, they each find the faintest glimmer of strength and hold on. They're bruised, battered, and exhausted, but they're not done yet. Matt Murdock and Oh Dae-su pick themselves up off the ground, determined to make it through this gauntlet, no matter what it takes.</p>",Movies
Unfriended takes place on a single computer screen â€” and it works,http://www.vox.com/2015/4/17/8440133/unfriended-movie-review,Unfriended is far smarter and meaner than it looks.,"<p>Ghosts can kill you and your friends over Skype. But first the ghost in the machine will make your life a terrific hell — one instant message at a time.</p> \n<p>This is the core concept of <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3713166/""><em>Unfriended</em></a>, a found-footage horror movie from director Levan Gabriadze and writer Nelson Greaves that takes place entirely on the screen of a teenage girl's MacBook.<!--  ########  BEGIN SNIPPET  ########  --></p> \n<div class=""chorus-snippet ratingbox"">\n<!-- add number from 1 to 5 where the 3 is --> \n<div class=""rating-container""> \n<p>Rating</p> \n<hr> \n<span class=""rating-number"">3.5</span>\n</div> \n</div> \n<!--  ########  END SNIPPET  ########  --> \n<p><br id=""1429284162296""></p> \n<p> </p> \n<p>As silly as the premise might sound, <em>Unfriended</em> is actually a surprisingly clever movie. It's far smarter and meaner than it looks.</p> \n<p>The story begins and ends on the laptop of a girl named Blaire (Shelley Hennig). It's shot from Blaire's first-person perspective, as she scans through various windows of Apple's iOS system, Google Chrome tabs, and Skype. (For an idea of what this is like, check out the <a href=""http://www.ropeofsilicon.com/noah-short-film-think-will-love/"">short film </a><a href=""http://www.ropeofsilicon.com/noah-short-film-think-will-love/""><em>Noah</em></a>.)</p> \n<p>Through Blaire's browsing habits, we learn of a girl named Laura Barns (Heather Sossaman), an embarrassing video of Laura that led to her suicide, and that Blaire and her friends played some kind of role in pushing Laura to that point. Someone or something on Laura's account messages these friends through Facebook and Skype, leading to the emotional collapse of some and the unraveling of friendships among others.</p> \n<p>While <em>Unfriended</em> is built around the bones of ghostly revenge, it's what the movie does in the margins, how it plays with ideas about communication and our attempts to retain complete control of our social identity, that's actually the most unnerving part.</p> \n<h3>\n<em>Unfriended</em> uses language we can understand</h3> \n<p><em>Unfriended</em>'s main conceit is that we witness everything through Blaire's computer screen. Every sensory aspect of the movie, from the music that plays (Spotify) to the establishing shots (Skype) to dialogue (iMessage), is tied back to this computer screen.</p> \n<p>There's a familiar rhythm to how Blaire fiddles around with her computer and flips through the windows on screen. Part of that comes from how familiar most of us are with the interface. By now, we intuitively know what a Facebook alert sounds like, and how it's different from a Skype phone call's ring. And most of us know what the gray bubble means on an iMessage.</p> \n<p><em>Unfriended</em> plays off of this, knowing where viewers' eyes will go when an alert pops up or what they'll feel when Blaire gets a message on Skype.</p> \n<p>It's a bit voyeuristic, too. There were points throughout the film where I found myself looking at Blaire's tabs (<em>Teen Wolf </em>and Forever 21), her Google auto-completes, and her Facebook messages for other clues about this character, her relationship to her friends, and her relationship to Laura.</p> \n<h3>\n<em>Unfriended</em> makes mean <em>Mean Girls</em> look dated</h3> \n<p>When it was released, <em>Mean Girls </em>was lauded for the way it portrayed catty, teenage friendships and the way — as in the biting three-way-call scenes — sabotage occurred.</p> \n<p><em>Unfriended</em> works the same way but takes it to a new level.</p> \n<p>There's a layer of chat where Blaire and her friends, Adam (Will Peltz), Jess (Renee Olstead), and Ken (Jacob Wysocki) interact. But then Blaire moves into a more private chat with her boyfriend, Mitch (Moses Jacob Storm), to talk about their other friends. Blaire also talks with whoever is on Laura's account via Facebook messenger.</p> \n<p>Talking behind a friend's back is different when you don't need to talk to someone face to face. There's a lack of humanity there. And it makes bullying both easier and even colder.</p> \n<p>Val (Courtney Halverson) is introduced as someone the rest of the group hates. She's not in on the spooky, initial Skype call that brings all these teens together. It allows them to talk about how much they dislike her. It colors the way we process her character and what we expect. And when Val is brought on to the group call, we see the teens shift into more civil versions of themselves, barely hinting at the vitriol they're all keeping under the surface.</p> \n<p>Val, of course, is no saint. But the point the film makes is more about the secrecy and lack of humanity in which we operate, and how our digital lives allow us to really lean into that.</p> \n<h3>Perhaps the scariest thing is when we're not in control of our own identities</h3> \n<p>One of the points <em>Unfriended</em> drives home is that we're very much in control of our image because we, more than ever, are in control of the way we communicate.</p> \n<p>Since so much of our lives unfolds via text, we can write and rewrite sentences over and over. A period here, an extra couple of words there, or a ""hi"" instead of ""hello"" can change the way we come across. On Facebook or Twitter, we create an identity through a pastiche of pictures, ""likes,"" and messages. Even on video chat, we can see how we look and change our posture or alter our body language.</p> \n<p>We use this identity-altering power to make ourselves seem like people we'd approve of. That's why we ""share"" the things we do and ""like"" the things we like.</p> \n<p>The teens of <em>Unfriended</em> learn that the absence of this control is just as terrifying as any ghost. Embarrassing pictures are posted without their permission. They get tagged in videos they want no part of. It all seems superficial and perhaps silly, since it's not happening directly to us.</p> \n<p>But <em>Unfriended</em> wants to pose a question: is the idea of people finding out you're an awful person scarier than a haunting? Is that life even worth living? There are moments where <em>Unfriended</em> wants to make clear that at least for these teens, that reality is terrifying. This ""ghost"" could easily be a hacker, and could ruin the teens' lives as much as any paranormal force.</p> \n<p>Ultimately, Blaire and her friends realize just how little they know each other. The way they think about each other is largely dependent on what they put into the social media ether.</p> \n<p>What if the person you're dating isn't a virgin, as he or she told you? What if your best friend is really the guy who sold you out to the cops? What if your crush is actually a rapist?</p> \n<p>Knowing your friends' deepest, darkest secrets — and knowing your own could be exposed — might make you want to take your chances with an angry ghost. At least you know where the two of you stand.</p>",Movies
Netflix is defending the Adam Sandler movie that Native American actors say is racist,http://www.vox.com/2015/4/24/8491549/adam-sandler-native-american-movie,Itâ€™s always the people making the offensive jokes who get the final word on whatâ€™s funny.,"<p id=""ember862""> </p> \n<ol> \n<li><span>A group of Native American actors working on Adam Sandler's latest movie walked off the set this week, calling the script ""totally disrespectful to elders and Native women.""</span></li> \n<li> Actor Loren Anthony <a style=""font-size: 1.15em; line-height: 1.65; background-color: #ffffff;"" href=""http://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/movies/native-american-actors-walk-set-adam-sandler-movie-over-racist-n347321"" target=""_blank"">told the Associated Press</a> that he and eight others quit after <i>The Ridiculous Six</i> producers ignored their concerns about the use of offensive names for Native American female characters, and a scene in which a Native American woman urinated while smoking a peace pipe. </li> \n<li><span>The film is the first in a four-movie deal between Sandler and Netflix, which has defended the humor, saying in a statement to NBC News, ""The movie has 'ridiculous' in the title for a reason: because it is ridiculous. It is a broad satire of Western movies and the stereotypes they popularized, featuring a diverse cast that is not only part of — but in on — the joke.""</span></li> \n</ol> \n<h3>Comedy and bigotry meet again</h3> \n<p>There's no consensus on when satire that relies on racism, sexism, or other kinds of stereotypes goes too far, whether jokes have to ""punch up"" — focus on the most privileged groups — to be funny, or who gets to decide whether comedy that offends is worth the laughs.</p> \n<p>These questions come up pretty frequently, though. Most recently, Trevor Noah, the newly announced successor to <i>The</i> <i>Daily Show</i>'s Jon Stewart, <a href=""http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/237462-new-daily-show-host-faces-outrage-over-antisemitic-tweets"" target=""_blank"">was criticized</a> for tweeting jokes that relied on anti-Semitic stereotypes and attacks on women's weight.</p> \n<p>Noah defended himself, tweeting, ""To reduce my views to a handful of jokes that didn't land is not a true reflection of my character, nor my evolution as a comedian,"" and Comedy Central backed him up, <a href=""http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/comedy-central-defends-daily-show-host-trevor-noah/story?id=30035548"" target=""_blank"">issuing a statement that</a> sounds very much like the one Netflix offered this week: ""Like many comedians, Trevor Noah pushes boundaries; he is provocative and spares no one, himself included.""</p> \n<h3>When defenses of humor get depressing</h3> \n<p>""We talked to the producers about our concerns,"" another Native American <i>Ridiculous Six</i> actor, Allison Young, told the <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2015/04/24/adam-sandler-is-awful-and-its-all-our-fault/"" target=""_blank"">Washington Post.</a> ""They just told us, ‘If you guys are so sensitive, you should leave.' I was just standing there and got emotional and teary-eyed. I didn't want to cry but the feeling just came over me. This is supposed to be a comedy that makes you laugh. A film like this should not make someone feel this way.""</p> \n<p>It would be naive to expect people who make comedy to care more about the people they might hurt than they do about their bottom line, or to expect all Americans to laugh at the same punchlines.  Still, while good humor is subjective, a pretty clear sign that it's failed is when you have to explain, like Netflix did, to people who are literally crying how they're in on the joke and why it's funny.</p>",Movies

Sharknado 3: 7 important lessons from this cultural institution,http://www.vox.com/2015/7/23/9023621/sharknado-7-important-lessons,"When in doubt, grab an American flag.","<p>On Wednesday night, the great American tradition of whirlwind-riding sharks destroying cities and eating various C-list celebrities was reignited. <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3899796/""><em>Sharknado 3 </em></a><a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3899796/"">premiered on SyFy</a>.</p> \n<p>The <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3899796/""><em>Sharknado</em></a> franchise, like the McRib or the KFC Double Down, has become an American cultural institution bringing together America's love of severe weather phenomena and large fish.</p> \n<p>But deep down in its submarine guts, the <em>Sharknado</em> franchise also reflects larger issues that occupy the American conscience like (we think) gun control, (maybe) space exploration, and city life. Here are some of the things we learned about <em>Sharknado 3</em>, and, ultimately, ourselves:</p> \n<h3>1) The only thing that stops a bad sharknado is a good guy with a gun</h3> \n<p>The first part of <em>Sharknado 3</em> is essentially an NRA fever dream. President Mark Cuban and Finn Shepard (<a href=""http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005575/?ref_=tt_cl_t1"">Ian Ziering</a>) find themselves in the middle of a sharknado, but Cuban's security detail will not let Shepard have a gun because he doesn't have clearance. The shark storm then teaches the president's Secret Service a vital lesson, as all are taken out by various sharks.</p> \n<p>If only they'd let Shepard hold a gun.</p> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""3900330"">\n<img src=""https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3900330/giphy%20(18).gif""> \n<div class=""caption""> \n<p>(Sharknado 3)</p> \n</div> \n</div> \n<p>Ergo, gun control is stupid in times of natural disasters like a sharknado. Everyone needs a gun. And if you want to survive, you better hope Shepard has one too.</p> \n<h3>2) Use American flags in place of chainsaws</h3> \n<p>The most thrilling moment of the garbage fire of a film known as <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005575/?ref_=tt_cl_t1""><em>Sharknado 2</em></a> was a scene in which Shepard revs up a chainsaw and, holding it like an electric guitar, saws an oncoming shark in two:</p> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""3900746"">\n<img src=""https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3900746/2014-07-29_10_54_24.gif""> \n<div class=""caption""> \n<p>(Sharknado 3)</p> \n</div> \n</div> \n<p>The third installment of the franchise had its eyes on the prize, seeking to top that moment with a dose of Americana, Ann Coulter, Mark McGrath, and the sentiment that these colors don't run:</p> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""3900738"">\n<img src=""https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3900738/2015-07-23%2010_53_19.gif""> \n<div class=""caption""> \n<p>(Sharknado 3)</p> \n</div> \n</div> \n<h3>3) There were some very thirsty people in this movie</h3> \n<p>Thirst is the sweet spot between eagerness and desperation. And this is far and away the thirstiest, most cameo-riddled television movie ever created. The <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3899796/"">movie's cameos had cameos</a>, ranging form Lou Ferrigno to Jackie Collins to David Hasselhoff to Anthony Weiner.</p> \n<p>These people have all been (or still are), major fixtures in pop culture. In Weiner's case, he was a lawmaker who was voted in because people thought he could better their lives, and now he's in the third <em>Sharknado</em> movie. This is the world we live in. <em>Sharknado</em> operates like a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katamari"">katamari</a>, and there will come a point in the future where more people will appear in <em>Sharknado</em> films than not.</p> \n<h3>4) Yes, that was George R. R. Martin getting killed</h3> \n<p>The <em>Game of Thrones</em> creator was one of the film's many cameos. <a href=""https://twitter.com/georgerrmartin_/status/494854835972239362"">Martin had expressed that he was a fan of the movies</a>, and now was his time to shine. He lasted about as long as one of his <em>GoT</em> characters:</p> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""3900468"">\n<img src=""https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3900468/GEEEORGE.gif""> \n<div class=""caption""> \n<p>(Sharknado 3)</p> \n</div> \n</div> \n<h3>5) Washington, DC, is ill-equipped to deal with a sharknado</h3> \n<p>In the world of <em>Sharknado</em>, New York City and Los Angeles turned into shark-infested death traps. The Big Apple's subway system became its undoing, while the City of Angels found itself unprepared to deal with the torrential deluge that accompanies a sharknado. Sharknados only seem to plague big cities, and it all feels like a plea to move to the country.</p> \n<p>Would DC, the nation's capital, fare any different?</p> \n<p>Nope:</p> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""3900764"">\n<img src=""https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3900764/lincolnshark.gif""> \n<div class=""caption""> \n<p>(Sharknado 3)</p> \n</div> \n</div> \n<h3>6) If you're trapped in space, find a shark</h3> \n<p>I was not the biggest fan of <em>Gravity. </em>I understand I'm in the minority, but I found my people — and those people are the producers and writers of <em>Sharknado 3</em>. Thanks to its own crooked science (sharks can still eat you in space) and faulty logic (pregnant women apparently want to go to space) the movie sent sharks into the heavens.</p> \n<p>But it did not stop there.</p> \n<p>A shark eats a pregnant April Wexler (Tara Reid), who somehow manages to give birth inside the shark, use the shark's body as fishy armor upon reentry into Earth's atmosphere, and then cut herself out with her bionic saw hand. After all this, a cliffhanger leaves April's lives in the hands of a <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/aprilives"">Twitter hashtag</a> (more on that below).</p> \n<p>This is how <em>Gravity</em> should have ended, <em>Sharknado 3</em> asserts with two middle fingers held up to the sky. And I wholeheartedly agree.</p> \n<h3>7) <em>Sharknado</em> isn't immortal</h3> \n<p>After <em>Sharknado</em>, there was feeling that there would be no possible way to top that movie. Then <em>Sharknado 2,</em> with Tara Reid's saw hand and the single greatest chainsaw scene ever created, showed itself. In the third installment, we have sharknados in space and people giving birth inside sharks.</p> \n<blockquote lang=""en"" class=""twitter-tweet""> \n<p dir=""ltr"" lang=""en"">Raise your hands if you want a chainsaw hand. <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/Sharknado3?src=hash"">#Sharknado3</a> cc: <a href=""https://twitter.com/TaraReid"">@TaraReid</a> <a href=""http://t.co/X82EKTPVRq"">pic.twitter.com/X82EKTPVRq</a></p> \n— Sharknado (@SharknadoSyfy) <a href=""https://twitter.com/SharknadoSyfy/status/624030395726737408"">July 23, 2015</a>\n</blockquote> \n<p> \n<script charset=""utf-8"" src=""//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js""></script> \n</p> \n<p> </p> \n<p>And in the fourth film viewers, will be able to decide whether April lives or dies based on a Twitter hashtag. This, I believe, will be the franchise's final installment.</p> \n<p>You see, <em>Sharknado</em> works because of its complete disregard of its audience. No one asked us if we wanted chainsaws and sharks, bionic limbs with buzzsaws, or sharks in space. There's something surprising and refreshing in that defiance. <em>Sharknado 3'</em>s ending feels like the beginning of the franchise's eventual end.</p> \n<p>To be clear, sending the sharks into space also represents an ending of sorts. Where else is there to go? Mars? Another galaxy? An alien civilization? Earth — our world, our rules, and our science — seems finite compared with the vast possibility of <em>Sharknado, </em>and the franchise would need to transcend our limits to really live on after this film.</p> \n<p>But killing off April or letting her live should be a decision made by people behind the scenes, not by the viewers. After all, <em>Sharknado</em> never asked for permission before. That's what made it so great.</p> \n<!--  ########  BEGIN VOLUME VIDEO  ########  --> \n<div class=""volume-video"" id=""volume-placement-2806"" data-volume-placement=""article"" data-analytics-placement=""entry:middle"" data-volume-id=""2365"" data-volume-uuid=""79dc33cfa"" data-analytics-label=""Why fewer computer graphics make for better movies | 2365"" data-analytics-action=""volume:view:entry:middle"" data-analytics-viewport=""video""></div> \n<!--  ########  END VOLUME VIDEO  ########  -->",Movies
"Pixels, Adam Sandler's newest movie, is complete and utter garbage",http://www.vox.com/2015/7/24/9032149/pixels-review-garbage,"Pixels is a crime against video games, women, and film.","<p><a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2120120/""><em>Pixels</em></a> is a movie.</p> \n<p>This is the nicest thing I can say about it. It is a motion picture in the same way that any space with four walls and a window is considered a bedroom in Manhattan, and in the same way that lampreys are fish. It's not so much a film as it is an all-out assault on the senses, a middle finger to anyone with a brain. It's an open taunt, daring people (and their children) to spend money on a gaping malpractice of creativity.</p> \n<p><!--  ########  BEGIN SNIPPET  ########  --></p> \n<div class=""chorus-snippet ratingbox"">\n<!-- add number from 1 to 5 where the 3 is --> \n<div class=""rating-container""> \n<p>Rating</p> \n<hr> \n<span class=""rating-number"">0</span>\n</div> \n</div> \n<!--  ########  END SNIPPET  ########  --> \n<p><br id=""1437751641693""></p> \n<p> </p> \n<p>""You know Space Invaders?"" Sam Brenner, a former video game wunderkind played by <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001191/?ref_=tt_cl_t1"" target=""_blank"">Adam Sandler</a>, asks Ludlow Lamonsoff (<a href=""http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1265802/?ref_=tt_cl_t5"" target=""_blank"">Josh Gad</a>). ""Because you're invading my space.""</p> \n<p>That's actually one of the film's better jokes. The rest tend to float around, mealy bits of sexism and archaic stereotypes in <em>Pixel</em><i>s</i>' fetid green pond of humor. <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2120120/?ref_=ttmd_md_nm"" target=""_blank""><i>Pixels</i></a><em>,</em> directed by Chris Columbus, written by Tim Herlihy and Timothy Dowling, and produced by the slop shop that is Happy Madison, holds being aggressively lazy as its main ambition. In this world, men are literally rewarded with beautiful women as prizes, dorks are still basement dwellers living with their mothers, kids have hot moms, and Kevin James is president of the United States.</p> \n<p>But the movie's worst sin — aside from believing that Kevin James could win a general election — is that it manages to deface the culture it wants to affectionately revere. This is supposed to be a movie about video games, the endless joy and entertainment they can bring, and how we've lost those feelings over time. But the people writing and creating this movie don't seem to care enough to do any of these ideas justice — or make a movie at all worth it.</p> \n<h3>\n<em>Pixels</em> plays on nostalgia but doesn't understand it</h3> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""3904294"" alt=""MV5BMTYwMDk4ODA4OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjMxODcyNjE_._V1__SX1359_SY583_.0.jpg"" src=""https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3904294/MV5BMTYwMDk4ODA4OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjMxODcyNjE_._V1__SX1359_SY583_.0.jpg""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">This movie defecates on Pac-Man's legacy. (Sony)</p> \n<p>No video game character has affected my life like Final Fantasy's Black Mage (and his assorted permutations). Tiny in stature, draped in a blue cloak, and sporting a bent witch's hat, this little guy can churn out devastating spells that break the sky with thunder and set the screen ablaze with flames.</p> \n<p>I remember relating to him because I, too, am fragile and not built for hand-to-hand combat. My parents wouldn't allow me to play during the week, but they did allow me to stay up and play for as long as I wanted on Friday and Saturday nights. When I think of those Friday nights, I remember drinking sugary sodas until my teeth tingled, staying up to cast one more spell, falling asleep with the game still buzzing, beating one last boss, and waiting all week to do it all over again.</p> \n<p>So <em>Pixels</em> should have been an easy sell to me.</p> \n<p>Yet after the initial flutters of joy in seeing Pac-Man blown up to the size of a house, I fell increasingly numb as I realized this film had no interest in exploring the magic of video games. <em>Pixels</em> knows Pac-Man will make its audience members feel things (nostalgia, awe, happiness), but it isn't interested in what those emotions are or why they exist.</p> \n<p>Instead, the characters and video games are shoved into an overcooked storyline where aliens picked up a transmission of our video games and took it as a threat. They weaponize our nostalgia, setting video game characters and loose as destructive forces on Earth. This isn't a bad premise — video games have often reacted to and reflected upon some of the darker parts of human existence, and it would be easy to see how an alien race could pick up on that.</p> \n<p>Yet <em>Pixels</em> doesn't.</p> \n<p>The film is intellectually lazy, and yet its plot is still somehow overwrought. No real logic centers the weaponized video game idea — Sandler and the rest of the earthlings play good characters in their first battle (Centipede) and bad (Pac-Man's ghosts) in another; there are cheat codes, but no explanation as to how to enter them. And the film is based on a bizarre plot hole: Why would aliens so powerful not just wipe out the planet instead of challenging its inhabitants to video game contests?</p> \n<p>Because our military isn't trained in video games (despite flying drones), it's up to old-school gamers, now fully grown man-children Brenner (Sandler), Lamonsoff (Gad), President Will Cooper (James), and Eddie Plant (Peter Dinklage) to save the day. (At moments, watching Gad and Dinklage, you almost have to wonder just what sort of leverage Sandler has over them.)</p> \n<p>Even when dealing with its heroes, <em>Pixels</em> is a lifeless letdown. These men are part of the dated joke that video game players live with their moms and are unattractive, sexually deprived creeps. It fails to recognize that we live in an age where geekdom and video games are mainstream, indelible parts of pop culture. Instead, <i>Pixels</i> is content to wallow in the man-baby fantasy of what someone who's never played video games thinks of the losers (""LOSERS! amirite!!!!?"") who do.</p> \n<h3>This might also be one of the most mind-bogglingly sexist movies ever created</h3> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""3904292"" alt=""MV5BMjA1OTMzMTAxN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTIxODcyNjE_._V1__SX1359_SY583_.0.jpg"" src=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3904292/MV5BMjA1OTMzMTAxN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTIxODcyNjE_._V1__SX1359_SY583_.0.jpg""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">The best actor in this photo is the orange guy. (Sony)</p> \n<p>One of the rules in <em>Pixels</em> is that when the humans win a video game battle (it's best two out of three), they are rewarded with a trophy. One of these trophies is Q-Bert, the trumpet-snouted, orange being who was somehow the hero of an '80s video game. Q-Bert ends up being one of the best actors in the movie, which says a lot since he basically snorts cheese balls and urinates himself.</p> \n<p>But the most startling thing that happens to Q-Bert is that the character eventually turns into a beautiful, silent (she does not speak) female ninja warrior (played by <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1667364/?ref_=tt_cl_t13"" target=""_blank"">Ashley Benson</a>), so that Lamonsoff is not left without a girlfriend at the end of the film.</p> \n<p>That turns out to be the basic premise of the film: Women are trophies made to be won.</p> \n<p>Serena Williams (in a cameo), Martha Stewart (also in said cameo), Jane Krakowski,  and <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1157358/?ref_=tt_cl_t3"" target=""_blank"">Michelle Monaghan</a> all appear in this film as objects of the men's desires. They are all severely underused, and are, with the exception of Krakowski who plays the first lady, won by the men by the end of the film. Krakowski, a gifted comedic actress (you might know her best as <em>30 Rock</em>'s Jenna), is given a paltry number of lines, two of which are devoted to asking Brenner how attractive Monaghan's character is.</p> \n<p>It all makes you wonder how desperate a time it is for women in Hollywood to sign on to play these parts.</p> \n<p>That's depressing, but disappointment is the underlying theme in <em>Pixels</em>. This movie could have been great. That moment of joy from seeing the video game characters of your childhood making a big-screen debut and glowing like radioactive candy is real — before it reveals itself to be just one moment in an endless trickle of listlessness.</p> \n<!--  ########  BEGIN VOLUME VIDEO  ########  --> \n<div class=""volume-video"" id=""volume-placement-48"" data-volume-placement=""article"" data-analytics-placement=""entry:middle"" data-volume-id=""2365"" data-volume-uuid=""79dc33cfa"" data-analytics-label=""Why fewer computer graphics make for better movies | 2365"" data-analytics-action=""volume:view:entry:middle"" data-analytics-viewport=""video""></div> \n<!--  ########  END VOLUME VIDEO  ########  -->",Movies

I can't fathom anyone wanting to hitch their name to this. If the <em>Fantastic Four</em> franchise were a <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/7/28/9064325/cecil-the-lion"" target=""_blank"">lion</a>, Trank, Kinberg, and Slater would be rotting in a jail cell in Zimbabwe.</p> \n<h3>\n<em>Fantastic Four</em> is the worst superhero movie in 20 years</h3> \n<p>""I'm an adult. I'm old enough to make my decisions,"" Johnny Storm (Michael B. Jordan) tells his father Franklin (Reg. E. Cathey).</p> \n<p>That's how the movie's characters speak when they're not dropping nods to the comics, like saying ""Dr. Doom over here"" to Dr. Doom (Toby Kebbell) or ""You're in your element"" to the Human Torch (Jordan). It's indicative of how Trank, Kinberg, and Slater approached this haphazard film. The story bends and shifts without any point. Plots are dropped, ignored, and spun at a whim. The characters' actions come out of nowhere, as if the only logic in this world is ""Because I said so.""</p> \n<p>The resulting movie feels like animus toward the source material. It outstinks the terrible <a href=""http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/wolverine/"" target=""_blank""><i>X-Men Origins — Wolverine</i></a>, and is the worst superhero movie since <a href=""http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1077027-batman_and_robin/"" target=""_blank""><i>Batman &amp; Robin</i></a>.</p> \n<h3>There's no reason for this movie to be this terrible</h3> \n<p>On paper, there's no reason that this film can't be good. Miles Teller, an edgeless, fleshy-lidded Shia LaBeouf, is the perfect combination of dick and dork to play the genius Reed Richards. Kate Mara was created in a laboratory to play Sue Storm. Michael B. Jordan and Jamie Bell are also talented, charismatic actors — the kind you need to play the Human Torch and the Thing, particularly the latter, who must emote through a heavy layer of CGI special effects. And Trank gave us <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1706593/"" target=""_blank""><i>Chronicle</i></a>, an inventive, found-footage take on the horror of giving superpowers to petulant teens.</p> \n<p>Plus, the Fantastic Four is the superhero team that defined superhero teams. Created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby, the four heroes — Reed has the power to stretch himself to impossible limits; Sue can create force fields and become invisible; Johnny can turn into a human fireball; Ben became a stone golem with incredible strength — are some of the most complex and riveting characters Marvel has ever created.</p> \n<p>They have opposing views of goodness and don't get along. They feel like they're monsters, but they're actually celebrities. They want to do good. They're selfless. They're family. Basically anything that we praise modern superhero tales for, the Fantastic Four were doing earlier and better.</p> \n<p>Thanks to thousands of pages of source material and 50 years of development, you could flip open any Fantastic Four comic book to a random page and find something interesting to put on screen. Instead, what Trank and friends have decided to do is spend 100 minutes stitching together five or six terrible mini-films, all falling over one another to be the last one standing.</p> \n<p>The most successful and endearing parts of the film are the first 20 minutes, which introduce Reed Richards and his pal Ben Grimm as children in Oyster Bay, New York. Reed is a nerd, Grimm is rough stuff, and together they build a machine that can transport people to a different dimension ... or planet ... or planet in another dimension (the film can't decide). There's a sense of wonderment (a nifty callback to the '60s-era space race that fueled the original comic book) that nearly evokes something magical like <em>E.T.</em> or <em>Super 8.</em></p> \n<p>Then, just when it gets good, it feels like whoever wrote those first 20 minutes went on an impromptu strike. The friendship plot line is dropped out of nowhere and not picked up again until the last act. We're instead thrust into a story about two dudes nerd-fighting over a girl. This is followed, for some reason, with commentary on baby boomers ruining Mother Earth, the government being terrible, and NASA being terrible, before we return to interdimensional space travel again. It's a massive jumble of aborted plot strands and ideas that go nowhere.</p> \n<p>Once the Four get their powers, however, things settle down a bit. For five minutes we get to take a breath and see something cool and inventive. What's interesting about the Four is that the powers they get make their lives a living hell — and some lives are more hellish than others. The Human Torch's fire consumes him, Invisible Woman drifts in and out of vision, Mr. Fantastic is stretched thin, and Grimm is a rocky, ugly monster.</p> \n<p>But then, as quickly as the characters get their powers, we're randomly pushed forward a year to when three of the four are training as government supersoldiers.</p> \n<p>If the movie had stayed on one path, it might have been decent. Cramming every single one of these haphazard plots into the same story, however, tanks it.</p> \n<h3>The last 20 minutes of <em>Fantastic Four</em> are so bad, it's funny</h3> \n<p>With all these mini-films fighting for dominance in this giant turd of a movie, everyone kind of forgets that the Fantastic Four need someone to fight. Thus, the last 20 minutes are devoted to checking off this one, final box.</p> \n<p>""We have to stop Victor. He is the source,"" are actual words said by alleged genius Reed Richards. He arrives at this revelation after Victor has already annihilated a government base and bested the Four in one fight. The declaration is said with the amount of enthusiasm you might have when accepting a lukewarm beer.</p> \n<p>The last fight scene is an orgy of bubbles, bad CGI, still shots of Dr. Doom, and misplaced lines. But what makes it so glorious is that the movie was so sparse on action sequences until this point. Could a massively exciting action sequence have pulled it out of its torpor? Maybe. There was a flicker of hope in my heart that Trank might pull it off, at least. But as with the rest of this Eeyore of a film, Trank manages to mosey sideways into the big action.</p> \n<p>People say only true fans will appreciate a bad movie — that they, the true believers, will find a way to mitigate hot awfulness and disappointment with empathy. Trank and his team have created the opposite of this: something that's openly hostile to anyone with a tiny bit of interest in the Fantastic Four.</p>",Movies

I still keep waiting for director Josh Trank to rip off his mask and reveal that this has been a terrifyingly nerdy long con by <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0361227/"">Ashton Kutcher and friends</a>.</p> \n<p><!--  ########  BEGIN SNIPPET  ########  --></p> \n<div class=""chorus-snippet s-related"" data-analytics-action=""link:related"" data-analytics-category=""article"">\n<span class=""s-related__title"">Related</span> <!-- Add links here --><a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/4/1/8129637/50-comic-books-that-explain-comic-books"">50 comic books that explain the comics industry today</a>\n</div> \n<p>This movie is just the latest footnote in what's been a long and sour 20 years for a team that was once considered Marvel's first family. The Fantastic Four have been in terrible movies, had their comic book adventures canceled, and, perhaps worst of all, been forgotten. But it wasn't always this way.</p> \n<p>Without them, Marvel and the heroes we love today would never have existed. The F4's comic book sales singlehandedly saved Marvel from an early death. And they weren't just popular for being popular — their stories, mainly revolving around family, resonated with readers. They also influenced the heroes who came after them. Without the Fantastic Four there would be no Spider-Man to teach us about power and responsibility, no Avengers bickering about what it means to be a hero, and no X-Men to show us what it's like to be outsiders.</p> \n<p>But over the past few years, the team has slowly been shelved. They perhaps aren't gritty enough to thrive in the post-9/11 comic book world. Superhero groups they used to overshadow, like the Avengers (yes, more on this in a bit) and the Guardians of the Galaxy, have overtaken them. And in true comic book fashion, the Fantastic Four became a sacrifice that allowed Marvel to survive — at their expense.</p> \n<p>The Fantastic Four are both Marvel's greatest creation and its greatest shame.</p> \n<h3>The Fantastic Four are  Marvel's origin story</h3> \n<p>There used to be a time when people who didn't read comic books distilled the industry into flat child's play and cast off its superheroes as gentle reading for unshorn minds and adult toddlers. But thanks to Marvel's sheer dominance, we're at a point in pop culture when people who don't even read comic books can tell you about <a href=""http://marvel.wikia.com/wiki/Groot_(Earth-616)"">Groot</a> or <a href=""http://marvel.com/universe/Thanos"">Thanos</a>. Marvel, no doubt, owes a large part of this success to brilliant moviemaking teams, the actors who brought these characters to life as well as the writers, artists, and creators who continue to write new comic book chapters in one of the most enduring and oldest continuous narratives alive today.</p> \n<p>But this success, and this comic book golden age, wouldn't even be possible without the Fantastic Four. Without them, you don't have Marvel.</p> \n<p>In 1961, when Marvel was on the precipice of failure, Stan Lee and Jack Kirby were tasked with creating something that could rival and rip off <a href=""http://www.dccomics.com/characters/justice-league"">DC Comics' Justice League</a>, the superhero team that included Superman and Wonder Woman. Sean Howe writes in his book <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Marvel-Comics-The-Untold-Story/dp/0061992119""><i>Marvel Comics: The Untold Story</i></a>:</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>[Publisher Martin Goodman] marched into the office with a mandate for Lee: steal this idea and create a team of superheroes. But Lee had been through attempted superhero revivals before. He went home to his wife, Joanie, and announced that he was finally going to quit. She talked him out of it. ""Just do it the way you want to,"" she insisted. ""Work your ideas into the comic book. What are they going to do, fire you?""</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Kirby, the legendary writer-artist, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Marvel-Comics-The-Untold-Story/dp/0061992119"">tells it differently</a>:</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>""Marvel was on its ass, literally, and when I came around, they were practically hauling out the furniture,"" Kirby said. ""They were beginning to move, and Stan Lee was sitting there crying. I told them to hold everything, and I pledged that I would give them the kind of books that would up their sales and keep them in business.""</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>However it really started, Lee and Kirby came up with the Fantastic Four — a team of space adventurers consisting of a brother, a sister, a genius (who would later marry the sister), and a brawler from the wrong side of the tracks — who each obtain different powers after a mysterious voyage. Reed Richards, the genius, gained the ability to stretch his body. Sue Storm gained invisibility and the power to construct force fields. Johnny Storm, Sue's brash, hard-headed brother, turned into the Human Torch. And poor Ben Grimm became the stone powerhouse known as the Thing.</p> \n<p>And thousands of<a href=""http://marvel.com/comics/issue/12894/fantastic_four_1961_1""> <i>Fantastic Four</i> No. 1 </a>issues were sold:</p> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""3944098"">\n<img src=""https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3944098/Screen_Shot_2015-02-17_at_2.07.44_PM.0.png""> \n<div class=""caption""> \n<p>(Marvel)</p> \n</div> \n</div> \n<p>Kirby's art and cover were revolutionary at the time. The cover looks unfinished — the sky isn't colored, and the building just disappears. The Four aren't wearing uniforms or superhero costumes the way Superman or Wonder Woman do. You have that orange Golem in the bottom left corner who doesn't even look human and a hairy fireball scorching through the sky. And that dude in the ropes just looks crazy weird, like something closer to a 7-year-old's doodle.</p> \n<p>Kirby's art was a more modern, novel take on the superhero story. There is no handholding, no explanation. The story is just as abrupt. The heroes bicker. They fight. They're jerks to one another:</p> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""3945294"">\n<img src=""https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3945294/Screen%20Shot%202015-08-05%20at%2010.10.46%20PM.png""> \n<div class=""caption""> \n<p><i>Fantastic Four</i> No. 1. (Marvel)</p> \n</div> \n</div> \n<p>This fighting and discord is in the basic fabric of superhero stories you see today. From the <em>Avengers</em> films to <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2015381/""><em>Guardians of the Galaxy</em></a><em> </em> to the upcoming<em> </em><a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/7/11/8933939/batman-vs-superman-dawn-of-justice-comic-con-trailer""><em>Batman v Superman</em></a>, the idea that good guys don't always have the same idea of what's good — and don't always get along — has become integral to team stories. But at the time, Kirby and Lee's Fantastic Four were the team that really embodied this idea.</p> \n<h3>Is being a superhero a curse?</h3> \n<p>The initial thrust of the Fantastic Four stories was their reflection of the era's obsession with space. Sue and Johnny Storm, Reed Richards, and Ben Grimm were sold as space adventurers who were altered when something went wrong and they were doused with cosmic rays in the vast beyond. <i>Fantastic Four</i> No. 1 was published in 1961 and went to market in August, four months after the Russians sent <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuri_Gagarin"">the first human</a> into space.</p> \n<p>When you talk to comic book writers, artists, and historians, they will say that large political events tend to shape the superhero stories for years to come. The atom bomb gave us more superheroes (see:<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_Atom""> Captain Atom</a>), which then begat reactions to superheroes like Alan Moore's dark and nihilistic <a href=""http://www.dccomics.com/characters/watchmen"">Watchmen</a>. The Cold War brought about a glut of communist Russian characters (mostly villains). And the pain and <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/5/19/8577803/avengers-age-of-ultron-review-politics"">tragedy of 9/11 still shapes stories today</a>.</p> \n<p>When it came to the Fantastic Four, people were still unsure what space could bring. It could be a place of wonderment and give these people fantastic (ha) powers. But it could also bring pain, which is how these characters first felt when they found themselves transformed. When they started getting abilities, Johnny Storm called his friends monsters:</p> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""3945170"">\n<img src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3945170/Screen%20Shot%202015-08-05%20at%208.39.29%20PM.png""> \n<div class=""caption""> \n<p>Johnny Storm is not happy about these powers. (<i>Fantastic Four</i> No. 1/Marvel)</p> \n</div> \n</div> \n<p>Kirby and Lee wanted to play with the idea that being a superhero could be a curse or make you a freak — something we didn't see with DC's Justice League. The way these powers would affect these heroes' lives would be fleshed out in later issues (the F4 decide pretty quickly to become heroes), but Kirby and Lee laid the groundwork for a comic book that really did explore the psychological toll of heroism.</p> \n<h3>The Thing is a story we can empathize with</h3> \n<p>Toward the end of junior high, when I was teetering on the brink of high school, I found myself working <i>Fantastic Four</i> comic books into my regular diet of several <i>X-Men</i> titles. I liked the X-Men (Storm mostly) because they felt as though they were cutting against the grain of comic books at the time. They felt like a family coping with a world that didn't understand them. And as I look back to the <i>Fantastic Four</i> issues I read, I'm beginning to understand I liked them for the same reason.</p> \n<p>What I don't think I grasped at the time was how the Fantastic Four were a canny commentary on celebrity culture. The F4 did not need alter egos or secret identities. They lived their lives publicly as revered heroes. But three of the four (Johnny, Reed, Sue) did not have their looks affected by the accident. Ben Grimm is another story — a painful one.</p> \n<p>Grimm's appearance as a monster was a constant source of insecurity for the hero. People treated him differently. And when they weren't scared of him, they pitied him. This came to a boil in <a href=""http://marvel.com/comics/issue/13257/fantastic_four_1961_51""><i>Fantastic Four</i> No. 51</a>, titled ""This Man … This Monster"":</p> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""3945264"">\n<img src=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3945264/Screen%20Shot%202015-08-05%20at%209.35.49%20PM.png""> \n<div class=""caption""> \n<p><i>Fantastic Four</i> No. 51. (Marvel)</p> \n</div> \n</div> \n<p>In that plot, written by Lee and drawn by Kirby, Grimm deals with his physical appearance and the way it's affected his psyche. There's also a stark contrast to Johnny Storm, who is basically Zac Efron reimagined as a superhero:</p> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""3945268"">\n<img src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3945268/Screen%20Shot%202015-08-05%20at%2010.45.20%20AM.png""> \n<div class=""caption""> \n<p><i>Fantastic Four</i> No. 51. (Marvel)</p> \n</div> \n</div> \n<p>In this issue, a villain steals Grimm's powers and appearance, giving him the chance to live a normal life, which he does for a few moments. But his closest friends (Reed Richards and Sue) don't trust Grimm in his human form and only trust the guy that looks like the Thing. This allows the villain to infiltrate the inner sanctum of the F4.</p> \n<p>""This Monster…"" might not be the most elegant comic ever written, but it's soulful in a way that comics often aren't.</p> \n<p>The Thing hits the nerves and conjures up the inevitable anxiety that all teens feel at some point in their lives. But Grimm's story also parallels the frustration of being a minority in America and the uneasiness of wanting to belong. The three other members have the ability to pass as ""normal."" Grimm doesn't. He's constantly defined by the way he looks and has to learn how to live with it.</p> \n<p>It's tragic, it's sad, but it's also one of the most thoughtful and human aspects of the comic.</p> \n<h3>Marvel sold the rights to the Fantastic Four. That killed them.</h3> \n<p>The terribleness that is the two Jessica Alba and Chris Evans–led <em>Fantastic Four</em> movies (in <a href=""https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=8&amp;ved=0CDUQFjAHahUKEwiCsanYmJfHAhUBcT4KHaJFAhA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.imdb.com%2Ftitle%2Ftt0120667%2F&amp;ei=HsLEVYKqMIHi-QGii4mAAQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNEW2FQdLqUYRVn-K5aqSMDfUQvrJw&amp;bvm=bv.99804247,d.cWw"">2005</a> and <a href=""https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=11&amp;ved=0CEwQFjAKahUKEwiCsanYmJfHAhUBcT4KHaJFAhA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.imdb.com%2Ftitle%2Ftt0486576%2F&amp;ei=HsLEVYKqMIHi-QGii4mAAQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNGIiZEvnxMDxjqzx_ZoXtXxCavbRA&amp;bvm=bv.99804247,d.cWw"">2007</a>), and <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/8/7/9114501/fantastic-four-movie-review"">this current monstrosity</a>, has become synonymous with the superhero team. What gets lost is that there was a point that the <i>Fantastic Four</i> comic book was actually more popular than <i>The Avengers</i>. And even when the team's popularity waned, it wasn't too far behind:</p> \n<div id=""how_the_xmen_dominated_the_avengers_in_comic_book_sales_in_the_90s""></div> \n<p> \n<script type=""text/javascript""><!-- \nwindow.pym || document.write( '<scr' + 'ipt src=""http://apps.voxmedia.com/tools/javascripts/vendor/pym-cb3d02c4.js""></scr' + 'ipt>' ); \n// --></script> \n<script type=""text/javascript""><!-- \nvar how_the_xmen_dominated_the_avengers_in_comic_book_sales_in_the_90s = new pym.Parent( ""how_the_xmen_dominated_the_avengers_in_comic_book_sales_in_the_90s"", ""http://apps.voxmedia.com/tools/charts-public/?labels=Jan%2097%2CJan%2098%2CJan%2099%2CJan%2000%2CJan%2001&datasets=196041%2C148639%2C136483%2C109676%2C100964%7C185204%2C154639%2C139010%2C113703%2C98437%7C152651%2C121664%2C76896%2C58575%2C51595%7C113922%2C138884%2C93836%2C76535%2C67599&title=How%20the%20X-Men%20dominated%20the%20Avengers%20in%20comic%20book%20sales%20in%20the%20'90s.&description=These%20are%20the%20preorder%20figures%20by%20North%20American%20comic%20book%20shops%20of%20different%20Marvel%20titles%20in%20the%20'90s.&source=Comichron%2FDiamond%20Comic%20Distributors&link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.comichron.com%2Fmonthlycomicssales%2F&type=bar&legend=X-men%2CUncanny%20X-Men%20%2CFantastic%20Four%2CAvengers"", { xdomain: "".*.voxmedia.com"" } ); \n// --></script> \n</p> \n<p> </p> \n<p>In <i>Avengers</i> No. 1, the comic book that brings the Avengers together for the first time, the Fantastic Four have a splendid cameo.

(Marvel)</p> \n</div> \n</div> \n<p>At their height, the F4 were telling scrubs like the Avengers to deal with the trivial stuff. Fast forward 50 years or so, and we're at a point when Marvel announced this April that Fantastic Four's <a href=""http://deadline.com/2014/10/fantastic-four-comics-cancelled-2015-movie-850498/"">main comic book had been canceled</a> and that the F4 are basically non-factors in the Marvel comic book universe.</p> \n<p>To critics and comic fans, the main reason for their disappearance was the team's film rights. Back in 1990s, when the comic book bubble burst, Marvel was flailing — the company filed for bankruptcy in 1996. As comic book movies weren't giant hits back then, Marvel sold its rights to popular characters as a way to make cash it wasn't making off the comic books themselves.</p> \n<p>""The company made a series of licensing deals around the time they sought bankruptcy protection in 1996,"" <a href=""http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304677904579535632100885654"">the Wall Street Journal</a>'s Ben Fritz explained. ""These deals put Spider-Man in the hands of Sony. The X-Men and Fantastic Four went to Fox. Because the studios were in strong positions, they agreed to share only about 5% of the revenue from each film with Marvel.""</p> \n<p>Though Marvel hasn't said why the F4 have been diminished, making them big players in the Marvel Universe makes no business sense anymore. Simply put: Investing in properties like the X-Men or Fantastic Four isn't in Marvel's best financial interest. Fox would and could ostensibly make movies out of that great stuff, and then Marvel would only get a tiny cut of the revenue. And though the X-Men were in the same Fox boat as the Fantastic Four, they were the ultimate comic book of the '90s, making it impossible for Marvel to shelve them.</p> \n<p>""They're [The Fantastic Four] an easy target in the war between Fox and Marvel,"" <a href=""http://www.vulture.com/2014/10/fantastic-four-comics-canceled-marvel.html"">Vulture's Abraham Riesman wrote</a>.</p> \n<p>Having terrible <i>Fantastic Four</i> movies doesn't exactly help the cause, either.</p> \n<p>The rub is that a lot of things we love about superhero movies and what makes them so great come from the Fantastic Four. While the '60s idea of space travel looks dated, the comic books' main stories about these heroes are still fresh — so fresh that we still see them in stories today. The feelings of family, the questioning of how ""good"" guys are supposed to act, the idea of a hero being a monster — these are all stories and themes we saw in the first issue of <em>The Fantastic Four</em> in 1961 and are also the same major themes in this summer's <i><a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/4/30/8519829/avengers-age-of-ultron-review"">Avengers: Age of Ultron</a> </i>movie.</p> \n<p>The Fantastic Four's relevance is the saddest thing about them. Seeing something dated and shopworn dissolve into nothing doesn't hurt because some part of you thinks it deserves that. But there's still a lot of life left in the Fantastic Four's bones — so much that even in the face of the unmitigated disaster that is Fox's new movie, I still believe in the Fantastic Four and the possibility of not just another great movie, but another great story. There's a comeback to be written, but I don't know if we'll ever see it.</p>",Movies

"The Fox News rules for how to treat women, in one infuriating video",http://www.vox.com/2015/8/24/9198221/fox-news-sexism,Want to seem impressive and powerful? Demean your female colleagues in public.,"<p><iframe width=""1280"" height=""720"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/DEoWSaM61NI"" frameborder=""0""></iframe></p> \n<p>If your only source of information were Fox News, what would it teach you about women? If this supercut from the liberal-leaning watchdog group Media Matters for America is anything to go by, nothing good. In this six-minute video, Fox hosts and guests repeatedly belittle, insult, harass, and objectify women — including women Fox anchors themselves.</p> \n<p>To be sure, no one actually relies on Fox as their sole source of information about the world. But for many Americans, Fox is their most trusted source of news, which means the attitudes Fox espouses do inform — or at least reinforce — their worldview. The same goes for any kind of trusted or beloved media: We can’t help but absorb the attitude along with the substance. (My steady diet of <i>X-Men</i> movies and <i>Buffy</i> episodes during adolescence is probably responsible for my belief that women can read minds, control the weather, and fight vampires.)</p> \n<!--  ########  BEGIN SNIPPET  ########  --> \n \n<div data-analytics-category=""article"" data-analytics-action=""link:related"" class=""chorus-snippet s-related""> \n  <span class=""s-related__title"">Related</span> \n<a href=""http://www.vox.com/xpress/2014/9/25/6844297/fox-news-commentator-calls-female-pilot-leading-isis-air-strike-boobs"" target=""new""> On Fox News, male soldiers get respect, but a female pilot is “boobs on the ground”</a> \n  <!-- End links --> \n</div> \n \n<!--  ########  END SNIPPET  ########  --> \n \n<p></p> \n \n<p>As it turns out, watching the supercut is pretty informative. I'd seen a lot of the individual incidents before, and even <a href=""http://www.vox.com/xpress/2014/9/25/6844297/fox-news-commentator-calls-female-pilot-leading-isis-air-strike-boobs"">written about one of them</a>. But while each comment can seem like a special sexism snowflake in isolation, when put together like this, certain patterns start to emerge. It's as if Fox's male hosts and guests are given a short list of rules when they enter the studio: How to Exploit Traditional Gender Norms for Fun and Profit.</p> \n<p>So what exactly is Fox teaching its viewers about women?</p> \n<h3>Empowerment for women hurts men, so men must remain constantly on guard against women's equality</h3> \n<p>Perhaps the most surprising thing about watching the supercut is the sheer testosterone-laden insecurity of it all. Fox's male anchors and guests frequently expressed a belief that women's rights were a zero-sum game: that any progress or empowerment for women must come at the expense of men.</p> \n<p>This idea was stated explicitly — it wasn't subtext. One guest announced that ""men are depressed and it’s their own fault, because men are allowing women to take over the world."" Another segment asked whether Disney's animated movie <i>Frozen</i> was ""empowering women by turning men into fools."" In other words, because that movie features sisters who save each other, and their kingdom, from peril instead of relying on a prince to ride to the rescue, that must necessarily be hurting men.</p> \n<p>And other segments referred to the rise of female breadwinners as ""troubling"" and a ""recipe for disharmony within the home."" The sentiment that a woman ought to ""know your place and shut your mouth"" was so pervasive throughout the video that I found myself almost charmed when one guest tried to insist that women didn't want to work anyway, and would be happier staying home with a husband and children. Misguided as that sentiment is, it at least takes women's happiness into account. The rest of the comments treated women's happiness as a threat against which men needed to remain vigilant.</p> \n<h3>Making women uncomfortable is a great way for men to show how impressive they are</h3> \n<p>Being vigilant against women becoming too empowered or happy was apparently a rule that extended into the Fox News studios themselves. Crude comments and sexism weren't reserved as a way to scoff at liberal women or politicians like Nancy Pelosi and Hillary Clinton — they were directed at Fox's own female hosts and guests.</p> \n<p>In clip after clip, the women of Fox News are shown cringing with discomfort as their male colleagues speak to them with crude or overly sexualized language. Bill O'Reilly asked a female commentator to provide video of herself ""actually sweating."" Another male host casually introduced a segment by calling it ""the only thing hotter than Brenda's outfit today."" Another, when asked by his female colleague to answer a question, sniggered, ""I like your top.""</p> \n<p>Watching those interactions strung together in a supercut makes it especially clear that these interactions aren't just a matter of one awkward or rude comment. They're a way for men to assert dominance over the women who share the screen with them — to show that the women they're speaking to aren't important enough to be treated with respect, and to put them in their place with crudely sexualized comments.</p> \n<p>It's not kind or polite to publicly ask a colleague what she does when she's ""making love"" to her boyfriend, as a male guest did to Fox Five's outraged Andrea Tantaros. It's simply disrespectful to demand video footage of a coworker's sweaty body, as O'Reilly did. And as the video makes clear, those incidents weren't outliers. The fact that the men of Fox News made such comments, over and over, sends a clear message that it's hilarious for men to publicly disrespect the women they work with.</p> \n<h3>Do not take a woman seriously if she is attractive. Do not take her seriously if she is unattractive, either.</h3> \n<p>This rule's so basic that I would almost have been disappointed if it didn't make Fox's playbook. Over and over, Fox segments hammered home the idea that the most important thing about a woman is whether she is sexually attractive to men.</p> \n<p>So, for instance, a story about the United Arab Emirates' first woman fighter pilot was an occasion for <i>Fox Five</i>'s male hosts to leeringly ask whether she was ""boobs on the ground,"" and to wonder aloud about ""taking down her missile defense system."" Tucker Carlson insisted that no one would have supported Texas state Sen. Wendy Davis's filibuster to protect reproductive rights if she hadn't been ""a handsome woman."" Rush Limbaugh guffawed that he loved the women's movement, ""especially when walking behind it.""</p> \n<p>Under that rulebook, women who aren't attractive aren't really even women at all. One host joked that Philip Seymour Hoffman should play Hillary Clinton in a movie, and another joked that Supreme Court justice Elena Kagan had to deny rumors that she had a penis.</p> \n<p>But either way, the lesson is clear: Women's actual accomplishments don't matter. The really important thing is whether they're attractive to men.</p> \n<h3>Women are irresponsible and scatterbrained and need men to look after them</h3> \n<p>According to the Fox News rules, it's fine for men to be in charge because women are simply too scatterbrained to be trusted with responsibility.</p> \n<p>That sentiment was spelled out by none other than Rupert Murdoch, who said that no one cares about small charges on a credit card because they're worried about ""their wives' hundred dollars."" Another gentleman assumed that women's financial irresponsibility was such a given that he used it as a metaphor for the financial health of the country as a whole: ""It’s like a wife and her credit cards,"" he explained. ""America has to be the husband that takes the credit card and breaks it up."" Another informed a shocked woman host that ""you women"" are ""just more prone to be scatterbrained. You’re just all over the place.""</p> \n<p>Got that? We poor women simply can't be trusted to make good decisions. That's why we need men to make decisions for us. Like, say, Vice co-founder Gavin McInnes, who casually announced that women ""are happier at home,"" and then informed Fox analyst and attorney Tamara Holder that she was deluding herself about the nature of her own ambitions. ""You're making a mistake,"" he explained to a flabbergasted Holder. ""You'd be much happier at home with a husband and children.""</p> \n<h3>No pants allowed</h3> \n<p>There was one last Fox News practice that I genuinely didn't see coming: no pants.</p> \n<p>Apparently <i>Fox &amp; Friends</i> didn't allow women to wear trousers, but when Gretchen Carlson left that program and got her own show, she earned more control over her wardrobe.  In the supercut's final clip, Carlson stands and gleefully shows off the pair of slacks she is wearing, announcing, ""I have on pants!""</p> \n<p>I guess on Fox that's what progress looks like.</p> \n<hr> \n<h3>VIDEO: An instance of mass media impacting popular belief</h3> \n<!--  ########  BEGIN VOLUME VIDEO  ########  --> \n<div class=""volume-video"" id=""volume-placement-9350"" data-volume-placement=""article"" data-analytics-placement=""entry:middle"" data-volume-id=""1808"" data-volume-uuid=""01af7dbe4"" data-analytics-label=""How pink became a girly color | 1808"" data-analytics-action=""volume:view:entry:middle"" data-analytics-viewport=""video""></div> \n<!--  ########  END VOLUME VIDEO  ########  -->",Movies

The show constantly teased these new beings, and tonight's season premiere feels like a definitive pulling of the trigger. The first five minutes of ""Laws of Nature""<strong> </strong>are a kinetic display of special effects and amazing powers as we follow a man who can't control his newfound ability to melt solid matter.</p> \n<p><iframe frameborder=""0"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/GlQu03jNhk0"" height=""315"" width=""560""></iframe></p> \n<p>But the premiere of <a href=""http://abc.go.com/shows/marvels-agents-of-shield/news/fan-hq/12102014-goodbye-trip-bj-britt?linkId=11138607""><em>Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.</em></a><em> </em>is just the tip of a complex, 50-year-old iceberg that began with the legendary Jack Kirby and Stan Lee. The two created some of the weirdest characters seen in comics, and delved into science fiction, caste systems, and the peculiar insanity of a race of people playing with eugenics. Today, the Inhumans have the potential to tell some of Marvel's most complex stories, and represent something far weirder and more interesting than what <a href=""http://abc.go.com/shows/marvels-agents-of-shield/news/fan-hq/12102014-goodbye-trip-bj-britt?linkId=11138607""><em>Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.</em></a><em> </em>has shown (so far).</p> \n<h3>What is an Inhuman?</h3> \n<p>The Inhumans are a race of superpowered beings that were created when an alien race called the Kree experimented on Earth's early, primitive humans. (Ronan the Accuser, the main villain in <em>Guardians of the Galaxy</em>, is a Kree.) Their official first appearance was in Marvel's <a href=""http://marvel.com/comics/issue/13249/fantastic_four_1961_44""><em>Fantastic Four</em></a><a href=""http://marvel.com/comics/issue/13249/fantastic_four_1961_44""> Nos. 44 through 46</a> (Medusa, a member of the Inhumans, had appeared earlier but did not identify as Inhuman), and they were created by comics artist Jack Kirby and Stan Lee:</p> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""4103766"">\n<img src=""https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4103766/Screen%20Shot%202015-09-28%20at%2012.23.42%20PM.png""> \n<div class=""caption""> \n<p><i>Fantastic Four</i> No. 45. (Marvel)</p> \n</div> \n</div> \n<p>The Fantastic Four at the time were Marvel's premier superhero team. What made them so popular wasn't just their superpowers, but rather the <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/8/7/9116015/fantastic-four-comic-explained"">family dynamic among the members</a> — they bickered, they fought, they weren't always as earnest or virtuous as superheroes could be.</p> \n<p>The<a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/8/7/9116015/fantastic-four-comic-explained""> Fantastic Four also capitalized on the Thing</a> (a.k.a. Ben Grimm) and his heartbreaking heroism. At the time, the Fantastic Four were seen as a counter to the Justice League — a group of handsome, mostly white superheroes who looked like humans (even though Superman is an alien and Wonder Woman is an Amazon). Grimm looked like a monster but had the heart of a hero.</p> \n<p>Kirby and Lee took both these elements and injected them into the Inhumans. In that first appearance, there's a pronounced effort to make the Inhumans a really weird-looking mess of a family:</p> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""4103942"">\n<img src=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4103942/Screen%20Shot%202015-09-28%20at%2012.32.40%20PM.png""> \n<div class=""caption""> \n<p><i>Fantastic Four </i>No. 45. (Marvel)</p> \n</div> \n</div> \n<p>Their strangeness would be amplified as different artists took on the team. The man in the picture above is named Gorgon, and though you can't tell in this issue, he has powerful hooves where his feet should be. Triton looks like a purple sphincter, and there's something not quite right about Medusa (the redhead).</p> \n<p>These weird appearances are tied into the bigger Inhuman origin story. The story, told in <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://marvel.com/comics/issue/11474/thor_1966_146""><i>Thor</i> Nos. 146</a> to 149, starts with the idea that Inhumans are actually humans who have undergone Kree experimentation, which speeds up their evolution and advancement.</p> \n<p>As part of this advancement, the Inhumans eventually figure out that exposing themselves to a substance called Terrigen Mist can grant them powers. After being in contact with this substance, they gain new abilities. Radnac, a monarch, explains how the mist could save the world but also could be a deadly plague:</p> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""4104546"">\n<img src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4104546/Screen%20Shot%202015-09-28%20at%203.33.52%20PM.png""> \n<div class=""caption""> \n<p><i>Thor</i> No. 146. (Marvel)</p> \n</div> \n</div> \n<p>The risk Radnac is talking about comes to fruition as many Inhumans develop deformities when they're exposed to the mist. But those deformities are often the source of their powers (see: Gorgon's hooves and Medusa's hair). The Inhuman origin story is a story about beginnings, but also an inspection of eugenics (<a href=""http://reformjudaismmag.net/03fall/comics.shtml"">Lee</a> and <a href=""http://archive.desmoinesregister.com/article/20120922/LIFE/309220016/How-Jewish-experience-shaped-our-superheroes"">Kirby</a> were of Jewish descent, and no strangers to the idea of eugenics in World War II), and of mitigating the damage of these experiments and creating the most powerful Inhumans possible. It's a both cynical and wondrous look at science and the political fallout of WWII,  as well as a deeper foray into science fiction for Kirby and Lee.</p> \n<p>Inhumans are, in a sense, like the mutants who would go on to become X-Men, in that all Inhumans have a common origin story or a common link that makes them Inhuman. The most notable Inhumans are the Inhuman Royal Family (more on them in a bit), who have their own strange dynamic, which includes an evil brother named Maximus the Mad. While the Inhumans are their own race and have their own story, you can see how Kirby, Lee, and Marvel tried to re-create some of the Fantastic Four magic.</p> \n<h3>Who are the Inhumans?</h3> \n<p>There's a gulf of difference between the Inhumans' lush comic book universe and the Inhumans that appear in Marvel's<em> Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D</em>.<em> </em>Of course, the comics have some 50 years of source material on the TV show.</p> \n<p>But the Inhumans never really played a major role in Marvel's comic books the way teams like the X-Men or the Fantastic Four did. Until recently, the Inhumans were a bit like a satellite crew. They would chime in during major arcs, but never commanded (and to this day, still don't) a major following.</p> \n<p>The main characters of the comic books are a group of beings known as the Inhuman Royal Family. They're the family in that first appearance, and are built like a traditional super team, with members possessing powers like super strength, the command over nature, and mind control.</p> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""4105050"">\n<img src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4105050/52333bd91a4ac%20(2).jpg""> \n<div class=""caption""> \n<p>From left: Triton, Gorgon, Karnak, Black Bolt, Medusa, and Crystal. (Marvel)</p> \n</div> \n</div> \n<ul> \n<li> <strong>Black Bolt</strong> is the king. He emits large amounts of energy and force through his voice. If he's not careful, he can level cities by speaking. In order to get around his power, he has developed a telepathic bond with his wife.</li> \n<li> <strong>Medusa</strong> is queen of the Inhumans. Medusa's power is in her enhanced hair (unsurprisingly), which she can mentally command to do anything she wishes, like lift heavy objects, protect her from harm, whip her enemies, or subdue them.</li> \n<li> <strong>Crystal</strong> is Medusa's younger sister. She has the power to manipulate the four elements — earth, air, fire, and water — and mix them together if she wishes.</li> \n<li> <strong>Gorgon</strong> is Black Bolt's cousin. He's the muscle of the Royal Family and has bull's legs, a mutation caused by the mists. He creates earthquakes by stomping.</li> \n<li> <strong>Karnak</strong> is a freaky little dude with face tattoos who's also one of Black Bolt's cousins. He has the power to find a weak point in any object, plan, or person. Do not mess with Karnak.</li> \n<li> <strong>Triton</strong> is still another of Black Bolt's cousins. He's green. He looks like a fish and can breathe underwater. He also has super strength.</li> \n<li> <strong>Maximus</strong> the Mad. Black Bolt's brother, he's basically the Loki of the Inhumans. You shouldn't trust him, as he's always looking out for his best interests. He has mind-control powers.</li> \n<li> <strong>Lockjaw</strong> is an alien bulldog and the royal pet of the Inhumans. He has the power of teleportation.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>On<em> S.H.I.E.L.D.</em><em>,</em> the Inhuman storyline is massively different. During last season's winter finale, a member of the team, Skye, was exposed to a Terrigen Crystal and developed powers that allow her to control earthquakes. The character existed, with a different name, in comic books before the television series (Quake was created in 2004), but it wasn't until after this development that a comic book (<em><a href=""http://marvel.com/comics/issue/52430/shield_2014_7"">S.H.I.E.L.D.</a></em> No. 7) explained/retconned that she is Inhuman:</p> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""4104674"">\n<img src=""https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4104674/Screen%20Shot%202015-09-28%20at%203.57.58%20PM.png""> \n<div class=""caption""> \n<p><i>S.H.I.E.L.D</i>. No. 7. (Marvel)</p> \n</div> \n</div> \n<p><em>S.H.I.E.L.D. </em>is now teasing the creation of more Inhumans this season, as the traces of crystals have begun altering latent Inhumans into beings with powers.</p> \n<p>What's interesting is that we're now seeing Marvel try to repackage or rewrite the Inhumans into something that will hook audiences. <em>S.H.I.E.L.D.</em>, like Marvel's movies, is geared more toward a casual audience, and that audience might not appreciate the complex backstory of a caste system, a royal family, and a freaky little man named Karnak.</p> \n<p>I'm not sure the comics-reading audience even appreciates them. The Inhumans were some of the last characters Kirby introduced before he left the company for DC Comics in 1970. They were finally given their own book in 1975, which ended in 1977. They appeared in limited series in 1998, 2000, 2003, and again in <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silent_War"">2007</a>.</p> \n<p>The Inhumans haven't had the longevity or loyal fan base that characters like the X-Men, the Avengers, or DC's Justice League enjoyed. And the <em>Inhuman</em> comic book — which debuted in April to decent sales <a href=""http://www.comichron.com/monthlycomicssales/2014/2014-04.html"">and cracked the top 20</a> of comics sold in North America — saw a<a href=""http://www.comicsbeat.com/marvel-month-to-month-sales-charts-october-2014-variations-on-variant-themes/""> 48 percent drop by its October issue</a>.</p> \n<h3>What's the best Inhumans story out there right now?</h3> \n<p>The most critically acclaimed Inhumans story in comics right now isn't about the Inhuman Royal Family, but rather the story of<a href=""http://read.marvel.com/#/book/32979""> Ms. Marvel, a.k.a. Kamala Khan</a>, a 16-year-old Pakistani-American girl who is a latent Inhuman. After being exposed to the Terrigen Mists, she finds herself with shape-shifting powers. But it's more than just the powers that define Kamala's journey: <em>Ms. Marvel</em> also explores questions of identity, family, race, religion, and assimilation in modern-day America — five decades after we first saw many of the same ideas in the Fantastic Four (and yes, the Inhumans):</p> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""4104772"">\n<img src=""https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4104772/Screen%20Shot%202015-09-28%20at%204.22.06%20PM.png""> \n<div class=""caption""> \n<p><i>Ms. Marvel</i> No. 1. (Marvel)</p> \n</div> \n</div> \n<p>Written by G. Willow Wilson and drawn by Adrian Alphona, Kamala's story evokes this generation's Peter Parker. It's fresh and honest. The art carries the same kind of emotions that Hayao Miyazaki films do. And there's an effortless joy in the comic's bones and in Kamala's spirit.</p> \n<p>Audiences have clearly responded: <a href=""http://www.bleedingcool.com/2014/10/15/ms-marvel-1-goes-to-seventh-printing-batgirl-35-gets-a-second/"">Last October</a>, <em>Ms. Marvel N</em>o. 1 went into a seventh reprinting — a rare marker of success in comic books.</p> \n<h3>Why do the Inhumans matter?</h3> \n<p>This is sort of complicated, but it starts with the idea that Marvel has invested a lot into the Inhumans and ends with the potential reasons for why it's poured so much into the franchise.</p> \n<p>In 2013, Marvel introduced a major comic book crossover event called <a href=""http://marvel.wikia.com/Infinity_(Event)"">""Infinity,""</a> where Black Bolt detonated a Terrigen Mist bomb and spread the substance all over Earth, creating countless numbers of Inhumans. (There's a similar storyline going on in <em>Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.</em>'s third season.) This increases the potential for different kinds of characters (they are sometimes called Nuhumans) and new storylines.</p> \n<p>The fallout over the Infinity arc, dubbed ""Inhumanity,"" sees the Inhuman Royal Family beginning to live on Earth after their homeland, Attilan, is destroyed. This increases their interactions with the Avengers and events on Earth. All of this means that the Inhumans are no longer a satellite team, and have played major roles in Marvel's subsequent crossovers like ""Axis"" and ""Secret Wars.""</p> \n<p>The Inhumans' higher profile in the comic books, combined with their pronounced television presence on this season on <em>Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,</em><em> </em>indicates that Marvel is gearing up for the <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4154858/"">2019 </a><em><a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4154858/"">Inhumans</a></em><a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4154858/""> movie</a>. By then, if this all works out, the Inhumans will be a more recognizable team. A cameo or two in the 2017 <em>Guardians</em> sequel could also help lay the foundation for something bigger for the Inhumans and further build out Marvel's cosmic universe.</p> \n<p>Additionally, Marvel saw an epic <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/8/6/5967101/what-guardians-of-the-galaxys-massive-success-means-for-marvel"">rise in sales</a> of <em>Guardians of the Galaxy</em> comics when it confirmed it was working on a movie, and it probably wouldn't mind seeing a similar boost for the <em>Inhumans</em>' comics.</p> \n<p>But then there's the question of why Marvel invested in the first place.</p> \n<h3>Marvel's Inhumans and ""kill the X-Men"" conspiracy plot, explained</h3> \n<p>For the past few years, there's been a looming conspiracy that Marvel is <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/8/11/5974743/marvels-x-men-conspiracy-theory-guardians-future"">downplaying the X-Men</a> because of their film rights agreement with Fox. The theory goes: Marvel doesn't own the X-Men's films, and therefore isn't as interested in investing resources as it would be for other books whose film rights it does own. You can get lost in forums and threads where this theory is discussed, rehashed, and sliced up several different ways, but Marvel has never officially said anything about it.</p> \n<p>So here's where the Inhumans come in. The Inhumans are very similar to the mutants — they're feared, they're considered weird, they have superpowers that don't come from magic or computers — and they could, if Marvel wanted, be a way to write mutant stories without actually giving Fox source material. They're also, according to some critics, benefiting from the ground the X-Men broke.</p> \n<p>""Building up the Inhumans theoretically allows Marvel to retain the value of mutants without paying Fox a tithe. The Inhumans are mutant sucralose,"" <a href=""http://comicsalliance.com/super-inhumans-vs-mutants/"">Andrew Wheeler at Comics Alliance wrote</a>. ""The Inhumans are new neighbors, flush with capital, edging out the unwanted residents that built this community, and eroding the vibrant culture that made that neighborhood so special.""</p> \n<p>Because of the X-Men's popularity and the Inhumans' lack thereof (the ones not named Kamala Khan, anyway), it's hard to fathom a world where someone would freeze out the X-Men. The numbers simply aren't there. But that doesn't change the fact that it would be in Marvel's best interest to keep trying different ways to get people excited about the Inhumans.</p> \n<h3>So what's next?</h3> \n<p>The Inhumans won't be getting a movie until 2019, and no one knows what direction that film will go in. For now, the Inhuman stories being told on television are wildly different from the ones that are being and have been told in comics, with the television storylines being more popular. If things remain the same, and this third season of <em>Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.</em> is popular while interest in the dramas surrounding the Inhuman Royal Family remain lukewarm, it wouldn't be surprising if Marvel incorporated elements that are more in line with the television show. It did, after all, ignore the comic book origins to bring us the Avengers Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch.</p> \n<p><i>The third season of </i>Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.<i> premieres Tuesday at 9 pm on ABC.</i></p>",Movies

These new characters, of course, present the potential for new superheroes with amazing abilities.</p> \n<p>As viewers found out, the Inhuman event also presents the possibility of new villains ready to bring on the devastation. A new mysterious villain, looking like a cross between a porcupine, one of <em>Avatar</em>'s Na'vi, and a professional wrestler, made his debut.</p> \n<p>""Tell me where to find the Inhuman,"" were the only words of substance this villain muttered, before zapping a hole into a security guard's chest.

We don't even know his name <span>or the extent of his powers. That's understandable, since we are, after all, on the first episode of the third season.</span></p> \n<p>But Marvel comic books are a different matter.

Lash is very interested in these potential Inhumans:</p> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""4109010"">\n<img src=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4109010/Screen%20Shot%202015-09-29%20at%202.36.48%20PM.png""> \n<div class=""caption""> \n<p><i>Inhuman</i> No.1. (Marvel)</p> \n</div> \n</div> \n<p>What we find out later on is that Lash is actually from a hidden Inhuman city called Orollan and that he actually sees the Inhuman transformation (referred to as Terrigensis) as a privilege and a test.</p> \n<p>Surviving the transformation is hard enough. Humans who don't have enough Inhuman DNA die during the transformation process. But Lash sees Inhumans with certain powers as more valuable than others:</p> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""4109030"">\n<img src=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4109030/Screen%20Shot%202015-09-29%20at%206.12.55%20PM.png""> \n<div class=""caption""> \n<p><i>Inhuman</i> No. 3.

(Marvel)</p> \n</div> \n</div> \n<p>Lash is a zealot who has fully bought into this idea of worthiness. He belongs to a backward and cruel society, but he also represents the message that not every Inhuman gets along with every other Inhuman. Lash can, thus, be read as an allegory for humanity and the violence humans can and have inflicted on one another. The Inhumans, Lash's existence makes clear, are just like regular humans — they are not a united front or a monolithic race.</p> \n<h3>Lash's powers, explained</h3> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""4109700"">\n<img src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4109700/2015-09-29%2023_02_20.gif""> \n<div class=""caption""> \n<p>(Marvel/ABC)</p> \n</div> \n</div> \n<p>On the show and in the comic book, Lash wields a blue-tinted energy.

But we don't know how much of Lash's background the show will incorporate.</p> \n<p>A large part of Lash's motivation stems from this idea that he grew up in a society that was largely shunned by mainstream Inhuman civilization and the <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/9/29/9414429/marvel-inhumans-explained"">Inhuman Royal Family that rules it</a>. He grows up hating what those Inhumans represent and holds a deep hostility toward them. In fact, when push comes to shove, it's the Inhuman Queen Medusa who restrains and defeats him:</p> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""4109090"">\n<img src=""https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4109090/Screen%20Shot%202015-09-29%20at%206.46.48%20PM.png""> \n<div class=""caption""> \n<p>Medusa pwning Lash in <i>Inhuman</i> No. 3. (Marvel)</p> \n</div> \n</div> \n<p>Those characters and the setting of Lash's home of Orollan don't yet exist in the Marvel television universe. His appearance could spell a new world to explore, which could come to full fruition in Marvel's 2019 <em>Inhumans</em> movie. There's also a world of exciting and stunning visual effects that these characters bring with them.</p> \n<p>But it's unclear how much or how little of that <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/9/29/9414429/marvel-inhumans-explained"">Royal Family</a> and Lash's background Marvel wants to include. Lash could just be a powerful evil menace for a few episodes of the TV show. Whatever the case, we'll all be watching for him in the weeks to come.</p>",Movies
Kelly Sue DeConnick made Captain Marvel great. Now sheâ€™s ending her run.,http://www.vox.com/2015/10/3/9445659/deconnick-captain-marvel,Saying goodbye is hard to do.,"<p>I think of Kelly Sue DeConnick as the Buffy the Vampire Slayer of the comic book world. Every fan of the series has their own interpretation of what Buffy means to them, but to me, Buffy's defining quality was her ever-present desire to make everyone else as strong as she was (and her frustration when she couldn't).</p> \n<p>It made sense, then, that in the last episode of <em>Buffy The Vampire Slayer</em>, ""<a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0533407/"">Chosen</a>,"" Buffy would somewhat achieve her goal. With a spell from Willow, she changes the rules — each generation only has one slayer — that ""a bunch of men who died thousands of years ago"" created.</p> \n<p>""Are you ready to be strong?"" she asks her fellow Slayers, before launching into the final battle.</p> \n<p>Since <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/11/5/7138099/captain-marvel-background-history-movie"">taking over </a><em><a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/11/5/7138099/captain-marvel-background-history-movie"">Captain Marvel</a></em><a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/11/5/7138099/captain-marvel-background-history-movie""> in 2012</a>, DeConnick has been asking herself and her readers — the most fervent of which are known as the Carol Corps. — the same question. Captain Marvel, a.k.a. Carol Danvers, was an oft-overlooked powerhouse before DeConnick and artist Dexter Soy breathed new life into the character, making her more of a <em>Rocketeer</em>-ish space commander than a Space Vixen. DeConnick refocused her story on Danvers's Air Force background and made her one of the Avengers' most tactical minds.</p> \n<p>""Higher, further, faster, more,"" became the motto of DeConnick, Danvers, and the Carol Corps.</p> \n<p>Last week, three years after she began renewing Danvers's legacy, DeConnick said goodbye to the character. We knew this was coming. Back in <a href=""http://comicbook.com/2015/06/21/kelly-sue-deconnick-leaving-captain-marvel/"">June</a>, she announced she was leaving the book to focus on her other comics, like <em>Bitch Planet</em> and <em>Pretty Deadly,</em> as well as on Milkfed Criminal Masterminds, the television production company she runs with her husband. But knowing the end was coming didn't make<a href=""http://marvel.com/comics/issue/51576/captain_marvel_the_carol_corps_2015_4""> </a><em><a href=""http://marvel.com/comics/issue/51576/captain_marvel_the_carol_corps_2015_4"">Captain Marvel and the Carol Corps. </a>No. 4</em><em><a href=""http://marvel.com/comics/issue/51576/captain_marvel_the_carol_corps_2015_4""> </a></em>hurt any less.</p> \n<p>DeConnick, sharing co-writing duties with Kelly Thompson, takes readers into a final battle similar to Buffy's. Danvers and her Banshees, a team of female fighter pilots, have to take on a police force of Thors, each wielding his own mythical hammer. (The Thors are part of Marvel's epic <em>Secret Wars</em> crossover.) They're outgunned and outmatched. Their backs are pinned against the wall. The Thors know if they kill Carol, they kill the Banshees.</p> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""4119328"">\n<img src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4119328/Screen%20Shot%202015-10-02%20at%201.01.28%20PM.png""> \n<div class=""caption""> \n<p><em>Carol Corps.</em> No. 4. (Marvel)</p> \n</div> \n</div> \n<p>The art, by Laura Braga and  Paolo Pantalena, is shattering. The stakes are dramatic, and each page is filled with crackling action. Punches are thrown, hammers are wielded, shots are fired — the two have a way of translating all that motion onto the page without it feeling claustrophobic or cluttered. And all of the kinetic energy makes the book's slower-paced, suspenseful pivotal moments even more powerful.</p> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""4119714"">\n<img src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4119714/Screen%20Shot%202015-10-02%20at%202.53.09%20PM.png""> \n<div class=""caption""> \n<p><em>Carol Corps.</em> No. 4. (Marvel)</p> \n</div> \n</div> \n<p>But it really comes back to DeConnick and Thompson's <em>Buffy</em> moment. Danvers and her Banshees come face to face with the unknown. They're going higher, further, faster, and more than ever before. Carol and the Banshees hurtling toward the stars, and whatever awaits them (death is a significant possibility), calls back to the first arc of <em>Captain Marvel </em>and the idea that this search for greatness is a way of living your life in the face of fear.</p> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""4119924"">\n<img src=""https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4119924/Screen%20Shot%202015-10-02%20at%203.33.55%20PM.png""> \n<div class=""caption""> \n<p><em>Captain Marvel </em>No. 1. (Marvel)</p> \n</div> \n</div> \n<p>It's impossible not to see the ending of <em>Captain Marvel and the Carol Corps</em>. as a parallel to DeConnick's departure from Marvel. There's a realized sense of fear at the end of the comic book, something shared by DeConnick as she enters a new phase of her career, and Danvers as she takes her team into the unknown.</p> \n<p>Even if failure awaits both DeConnick and Danvers, they tried. They both made a choice to be strong, and shared that strength with others. That's how you end a run.</p>",Movies
Color film was built for white people.

The chemicals coating the film simply weren't adequate to capture a diversity of darker skin tones. And the photo labs established in the 1940s and 50s even used an image of a white woman, called a Shirley card, to calibrate the colors for printing:</p> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4073610/shirley.0.gif"" alt=""Shirley card"" data-chorus-asset-id=""4073610""></p> \n<p>Concordia University professor Lorna Roth has researched the evolution of skin tone imaging. She explained in a <a href=""http://www.cjc-online.ca/index.php/journal/article/view/2196/2055"" target=""_blank"">2009 paper</a> how the older technology distorted the appearance of black subjects:</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>Problems for the African-American community, for example, have included reproduction of facial images without details, lighting challenges, and ashen-looking facial skin colours contrasted strikingly with the whites of eyes and teeth.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>How this would affect non-white people seemingly didn't occur to those who designed and operated the photo systems. In an essay for <a href=""http://www.buzzfeed.com/syreetamcfadden/teaching-the-camera-to-see-my-skin#.tlyjmGGxJ3"" target=""_blank"">Buzzfeed</a>, writer and photographer Syreeta McFadden described growing up with film that couldn't record her actual appearance:</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>The inconsistencies were so glaring that for a while, I thought it was impossible to get a decent picture of me that captured my likeness. I began to retreat from situations involving group photos. And sure, many of us are fickle about what makes a good portrait. But it seemed the technology was stacked against me. I only knew, though I didn’t understand why, that the lighter you were, the more likely it was that the camera — the film — got your likeness right.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Many of the technological biases have since been corrected (though, not all of them, as explained in the video above). Still, we often see controversies about the misrepresentation of non-white subjects in magazines and advertisements.

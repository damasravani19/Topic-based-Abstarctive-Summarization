How NFL teams ignore basic economics and draft players irrationally,http://www.vox.com/2014/5/7/5683448/how-nfl-teams-ignore-basic-economics-and-draft-players-irrationally,The data clearly says teams should trade down and amass lower picks to diversify risk. But most general managers ignore this advice completely.,"<p>The NFL draft begins on Thursday. In the football world, it is a huge deal.</p> \n<p>For non-football fans: this <span>is when NFL teams select college football players to add to their rosters, the new players awkwardly hold up jerseys with the number one on them, and football fans everywhere freak out</span><span>. The worst teams are given the highest picks, and if they want to improve, they need to use them as shrewdly as possible.</span></p> \n<p>Teams that succeed — like the Seattle Seahawks, winners of this past season's Super Bowl — tend to <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.bostonglobe.com/sports/2014/05/01/which-nfl-teams-have-been-best-draft-lately/H5mBGyXErkXptvVPFzg9TM/story.html"">build their rosters heavily through the draft</a>, and merely supplement their drafted talent through trades and free agency. NFL executives invest huge amounts of time and resources into scouting players and ranking them, hoping to draft stars in the first round and solid contributors later on.</p> \n<p><q class=""right"" aria-hidden=""true"">it's not their imperfect player evaluation, but their refusal to follow the principle of risk diversification</q></p> \n<p>But here's the thing: despite years of data, most NFL teams still have no idea how to work the draft most effectively.</p> \n<p>It's not their imperfect player evaluation, but <span>something more basic — their refusal to follow the principle of risk diversification. </span><span>That's the conclusion </span><span>economists Cade Massey and Richard Thaler came to after analyzing</span><span> fifteen years of draft data in a </span><a style=""background-color: #ffffff; line-height: 1.5;"" target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.nber.org/papers/w11270"">series</a><span> of </span><a target=""_blank"" href=""http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=697121"">papers</a> — and it's still true, despite recent changes to the wages rookies are paid.</p> \n<p>Draft picks can be traded, and the success of any one player picked is highly uncertain. Because of that, their data says that in the current trade market, teams are <i>always</i> better off trading down — that is, trading one high pick for multiple lower ones — but many teams become overconfident in their evaluation of one particular player and do the exact opposite: package several low picks for the right to take one player very early.</p> \n<p>""There are one or two teams out there that philosophically follow this idea,""<span> says Massey, who serves as a draft consultant with several NFL teams that he can't disclose. ""But i</span><span>n my experience, teams always say they're on board with it in January. Then when April rolls around, and they've been preparing for the draft for a long time, they fall in love with players, get more and more confident in their analysis, and fall back into the same patterns.""</span></p> \n<p><img src=""http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/assets/4410091/3464206.jpg"" class=""photo"" alt=""3464206""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">A babyfaced Eli Manning: not worth what the Giants gave up to get the first pick. Photo by Chris Trotman/Getty Images</p> \n<h3>1) It's just not worth it to trade up</h3> \n<p><span>The first analysis Massey and Thaler did was to compare what teams are willing to pay to pick higher (in terms of extra draft picks packaged as part of a trade) with the value they ultimately get out of doing so, in terms of player production.</span></p> \n<p>To calculate how much teams pay to trade up, they looked at 1,078 trades made between 1990 and 2008. The trades work something like this: a team will trade the 16th and 32nd overall picks, say, for the 5th overall pick. They might also include picks from next year's draft.</p> \n<p>Massey and Thaler graphed all trades, which let them assign a relative value to each pick in the first five rounds of the draft:</p> \n<p><img style=""line-height: 1.5;"" src=""http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/assets/4408903/Screen_Shot_2014-05-05_at_12.55.38_PM.png"" class=""photo"" alt=""Screen_shot_2014-05-05_at_12.55.38_pm""></p> \n<p><a target=""_blank"" href=""http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=697121""></a></p> \n<p class=""caption""><a target=""_blank"" href=""http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=697121"">Massey and Thaler 2012</a></p> \n<p>The most important thing about this graph: the curve is very, very sharp in the first round (picks 1 through 32). That means teams think the very top picks are <i>extremely</i> valuable: <span>the value of the 10th pick is only about half that of the first pick.</span></p> \n<p>Now, it's worth pointing out that for years, <span>most teams followed something called ""</span><a style=""background-color: #ffffff; line-height: 1.5;"" target=""_blank"" href=""http://walterfootball.com/draftchart.php"">The Chart</a><span>,"" which assigned theoretically fair point values to each pick in the draft for trade purposes. Since </span><span>2008, many teams have smartly stopped treating ""The Chart"" as gospel, and the curve has become slightly less steep.</span></p> \n<p>But Massey says it still hasn't flattened out to anything near where it should be, in terms of the actual value derived from the players picked.</p> \n<p>He and Thaler figured this out by <span>calculating the odds that the first player picked at any given position will perform better — in terms of the number of games he starts in his first five seasons — than the second player drafted at that position. This is relevant because a team will often trade up when they identify a player they prefer at a needed position: they need a wide receiver, and a few highly-rated ones are available, but they trade up because they're </span><i style=""line-height: 1.5;"">certain</i><span> one is much better.</span></p> \n<p>But the data says that teams just aren't very good at figuring out when this is true. On average, the chance that first player will start more games than the second one picked at his position: 52 percent. Compared to the third, it's still only 55 percent, and compared to the fourth, it's merely 56 percent.</p> \n<p><q class=""center"" aria-hidden=""true"">the chance that the first player picked at a position will start more games than the second is just 52 percent</q></p> \n<p>These numbers suggest that moving up eight picks (the average distance between the first and second players at the same position) should cost a small amount, since you're only increasing the odds of a getting a more productive player by four percent or so. But as the steep curve shows, teams pay a ton to move up, especially at the top of the draft.</p> \n<p>""It's basically a coin flip,"" Massey says, ""but teams are paying a great deal for the right to call which side of the coin.""</p> \n<p>One <span>recent trade epitomizes this point — and shows that even in the post-""Chart"" era, teams still overvalue the highest picks</span><span>. In 2012, the Washington football team traded the 6th pick, the 39th pick, and their first round picks in 2013 and 2014 to the St. Louis Rams so they could move up four spots and take Robert Griffin III — a player they were </span><i style=""line-height: 1.5;"">certain </i><span>was a </span><span>once-in-a-lifetime quarterback — </span><span>with the second overall pick.</span></p> \n<p><span>Just two years later, the trade already looks pretty shortsighted. That's not because Griffin is a bad player (he's almost one of the few that might make a crazy trade like this seem worthwhile)</span><span>, but because the odds of getting a great player with one high pick are so much lower than getting one with four high picks.</span></p> \n<p><span>The team would've been better</span><span> served sitting tight and just drafting the next-best quarterback (Ryan Tannehill) and using the other three picks on much-needed players. Or they could have waited and drafted</span><span> a quarterback this year — say, Johnny Manziel — when they would've had the 2nd overall pick themselves if they hadn't made the trade.</span></p> \n<h3>2) It really pays off to trade down</h3> \n<p><span></span></p> \n<p><img alt=""470194287"" class=""photo"" src=""http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/assets/4410107/470194287.jpg""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Philip Rivers: just part of the valuable package the Giants gave up to take Eli Manning. Photo by Christian Petersen/Getty Images</p> \n<p>Given that teams, on the whole, are irrationally willing to pay a lot to trade up, smart teams can reap huge benefits by trading down. Even staying put and drafting from your original spot, the researchers' analysis shows, is not a good strategy.</p> \n<p>For each pick in the first round, they calculated all of the different two-pick packages a team could've gotten by trading down, based on the historical data (a team with the first pick, for instance, could get the 2nd and 181st picks, or the 14th and 15th picks, or any combination of picks in between that provide the same sum value).</p> \n<p><q class=""right"" aria-hidden=""true"">teams are imperfect talent evaluators, so having two later picks is better than a single early one</q></p> \n<p>Then they calculated what teams get out of these picks on average, in terms of the number of starts a player provides in his first five years and the number of Pro Bowls he's voted to. (They included Pro Bowls to counter the criticism that their analysis ignores the unique impact of superstar players solely available in the first few picks.)</p> \n<p>Again, the data was unequivocal. On average, trading down and getting two players gave a team five more starts per season and slightly more total Pro Bowls.</p> \n<p>You could chalk this up to the simple fact that more players start more games, but it's more than that. Even if you imagined that the team trading down could only keep the better one of the two players it drafted, it'd <i>still</i> get slightly more total starts and the same number of Pro Bowls. The truth is that teams are imperfect talent evaluators, so having two later picks is better than a single early one. Risk diversification at work.</p> \n<h3>3) Players picked lower are cheaper</h3> \n<p>All of these reasons to trade down don't even include the fact that players picked later in the draft get paid lower salaries, because the NFL collective bargaining agreement sets wages for the first few years of players' careers <span>based on their draft slot. Saving money matters because all teams have to abide by a hard salary cap — this year, it's </span><a style=""background-color: #ffffff; line-height: 1.5;"" href=""http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/writer/jason-la-canfora/24466063/nfl-salary-cap-where-each-team-stands-as-free-agency-looms"" target=""_blank"">$133 million</a><span> — so paying less to draft picks means more is left over for veteran players.</span></p> \n<p>For every single spot in the draft, the researchers compared the amount of salary paid to a player with the value a team gets from him on the field. (For this analysis, they used a more sophisticated metric for value: they looked at the average statistical production yielded by a player taken at that spot of the draft between 1994 and 2008, then converted that into dollars, based on what teams paid a player with that level of production on the free agent market on average<span>).</span></p> \n<p>In the graph below, the red line is the actual salary paid to a player picked at each spot, the green line is the average performance provided, and the blue is the difference — the money you save<span> drafting someone at that spot instead of having to pay more for a veteran free agent who'd play at a similar level.</span></p> \n<p><img alt=""Screen_shot_2014-05-05_at_1.52.36_pm"" class=""photo"" src=""http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/assets/4409177/Screen_Shot_2014-05-05_at_1.52.36_PM.png""><a style=""background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px;"" target=""_blank"" href=""http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=697121"">Massey and Thaler 2012</a></p> \n<p>The blue line peaks around pick 33, the start of the second round — making it the sweet spot in the draft. <span>If you had to make </span><span>one</span><span> pick, this is where you'd get</span><span> the most bang for your buck, because there's a pretty good chance of getting a productive player and he won't command a particularly high salary. </span><span>But since you can get </span><span>multiple picks</span><i style=""line-height: 1.5;""> </i><span>by trading a single high one, maximizing value means moving down into round two (picks 33 through 64). </span></p> \n<p>One caveat is that the salary data comes from picks made under the old NFL collective bargaining agreement, which paid players picked in the top 10 considerably higher salaries then they get currently. But the salaries for picks from 10 onward have barely changed — and because trading down is <i>so much</i> more fruitful, Massey says the argument still applies for the first round as a whole.</p> \n<h3>4) <span>Teams that trade down more often win more games</span>\n</h3> \n<p>The most straightforward piece of proof for all this analysis is the fact that trading down and amassing more pick value — in terms of the blue line in the graph above — correlates with more wins on the field.</p> \n<p>Massey and Thaler came to this conclusion by looking at the number of wins a team had in any given season between 1997 and 2008, and the total value of all picks they'd made in the previous four years (the amount of time, on average, a rookie is under contract for).</p> \n<p>They found that one standard deviation in pick value translated to 1.5 more wins per season on the field. Sure, it's a small sample size, and<span> there's a lot of chance and other factors built into the system — a coach's strategy, for instance — </span><span>but trading down correlates with a</span><span> significant amount of victories, given that there are only 16 games in a season.</span></p> \n<h3>So why don't more NFL teams follow this advice?</h3> \n<p><img alt=""174364155"" class=""photo"" src=""http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/assets/4410043/174364155.jpg""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Baltimore Ravens GM Ozzie Newsome knows how to draft. Photo by Rob Tringali/SportsChrome/Getty Images</p> \n<p><span>If all teams took note of these findings and corrected their behavior, the principles would no longer apply. Teams would be much less interested in trading up, so the lucrative market for trading down would evaporate.</span></p> \n<p>Why hasn't this happened?

It's not hard to imagine that NFL general managers — who are given scouting reports on players that cover everything from their body fat percentage to their home life — fall victim to the same sort of overconfidence and, as Massey said, ""fall in love"" with certain players.</span></p> \n<p>There's also the fact that the sports world as a whole tends to glamorize superstars — leading many to disproportionately attribute a 53-player roster's success to one or two highly drafted players. For a struggling GM, it might seem much easier to trade up and land a guaranteed superstar than patiently fill a roster with competent players.</p> \n<p><span>The problem, though, is that there are no guaranteed superstars — and </span><span>Thaler and Massey </span><a href=""http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/sports/56913718-77/massey-draft-nfl-teams.html.csp"" target=""_blank"" style=""background-color: #ffffff; line-height: 1.5;"">have found</a><span> that, </span><span>given a long enough timeframe, </span><span>no teams are any better at accurately evaluating prospects than others. </span><span>Sure, a GM might hit a hot streak over the course of a few drafts, but long-term, they </span><span>estimate that 95 to 100 percent of the difference in teams' odds of striking gold with any one pick</span><span> </span><span>is driven by chance.</span></p> \n<p>So the key isn't drafting better — it's just drafting more.</p> \n<p>As Cassey noted, there are a few teams out there following his philosophy.

The science of why LeBron cramped up during last night's game,http://www.vox.com/2014/6/6/5785560/the-science-of-why-lebron-cramped-up-during-last-nights-game,Dehydration and muscle fatigue can both cause cramping â€” and people with naturally high levels of sodium in their sweat are inevitably prone to it.,"<p>On Thursday night, with four minutes left in the first <span>game of this year's NBA finals, Miami Heat star LeBron James scored to pull his team within two. He immediately pulled up, then began hobbling over to his team's bench before teammates and trainers had to carry him the last few feet.</span></p> \n<p>With LeBron out, the San Antonio Spurs outscored the Heat 16-3 and won the game easily.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""right"">people with high levels of sodium in their sweat are naturally prone to cramping</q></p> \n<p>James' problem was a muscle cramp — a common, non-severe injury that struck at the worst possible moment. <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://twitter.com/cbefred/status/474755783713120257"">LeBron</a> <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://twitter.com/felicia_AOII22/status/474758759596953600"">haters</a> across the web seized it as an opportunity to question his toughness.</p> \n<p>But here's the thing: muscle cramping is a legitimate, immobilizing problem that can befall even elite athletes. D<span>ehydration and muscle fatigue are both involved, and heat can exacerbate the problem — </span><span>making </span><span>the fact that the AT&amp;T Center's air conditioning went out during the game, driving court temperatures as high as 90</span><span>°F, especially important.</span></p> \n<p><span></span></p> \n<p><span>Most importantly, some people with high levels of sodium in their sweat seem to be naturally prone to cramping. James may well fall in that category.</span></p> \n<p><span>The only real ways to relieve muscle cramping are rest, stretching, and massage. So even though LeBron surely wanted to play through the injury, it physically just wasn't possible for him to make his legs work the way they would've needed to.</span></p> \n<h3>Dehydration and muscle fatigue cause cramping</h3> \n<p>You've probably experienced a muscle cramp before: a sudden, involuntary blast of pain as one of your muscles locks up for seemingly no reason. <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exercise_Associated_Muscle_Cramps"" style=""line-height: 1.5;"">Exercise-associated muscle cramps</a>, as scientists call them, are one particular type of cramp, the kind that befell LeBron last night.</p> \n<p>Despite how common they are, scientists have <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://bjsm.bmj.com/content/43/6/401"">debated the cause</a> of these cramps for years. Part of the reason is that they're hard to study — you can't really put people in a lab and try to induce muscle cramps in them, because they happen so randomly.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""right"">both of the mechanisms can be driven by excessive heat</q></p> \n<p>Over time, two hypotheses about the cause of cramps emerged. One held that <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.sportsnutritionworkshop.com/Files/57.SPNT.pdf"">repeated overuse of specific muscles</a> leads to excessive activity in sensory receptors inside them, called <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle_spindle"">muscle spindles</a>. This activity then triggers a cascade of changes in the nervous system, ultimately disabling the mechanisms that are normally responsible for making sure muscles don't contract too much. The outcome is muscle cramping: an involuntary, excessive contraction of muscle.</p> \n<p>The other hypothesized cause is a little more intuitive: dehydration, and the <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://journals.lww.com/acsm-csmr/Fulltext/2008/07001/Muscle_Cramps_during_Exercise_Is_It_Fatigue_or.9.aspx"">resulting depletion of electrolytes</a> in your body. Over time, excessive sweating — and a failure to replace the electrolyte salts naturally present in your body — can cause sodium levels to dip dangerously. This upsets the balance of fluids in different compartments of your muscle cells, which makes your muscle fibers more likely to fire, ultimately causing your muscles to contract uncontrollably.</p> \n<p>Ultimately, most scientists have come to the conclusion that both of these mechanisms sometimes cause cramping, sometimes in combination. And both of them, it turns out, can be driven by excessive heat.</p> \n<h3>Some people are naturally more prone to cramping, and heat makes it worse</h3> \n<center> <img width=""500"" alt=""450142762"" class=""photo"" src=""http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/assets/4574099/450142762.jpg""> \n<p class=""caption"">James is carried to the bench after cramping up.

Here's what you need to know to fake it as a legit soccer fan for the 2014 World Cup.</p> \n<h3>1. The World Cup is the pinnacle of soccer</h3> \n<p><img alt=""102949159"" class=""photo"" src=""http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/assets/4590147/102949159.jpg""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Andres Iniesta holds the trophy after Spain wins the 2010 World Cup. Clive Mason/Getty Images</p> \n<p>The world's top soccer players spend most of their time playing for privately-owned teams that represent cities in country-specific leagues — like Manchester United or Real Madrid — in a system that roughly parallels American pro sports.</p> \n<p><q class=""right"" aria-hidden=""true"">It's as if Olympic hockey mattered more than the stanley cup</q></p> \n<p>But elite players also spend some of their time playing for their home countries' <span>national teams as part of the World Cup, organized by FIFA (the </span>Fédération Internationale de Football Association)<span>. Unlike American sports, these matches are considered the pinnacle of the sport — not in terms of quality of play, but in terms of the importance assigned to it. </span></p> \n<p><span> </span><a href=""http://www.sbnation.com/a/world-cup-preview-2014/intro"" target=""_blank"">FIFA claims half of humanity</a><span> tuned into one match or another during the last World Cup. It's as if Olympic hockey mattered more than the Stanley Cup, or the World Baseball Classic was more important than the (poorly named) World Series.</span></p> \n<p>We're about to start the<span> World Cup finals, which take place every four years. 32 national teams compete in a tournament held in one country over the course of about a month, with billions of people watching worldwide. The last one, in 2010, was</span><span> held in South Africa, and Spain won.</span></p> \n<p>But in between each of these tournaments, there are hundreds of qualifying matches that winnow the field down from 209 national teams to the 32 that make the final tournament.</p> \n<p><img src=""http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/assets/4585917/2014_world_cup_qualification.png"" class=""photo"" alt=""2014_world_cup_qualification""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">The 32 blue countries have teams in the World Cup finals.

The World Cup finals are a multi-stage tournament</h3> \n<p>The month-long tournament is divided into two stages. First, as part of the group stage, each team played the three other countries in its group.</p> \n<p><q class=""right"" aria-hidden=""true"">in the group stage, each team plays the other three in its group</q></p> \n<p>For example, <a href=""http://www.sbnation.com/a/world-cup-preview-2014/usa"" target=""_blank"">the US</a> was in Group G, with Ghana, Portugal, and Germany.<span> They played each of these teams once (on June 16, 22, and 26, respectively), and the three other teams played each other once as well.</span></p> \n<p>In this stage, a win counts for three points, a draw counts for one point, and a loss is zero points. When all these matches finished on June 26, the two teams with the most points from each group advanced. In Group G, that was Germany and the US.</p> \n<p>On June 28, the winning 16 teams entered a single-elimination tournament, called the knockout stage. It works pretty much like the NCAA tournament — 16 teams get cut down to 8, then 4, then 2 teams as each round progresses.</p> \n<p>In this phase, there are no draws: tie matches are followed by 30 minutes of extra time (divided into two 15-minute halves). This extra time isn't sudden death — it continues for the full 30 minutes, even if either team scores. Afterward, if both teams are still tied, they enter <span>a penalty kick shootout, in which each time takes five shots and the team with the most goals wins.</span></p> \n<h3>3. The US team was in the ""group of death"" — but made it out</h3> \n<p><img src=""http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/assets/4590155/184716630.jpg"" class=""photo"" alt=""184716630""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">The US men's national team poses before an October 23 match against Panama.

They weren't able to change that this year, with a heartbreaking 2-1 loss to a tough Belgium team in the first round of knockout play this year.</span></p> \n<h3><span>4.

Soccer is a complex game</h3> \n<center> \n<p><img width=""450"" alt=""Screen_shot_2014-06-10_at_9.33.15_am"" class=""photo"" src=""http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/assets/4590219/Screen_Shot_2014-06-10_at_9.33.15_AM.png""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">The 4-2-3-1 formation, increasingly popular in recent years. (<a target=""_blank"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_(association_football)#mediaviewer/File:Association_football_4-2-3-1_formation.svg"" style=""line-height: 1.5;"">Threner/Wikimedia commons</a>)</p> \n</center> \n<p>To a casual viewer, soccer might seem pretty straightforward: you have two teams of eleven players on a field (called a pitch), both trying to put a spherical ball into the other team's goal. They can use any part of their body besides their arms or hands to do so, except the goalie (called a keeper), who can use his hands as long as he's within a box in front of his own net.</p> \n<p>The nuances of the game, though, are more complicated than you might expect. Among the important rules to know:</p> \n<ul> \n<li>An offensive player is <b>offside</b> if he is in the attacking half of the field, doesn't have the ball, and goes behind the second-farthest back defender (including the keeper). If this player gets involved in the play — say, by being passed the ball — it's a violation, and the other teams gets a <b>free kick</b>. This complex rule is intended to prevent offensive players from just sitting by the net, waiting for the ball.</li> \n<li>A <b>yellow card </b>is shown to a player after he commits a misconduct, a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misconduct_(association_football)"" target=""_blank"">type of foul</a>. If he commits a second misconduct, a <b>red card </b>is shown, and he's ejected — forcing his team to play one man down for the rest of the match.</li> \n<li>A <b>throw-in </b>occurs when the ball is kicked out of bounds along one of the side lines. When it goes out the end line, a <b>goal kick </b>occurs if it was last touched by an offensive player, and a <b>corner kick </b>occurs if it was last touched by a defensive player or the keeper.</li> \n<li>The match lasts 90 minutes (with two 45-minute halves), and the clock never stops. Not for goals, injuries, or any time-outs. Instead, referees <a href=""http://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/20159223"" target=""_blank"">add <span>stoppage time</span></a> to the end of the match to cover the time used up on substitutions and goal celebrations.</li> \n<li>Each team is allowed three <b>substitutions</b> over the course of a match. For the World Cup, rosters are limited to 23 players: 11 starters and 12 subs.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>A team is made up of ten defenders, midfielders, and forwards — with varying numbers of each for strategic reasons — <span>plus one keeper. Different coaches use all sorts of different numbers and formations of the first three: currently, the 4-2-3-1 formation (four defenders, two defensive midfielders, three attacking midfielders, and a forward) is especially popular.</span></p> \n<p>But apart from their formations, teams have radically different strategies and styles. <a href=""http://www.sbnation.com/a/world-cup-preview-2014/germany"" target=""_blank"">Germany</a> has long been known for organization and efficiency, <a href=""http://www.sbnation.com/a/world-cup-preview-2014/spain"" target=""_blank"">Spain</a> makes many short, high-percentage passes, <a href=""http://www.sbnation.com/a/world-cup-preview-2014/argentina"" target=""_blank"">Argentina</a> has an explosive offense led by Lionel Messi, and <a href=""http://www.sbnation.com/a/world-cup-preview-2014/brazil"" target=""_blank"">Brazil</a> uses speed to press aggressively. Like any sport, <a href=""http://grantland.com/features/how-to-watch-the-world-cup-like-a-true-soccer-nerd/"" target=""_blank"" style=""line-height: 1.5; background-color: #ffffff;"">the strategy of soccer goes very deep</a>.</p> \n<h3>6.

But the 12 stadiums are spread widely across Brazil, a country nearly as large as the US.</p> \n<p>As a result, the tournament will entail long-distance travel for the teams. From the US team's first match, in Natal, they'll fly about 1,700 miles to Manaus, for their second match.</p> \n<center> <img alt=""Screen_shot_2014-06-09_at_5.21.52_pm"" class=""photo"" src=""http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/assets/4587699/Screen_Shot_2014-06-09_at_5.21.52_PM.png""> \n<p class=""caption"">The 12 sites of the 2014 World Cup.

They may have forgotten about it — I had one in here last week, we could tell from the X-ray, and he said, ""Oh, I remember now, when I was 12 I missed a month of baseball with a sore elbow.""

If you're a major league pitching coach, you're probably good at recognizing it. But it gets harder and harder to spot as you go down in the youth levels. Some coaches mean well, but they don't recognize fatigue when it's obvious. There's a lot being done at the youth level that needs to be under better control. So we need a better education process. We've had a tenfold increase in injuries in youth baseball since 2000.

But I'm a football guy, and I may be too biased.</p> \n<p>But there are ways we've got to make football safer. The first is pre-participation exams, and ruling out kids that shouldn't be playing. Another thing is having physiological age groups: two kids can both be 12 years old, but if they've matured at different rates, that's a huge mismatch. We have weight limits sometimes, but those don't always work.

Some schools have them, but not all. Some states mandate it, but don't provide any funds for it. That's a joke.</p> \n<p>The other thing is that we need more education on injury prevention, during games and practice. This includes parameters for practicing in the heat.

Often, they have to pay for them to come, and it's expensive as hell, so the ambulance is there at the start of the game, but if they get a call to go somewhere else, they just leave. So a kid gets hurt, and he can die on the field because he has no ambulance to get him to the hospital.</p> \n<p>So there are all these problems.

How did that happen?</p> \n<p><span class=""interviewee"">Dr. James Andrews:</span>Number one: never take anything for granted. If you start planning your career to have a claim like that, you're probably not going to be successful. You've got to let it happen. Like Yogi Berra said, ""When you come to a fork in the road, take it."" You can't plan everything, or start patting yourself on the back and thinking you've got it made.</p> \n<p>For me, I never consider myself anything more than an ordinary orthopedic surgeon that's interested in sports. The two things that have made me successful are accessibility and communication.</p> \n<p>And the other thing to know is that getting to be successful is not as difficult as people think. You learn from your mistakes, and you can be successful. The problem is maintaining it, being able to stay there. Even the elite athletes in sports, they fall off — you have to really watch out to maintain your success in any profession. And if you start patting yourself on the back, you're dammed sure going to fall off.</p> \n<p><span class=""interviewer"">Joseph Stromberg:</span> What's a normal day look like for you?</p> \n<p><span class=""interviewee"">Dr. James Andrews:</span>I usually say, ""go to bed early and get up early."" But earlier in my career, I never did that — I went to bed late and got up early. As I got older, though, I learned to start going to be earlier.</p> \n<p>My day is not as complicated as you might think. I do about half the number of surgeries I did three to four years ago. When I moved down to Pensacola, I designed my practice to be more reasonable in my older age, in terms of how many cases I can do a week.

That athletic world is very difficult.</p> \n<p><span class=""interviewer"">Joseph Stromberg:</span>What makes treating athletes so difficult?</p> \n<p><span class=""interviewee"">Dr. James Andrews:</span>Well for younger ones, you've got to make sure their parents are on the same page with what you're doing. The younger they are, the more reassuring you've got to be with their parents, and even more important, their grandparents. You've got a whole slew of people. And with young kids, you've got to be careful of being too aggressive in operating on them — a lot of times, you've got to let mother nature take its course.</p> \n<p>With college athletes, it becomes more complicated because you've got the school, the athletic trainer, the team physician, the coaches, the school insurance to worry about.

And if you don't handle it properly, they'll just say whatever they want to say. So it just gets more complicated as you go up the ladder.</p> \n<p><span class=""interviewer"">Joseph Stromberg:</span>When you have multiple athletes that want to see you, how do you decide how to spend your time?</p> \n<p><span class=""interviewee"">Dr. James Andrews:</span>When an athlete calls, I just pick up the phone, and say ""come on down."" They've all got my number.</p> \n<p>I had a professional basketball player from Belgium call me today, he tore his knee up, and I said ""come on Monday, we'll take care of you."" You have to do that, that's accessibility. It all starts from answering the telephone. You can't always do that, but if you don't get people in in a timely fashion, you have a lot of fences you've got to mend.</p> \n<p>I just got a letter this weekend from a mother of a patient. I remember her: she was a high school USA gymnast, who had a bad elbow. She then joined the Auburn gymnastic team, but I continued to be her doctor, all the way through college. Now she's 30, and her elbow is hurting her, and she tried to get in to see me. But unfortunately, they called Birmingham, who doesn't make appointments for me anymore, and they didn't know I was in Pensacola, and they didn't tell her where I was. The mother finally sent me a letter, and I felt so bad, I wrote her a three-page letter apologizing for not having been available. That's what I call mending fences. I felt terrible about it.</p> \n<p><span class=""interviewer"">Joseph Stromberg:</span>When you're dealing with pro athletes, if a player wants to go back on the field, and the agent, or management, or team doctors want the same, but you think the player isn't ready — how do you address that tension?</p> \n<p><span class=""interviewee"">Dr. James Andrews:</span> Well, the team physician always has the final say. Now if I operate on the patient, and the team physician didn't, then I take precedence.

I wake up at 6 a.m. on Monday morning, after the weekend, and start thinking about the patients having trouble. I call it my ""worry list."" I did an ACL last week, and the patient left having some pain. First thing I did when I got to work, I had my nurse call him, and he was doing fine. I still have him on my worry list, but not as high up on it as he was before.</p> \n<p><span class=""interviewer"">Joseph Stromberg:</span>You mentioned the press just reporting what they want. Are there ever cases where the public impression of an injury are totally different than the reality?</p> \n<p><span class=""interviewee"">Dr. James Andrews:</span>Yes. That's because of a lack of communication, by everyone — not just the press.</p> \n<p>But teams, in general, will put out as little information about an injury as they can get away with. They may call something a knee sprain, when it's a complex injury of the knee ligaments. And a lot of times, the press wants a diagnosis immediately, and you just don't know.</p> \n<p>And the press is always going to report something, from the bits and pieces they do get. And I'm not criticizing it, because that's their job.</p> \n<p>On the sidelines, as a sports medicine physician, you have to make quick decisions, sometimes with less than perfect information. The press will say, ""pending an MRI, it's this injury."" But your exam, and your medical history, are a lot more important than an MRI. The public thinks that MRIs are the name of the game for everything, but they're way over-emphasized.</p> \n<p><span class=""interviewer"">Joseph Stromberg:</span>What do you think are the big emerging technologies that we should be paying attention to, right now, in sports medicine?</p> \n<p><span class=""interviewee"">Dr. James Andrews:</span>The big revelation over the last 40 years was the arthroscope.

But it's coming.</p> \n<p><span class=""interviewer"">Joseph Stromberg:</span>Why are players going to Europe for that sort of thing right now?</p> \n<p><span class=""interviewee"">Dr. James Andrews:</span>Well the FDA controls what we do here. Over there, they can do more without controls, so some other countries are further along. For example, South Korea is pretty far along, and Japan, and Germany. We're controlled by the FDA, which is rightfully looking after the safety of the patients.</p> \n<p>A lot of this stuff being done outside the US hasn't been proven yet, and you have to be careful to see whether it's legal within US sports leagues. My thought is that we need to push forward the research here in the US, where it's safe and under control. We'll always have the FDA restrictions, and those are for the safety of the patients, so I applaud the FDA for not letting things get out of control. So we have to work within those parameters.</p> \n<p><span class=""interviewer"">Joseph Stromberg:</span>You recently wrote a <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.asmi.org/research.php?page=research&amp;section=TJpositionstatement"">position statement</a> on the rash of Tommy Johns' injuries in baseball right now. What do you think is causing it?</p> \n<p><span class=""interviewee"">Dr. James Andrews:</span>I think the biggest thing is overuse, especially during childhood. If you look at the major league pitchers that I'm seeing, if you study their history, you'll find that they had injuries during their youth. They may have forgotten about it — I had one in here last week, we could tell from the X-ray, and he said, ""Oh, I remember now, when I was 12 I missed a month of baseball with a sore elbow."" About 50 percent have some pre-existing minor injury from overuse that was ignored.</p> \n<p>The biggest factor, at any age group, is fatigue. If they're playing with fatigue — either from too many pitches in a game, or too many innings in a season, or from pitching year-round competitive baseball — you have 600 percent increased chance that you'll injure your shoulder or elbow.</p> \n<p>So the recognition of fatigue is extremely important. If you're a major league pitching coach, you're probably good at recognizing it. But it gets harder and harder to spot as you go down in the youth levels. Some coaches mean well, but they don't recognize fatigue when it's obvious. There's a lot being done at the youth level that needs to be under better control. So we need a better education process. We've had a tenfold increase in injuries in youth baseball since 2000. Something has to be done about it.</p> \n<p>But let me tell you — there was one particular thing in the position statement that was a little controversial, and I'd like to clarify it.</p> \n<p>It's about curveballs. In the lab, at the American Sports Medicine Institute, Glenn Fleisig found that the forces across the shoulder and elbow among a select group of youth baseball pitchers are no greater when they throw a curveball, compared to a fastball. And so we extrapolated that it's okay for young kids to throw a curveball before their growth plates close.</p> \n<p>But I don't agree with that at all. Here's the problem: throwing a curveball is a highly sophisticated pitch. It takes good neuro musclar control. So if a kid can throw a curveball with  good mechanics, then the lab tests are accurate. The problem is that few kids in that age group have good enough coordination and control to throw it correctly. And most of them don't have a coach who's knowledge enough to teach them to throw it with the right mechanics.</p> \n<p>So I think it's not safe to make a blanket statement that kids, pre-puberty, can throw a curveball. If you give them that leeway, all parents will say their kids have great mechanics, but they wouldn't know that. Most kids can't do that. So I say kids should not throw a curveball until they shave. Teach them how to throw a fastball and a changeup, that's it.</p> \n<p> </p> \n<p><span class=""interviewer"">Joseph Stromberg:</span>What about everything we're learning about football and injuries — head injuries, but also the overall toll the game takes on players' bodies?

The 9 economic factors driving LeBron James back into free agency,http://www.vox.com/2014/6/24/5837738/the-9-economic-factors-driving-lebron-james-back-into-free-agency,Basketball is a sport but the NBA is a business. A business with a lot of very complicated financial rules to consider. This is what LeBron James is up to.,"<p>This morning news leaked that LeBron James, the most famous active basketball player in the world and arguably the best, is going to opt out from the final year of his contract with the Miami Heat and become a free agent. Interestingly, however, this doesn't mean that LeBron is going to leave the Heat. And it doesn't even mean that LeBron is going to try to get the Heat to pay him more money. Instead, opting out is a negotiating tactic that's primarily aimed at getting his teammates — specifically Chris Bosh and Dwyane Wade — to accept pay cuts in order to make it more likely that the Heat will win a championship in the future.</p> \n<h3>1) LeBron James and all other NBA stars are underpaid</h3> \n<p>The key fact about LeBron James and every other truly first-rate player in the National Basketball Association (guys like Kevin Durant, Chris Paul, etc.) is that he is underpaid. It may sound odd to describe a person getting paid a $19 million salary as ""underpaid"" but it's true.</p> \n<p>The basic reason for this is that the collective bargaining agreement between the league's owners and the players' union is unfavorable to the top talent in the league. It imposes a maximum amount of money that any given player can be paid in any given year. The max varies according to years of service in the league and other factors, but for a top player in his prime like LeBron it is generally considerably less than he could earn on the open market. Indeed, underpaying the top players is the whole point of the rule.</p> \n<p>One somewhat unanticipated consequence of imposing this rule is that since star players are underpaid wherever they end up, stars are increasingly considering non-monetary issues when deciding where to play. Due to the individual maximum salary rule, we can be sure that LeBron <i>isn't</i> opting out primarily in an effort to get a raise for himself — his salary is limited not by market conditions but by the collective bargaining agreement.</p> \n<h3><span>2) Teams can only spend so much on salary</span></h3> \n<p>The other big structural factor that's relevant is that NBA teams are subject to what's called a <i>salary cap</i>, a series of rules whereby NBA team owners collude to reduce the amount of money they spend on player compensation. <a href=""http://www.cbafaq.com/salarycap.htm"">The details of the salary cap are extremely complicated</a>, but broadly speaking the point of the cap is that you can't simply go out and hire all the best players.</p> \n<p>This means that when teams are hiring players, it is crucial to consider not just the quality of the player but the <i>value proposition</i> the player provides. Teams are working with a somewhat fixed pool of financial resources, so the <i>opportunity cost</i> of hiring very expensive players is large.</p> \n<p>That means it's extremely valuable to hire players who are underpaid. Not just in the general sense that all business owners everywhere like underpaid workers, but in the specific sense that hiring an underpaid worker helps you fit more fairly paid players onto your roster.</p> \n<h3>3) Stars and rookies are the best resources</h3> \n<p>Put facts number one and two together and you can begin to see why LeBron's decision-making is so critically important. To win in the NBA, it is crucial to assemble some underpaid talent. One way to assemble underpaid talent is for your organization to become consistently good at identifying underrated players. But this is difficult. What's much easier is to simply take advantage of the rules.</p> \n<p>Players who are new to the league are forced to play for rookie scale contracts that limit their salary regardless of skill. And players who are extremely talented have their earnings potential limited by the maximum salary rule. That means that the two greatest sources of value in the NBA are superstars like James and highly skilled rookies. Any team that manages to hire LeBron James secures the services of not just one of the best players in the league, but a player who generates wins far out of proportion to his salary.</p> \n<h3>4) James took a pay cut to play in Miami</h3> \n<p>LeBron James has been at the center of free agent drama before. He was drafted by the Cleveland Cavaliers in 2003 and played with them through the 2009-2010 season. At the end of the season, he departed in free agency to join Dwyane Wade on the Miami Heat. Wade and James were also joined by Chris Bosh, formerly of the Toronto Raptors. All three players were drafted in 2003 and had been perennial All-Stars for years. They were also close friends.</p> \n<p>Given the salary cap rules, it was not possible for the Heat to pay all three players the individual maximum salary. But they all decided that they wanted to play together and maximize their odds at winning championships, so they all agreed to accept small discounts to play in Miami. The sting of reduced salary was salved by Miami's high quality of life and the fact that Florida has no state income tax.</p> \n<p>The terms of the arrangement were that Wade, James, and Bosh would all accept essentially the same salary (James and Bosh are paid the exact same amount, Wade is paid very slightly less) even though everyone agreed that James was the superior player.</p> \n<h3>5) LeBron is amazing, but the Heat need more talent</h3> \n<p>When James signed with the Heat, he was unquestionably the best player in the NBA. And he led Miami to a loss in the NBA Finals followed by two straight victories, and then this spring another NBA Finals appearance. (The Heat lost to the San Antonio Spurs, four games to one.)</p> \n<p>And while James is still amazing (he was probably the second-best player in the NBA last year after Oklahoma City's Kevin Durant), Bosh and especially Wade have become less effective due to age and injury. Meanwhile, the quality of the ""supporting cast"" of players behind the big three has deteriorated substantially. Udonis Haslem, Ray Allen, and Shane Battier have all seen their effectiveness deteriorate with age; Mike Miller left the team; and Chris ""Birdman"" Andersen can only play limited minutes.</p> \n<p>Indeed, the fact that the Heat made it to the Finals this year probably overstates their quality. For a variety of reasons, the Eastern Conference in which the Heat play has become <i>much</i> weaker than the Western Conference. Miami was probably the fourth-best team in the NBA last year, and their age problems are only getting worse.</p> \n<h3>6) To improve, the Heat need Wade and Bosh to take pay cuts</h3> \n<p>Because of the salary cap, the Heat can't easily improve by simply going out and hiring more good players. They are currently scheduled to pay a combined $61 million to their big three next year, which leaves little room for free agent signing. A solid rookie or two could make a huge difference, but the Heat have not had much success with this in recent years (in part because the draft process deliberately penalizes good teams) and it would be unwise to count on this working.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, Bosh and Wade, who were clearly underpaid at an earlier point in their careers, are now arguably overpaid. Because maximum salary levels increase continuously with age but player effectiveness does not, there is a tendency for young underpaid stars to become old overpaid ex-stars very rapidly.</p> \n<p>Wade and Bosh, like James, have a one-year player option remaining on their contract. They each are entitled, in other words, to be paid $20 million by the Heat next year. The best scenario for the Heat, however, would be for both of them to opt-out and then sign new contracts that last several years and pay a lower annual rate. That would allow Miami to resign LeBron to a new maximum salary deal <i>and</i> go out and hire another free agent or two. The message LeBron is sending by opting out is that if Wade, Bosh, and the Heat don't work something like this out, he'll leave town.</p> \n<h3>7) LeBron's non-Miami options are not that great</h3> \n<p>LeBron is so good that any team would gladly hire him, and a number of teams have the ability to pay him a maximum salary. But to the extent that LeBron wants to earn a maximum salary <i>and</i> contend for a championship, his non-Miami options are not actually all that appealing.</p> \n<p>The disparity between the Western and Eastern Conferences is very relevant here. Most of the teams where LeBron could go and join other quality players — places like Houston and Dallas — are in the Western Conference where most of the good players are. But in the West, LeBron would need to battle the existing powers — the San Antonio Spurs, the Oklahoma City Thunder, and the LA Clippers — to even make it to the Finals. In the East, by contrast, the bar to play in the championship series is much lower. In the East the only other team with an established track record of quality is the Indiana Pacers who can't afford to pay him very much.</p> \n<p>LeBron could choose to join an Eastern Conference team with some promising young talent — Philadelphia or Charlotte or Cleveland  — but that would be a big risk.</p> \n<h3>8) The last time LeBron was a free agent, it was a PR disaster</h3> \n<p>LeBron's previous spell as a free agent back in 2010 was highly anticipated. So highly anticipated that he turned it into a 75-minute special on ESPN called ""<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Decision_(TV_special)"">The Decision</a>.""</p> \n<p>On its face, leveraging public interest in the story into a fundraiser for charity was a nice idea that should have increased the public's esteem in LeBron. But the execution was somewhat tasteless, and helped feed a public backlash against LeBron and the Heat. Since that time, he has largely repaired the damage done to his reputation. But any time a player leaves his longtime team there's a tendency to generate ill will, and James is doubtless eager to avoid a new backlash.</p> \n<p>Here's where this move gets a bit dicey. Having scorned the Cleveland fan base for a chance at winning rings with his friends in Miami, James is now threatening to abandon them unless they agree to settle for less money. That's not exactly endearing behavior. Rationally, it is difficult to fault LeBron for either move. He did not choose to play in Cleveland in the first place, nor is he the architect of the league rules that create the salary jam in Miami. Every working American should be entitled to use the bargaining power he has to get the best possible deal. But unless the situation is resolved swiftly and amicably, the power move seems likely to land LeBron back on the celebrity villain list.</p> \n<h3><span>9) LeBron makes a ton of money outside of basketball</span></h3> \n<p>In theory, LeBron could agree to play for the league minimum salary and still have an extraordinarily high income. Kurt Badenhausen at Forbes <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/kurtbadenhausen/2014/01/22/lebron-james-endorsements-breakdown-by-the-numbers/"">estimates his annual earnings from endorsements at $42 million a year</a>.</p> \n<p>He also <a href=""http://www.sbnation.com/nba/2014/6/11/5802428/lebron-james-beats-dr-dre-apple-money-money-money"">made $30 million when Beats was sold to Apple</a>.</p> \n<p>On the one hand, this means that James is clearly able to make financial sacrifices in order to pursue other goals (championships, glory) if he so desires. It also means that the exact extent of the financial tradeoffs isn't entirely clear. LeBron's ability to continue earning huge endorsement deals depends in part on his ability to continue playing deep into the playoffs, which hinges in part on the quality of his teammates.</p>",Sports

You give your team a name. Congratulations: you are now a</span><span> team ""owner.""</span></p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""right"">you and the other owners start by holding a draft and picking players</q></p> \n<p>Just before the start of the season, you and the other owners (there are usually 10 or 12 in a league) hold a draft, in which each of you picks <span>the NFL players you want on your team. Each player can only be on one team in your league. After the draft — and throughout the season — you can tinker with your roster by picking up players who didn't get drafted, dropping players you no longer want, and trading with other owners.</span></p> \n<p>Then, for each week of the regular season, you select a subset of the players on your team as ""starters."" Usually, it's one quarterback, two running backs, two wide receivers, a tight end, a kicker and a team's defense, although these numbers vary a bit from league to league. At a minimum, y<span>ou need to take out the players who are injured or </span><a href=""http://www.sbnation.com/a/fantasy-football-draft-guide-2014/bye_week"" target=""_blank"">on a bye week</a><span> (each NFL team has one week off during the year).</span></p> \n<p>Each week, your starters go up against the starters of another owner in your league each week. You get points for the yards, touchdowns, field goals, and other stats your players produce in real life, and so does your opponent. At the end of the week's games, whoever has more points gets a win. This goes on for the whole season, eventually leading to a champion.</p> \n<h3><span>4) What players should I draft?</span></h3> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3995026/GettyImages-461085218.0.jpg"" alt=""Le"" data-chorus-asset-id=""3995026""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">(Justin K. Aller/Getty Images)</p> \n<p>The basic idea is that you want to draft <span>players at each position who will get you lots of points. Every expert has their own personal preferences and draft philosophy, but there's generally a basic understanding, heading into the season, of who the best players are.</span></p> \n<p><a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.sbnation.com/a/fantasy-football-draft-guide-2015"">SB Nation has an excellent guide</a>, with<span> lists of the </span><a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.sbnation.com/a/fantasy-football-draft-guide-2015/overall-rankings"">top overall players</a><span>, the top </span><a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.sbnation.com/a/fantasy-football-draft-guide-2015/qb"">players at each position</a><span>, ""</span><a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.sbnation.com/a/fantasy-football-draft-guide-2015/sleepers"">sleepers</a><span>"" (players that will be drafted low but might do better than expected), and </span><a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.sbnation.com/a/fantasy-football-draft-guide-2015/potential-busts"">potential ""busts""</a><span> (players who, for various reasons, might underperform this year). </span></p> \n<p>However, if you don't feel like putting forth any effort, you can always just rely on your league platform's default rankings as you draft. If you don't even want to do that, you can just ignore the draft and do something else with your time, and the system will auto-draft your players for you — but what's the fun in that?</p> \n<h3><span>5) Should I talk about my roster with lots of people?</span></h3> \n<p>Absolutely not. Though your draft results might be very exciting to you, the truth is that to other people — especially ones who aren't in your league — hearing about the players you picked is a lot like hearing about <span>your dreams, or the upset that ruined your NCAA bracket. They're just not relevant.</span></p> \n<p>This goes for the regular season, too. <span>Your glorious wins and painful losses simply have no meaning beyond the ten or twelve people in your league, if that.</span></p> \n<p><span>Anyone who plays fantasy is guilty of occasionally violating this rule, but n</span><span>o one likes the person who works his or her team into every conversation. Please do not be that person.</span></p> \n<h3>6) Why would I want to do all this?</h3> \n<p><chorus-asset data-id=""654378""> <img src=""http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/654378/12312845314_413a71e769_o.0.jpg"" class=""small"" alt=""fantasy football trophy""> </chorus-asset></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Do everything right and you just might win your league. (<a href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/ktao1/12312845314"">Kevin Tao</a>)</p> \n<p>That's a great question. Fantasy is undoubtedly a weird, non-intuitive way to watch sports, and it takes time. And yet millions of people and increasingly obsessed with it. Why?</p> \n<p>One factor is that it taps into the same control-hungry impulse that drives our love of March Madness brackets. Watching sports is fun, but the sensation of having a bit of control over the outcome can be even more exciting. We can't control whether our team wins or lose, but we can control how our fantasy team does.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""right"">fantasy football can impart meaning to tames that otherwise have none</q></p> \n<p>Another is that fantasy breaks down a big, complex game into something more manageable. Figuring out why real-life teams win or lose is really hard. But boiling things down to simple stats — like yards and touchdowns — gives football an appealing semblance of simplicity.</p> \n<p>For many people, the main reason is the fun against competing with friends or coworkers on a seemingly even playing field. Fantasy gives us something to talk about over the course of a season, and pretty much anyone can do it, even if we're not in shape to play actual football.</p> \n<p>Finally, for people who are already football fans, fantasy can impart meaning to particular games that otherwise have none. If I'm not a fan of the Buccaneers or Rams, their bout on December 17 will probably be pretty unappealing, especially since neither team is likely to be in the playoff hunt. But if I have a fantasy player on either team, it'll make the game worth watching — which is especially good because it's the sole Thursday night game, <span>so it's either Bucs and Rams or finding something else to fill my <strike>otherwise meaningless</strike> existence for one more night.</span></p> \n<h3>7) Isn't this basically gambling?</h3> \n<p><chorus-asset data-id=""654388""> <img alt=""fantasy sports money"" class=""small"" src=""http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/654388/153657252.0.jpg""> </chorus-asset></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Dolla billz.

The <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unlawful_Internet_Gambling_Enforcement_Act_of_2006"">2006 act</a> congress passed to prohibit online gambling (especially poker) included an exception for fantasy sports, officially categorizing them as ""games of skill.""</p> \n<p>But it's hard to argue that fantasy doesn't fit under the actual definition of the word  ""gambling."" <span>Most have some sort of entry fee paid at the start of the season, and provide a payout to the winner. </span></p> \n<p>The NFL, publicly at least, is strongly anti-gambling. And yet it's carved out an exception for fantasy. It doesn't just tolerate fantasy: it actively promotes it in commercials with current players, and provides a platform on NFL.com where people can play it for free.</p> \n<p>The reason is that fantasy football makes the NFL money. It's indirect — playing in a fantasy league on NFL.com is free, but the popularity of fantasy at a whole certainly drives up ratings for all games, and is especially effective at making people care about otherwise meaningless late-season games.</p> \n<p>This would also be true of conventional gambling, though. But what gives the NFL cover here is that fantasy doesn't look much like conventional gambling: there are no bookies, no casinos, and the money gets paid out only after a convoluted, season-long process, months after it was paid in originally. <span>The league has ridden this strange form of pseduo-gambling to new heights of popularity — and it doesn't seem likely to give it up anytime soon.</span></p>",Sports

He also apologized to ""the fans"" and ""the kids"" and ""everyone who was affected, you know, by this situation that, um, me and my wife were in.""</p> \n<p>People he did not apologize to included his wife.

At one point, she said she deeply regretted the role she played in the Atlantic City incident. The conference was being live tweeted by the Ravens' official Twitter account, and a staffer tweeted Palmer's apologetic remarks.

The NFL's version of manhood can be something noble, like the playing through pain that moved my father so much. But I think that for many football fans, the main feature of the NFL's image of masculinity is - troublingly - that it is so unchecked. It is not constrained by ambiguity or by the limitations that men have, relatively recently, had to learn to accept in their everyday lives. You roar in the NFL, you rage, you hit as hard as you can.

Study: More than 80 percent of football concussions goÂ unreported,http://www.vox.com/2014/10/17/6988441/concussions,Concussions are way more common than we realize,"<p>By now, it's well-established that <span>the concussions suffered by many football players can lead to </span><a style=""line-height: 1.5; background-color: #ffffff;"" href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/9/5/6106851/nfl-football-concussions"" target=""_blank"">long-term mental problems</a><span>.</span></p> \n<p>But among the many questions researchers face, one is particularly vexing: How often do these concussions actually occur?</p> \n<p>This is so tough to figure out because<span> concussions frequently go unreported in football. For years, concussions were considered a minor injury and many players simply played through them. Today, even with stricter protocols in place at the NFL and college level, some players (and perhaps coaching staffs) actively hide concussions, so they can avoid missing playing time.</span></p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""right"">for every single diagnosed concussion over the players' careers, they had four suspected and undiagnosed ones</q></p> \n<p>A <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://espn.go.com/pdf/2014/1002/Baugh-1-Unreported-OLine.pdf"">new study</a> provides a rough idea of just how often this under-reporting occurs. Researchers from Harvard and Boston University surveyed 734 college football players from ten schools on how often <span>they'd been diagnosed with concussions, how often they suspected having concussions but didn't get diagnosed, and how often they suffered ""dings"" or ""bell ringers"" (slang for rattling blows to the head that may or may not cause concussions).</span></p> \n<p>It turned out that for every single concussion suffered over the course of these players' careers<span>, they also had four suspected — but unreported — concussions, and 19 so-called ""dings."" And other data collected, on symptoms experienced by players, suggests that many of these ""dings"" were, in fact, concussions. </span></p> \n<p><span>In other words, if these numbers are accurate, more than 80 percent of concussions don't even get officially counted.</span></p> \n<h3>The data on unreported concussions</h3> \n<p>Previously, estimates for the percentage of concussions that are actually diagnosed and reported ranged from <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23243113"" style=""line-height: 1.5; background-color: #ffffff;"">50 percent</a> to <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/college/football/2004-06-15-concussions_x.htm"" style=""line-height: 1.5;"">75 percent</a>. These estimates, though, were mostly based on old data, with smaller sample sizes.</p> \n<p>The new data set comes from surveys filled out by players at ten schools in the NCAA's (confusingly-named) <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Division_I_(NCAA)#Football_Championship_Subdivision"" style=""line-height: 1.5;"">Football Championship Subdivision</a>, which is basically the level just below big-time Division I football. Among other things, the players were asked the number of concussions they'd had over the course of their careers so far, the number of times they suspected having concussions but didn't get them diagnosed, and the number of times they got a ""ding"" or had their ""bell rung."" Here were the averages:</p> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""2362338"" alt=""new concussion chart"" src=""http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2362338/Screen_Shot_2014-10-16_at_4.25.26_PM.0.png""></p> \n<p><span>Officially diagnosed concussions represented a pretty small percentage of all concussions the players thought they'd suffered — something that many researchers have previously suspected.</span></p> \n<p>Players were also asked how often they felt concussion-like symptoms after a ""ding"" (specifically, how often they felt dizzy, vomited, lost consciousness, saw stars, forgot what they were doing on the field, got headaches, or had problems concentrating in the week afterward). The average player experienced between one or two instances of each type of symptom during the 2012 season. This means that, in all likelihood, the players had suffered more than the 2.64 concussions they suspected in their careers — and some of those ""dings"" had, in fact, been concussions.</p> \n<p>Finally, the players were asked how often they returned to a game or practice while still experiencing these symptoms. On average, they'd done this 6.65 times during their college career, and 1.74 times in the previous season. The reason this is such a big deal: playing football while still experiencing concussion symptoms dramatically increases the chance of a repeat concussion, and may increase the chance of long-term problems.</p> \n<h3>Which positions suffer the most concussions?</h3> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""2362322"" alt=""offensive line"" src=""http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2362322/153216242.0.jpg""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Offensive and defensive linemen seem to suffer more unreported concussions. (Ronald Martinez/Getty Images)</p> \n<p>The researchers also sliced all their data by football position, in order to investigate a widespread hypothesis: that offensive and defensive lineman suffer a disproportionate number of undiagnosed concussions.</p> \n<p>The reason they believe this is that even though <span>these players experience lower-speed impacts than receivers and defensive backs, they </span><a style=""line-height: 1.5;"" href=""http://mmqb.si.com/2014/10/14/new-harvard-study-concussions-in-the-trenches/"" target=""_blank"">slam into each other on virtually every play</a>. Further, their impacts are less noticeable to observers, making it more feasible for them to hide their symptoms and keep playing.</p> \n<p>The data suggests that this suspicion may also be accurate. Although diagnosed concussions occurred at relatively similar rates among all groups, offensive and defensive linemen suffered slightly more suspected (but undiagnosed) concussions, and offensive linemen experienced more ""dings."" <span>Offensive linemen also suffered from all the various symptoms — and returned to play with them — </span><span>disproportionately more than any other position group.</span></p> \n<h3>Is there any solution to concussion underreporting?</h3> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""681280"" alt=""helmet hit"" src=""http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/681280/107804459.0.jpg""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">(Hunter Martin/Philadelphia Eagles/Getty Images)</p> \n<p><span>If this survey accurately represents football at other levels — both college and pro — it says two things.</span></p> \n<p><b>1)</b> Despite new rules — or perhaps because of them — players still aren't reporting all concussions, and are returning to play when they shouldn't be.</p> \n<p><b>2)</b> Linemen (especially offensive linemen) suffer the highest number of unreported concussions, and play through them most often.</p> \n<p>It might be fair to question whether this data is similar to what you'd find at top-level college football and the NFL. Training staffs and budgets are larger at those levels, and there may be more attention paid to players. At the same time, <span>the stakes are much higher for both players and coaches, so there may be even more reason to hide symptoms and keep playing.</span></p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""right"">players have short-term incentives not to follow concussion protocols</q></p> \n<p>This kind of thing is tough to fix. Creating protocols that force a player to pass tests in order to return to action (as <a href=""http://static.nfl.com/static/content/public/photo/2014/08/21/0ap3000000381608.pdf"" target=""_blank"">the NFL has done</a>) is one thing. Actually getting all players to follow it — when they specifically have short-term incentives not to — is another.</p> \n<p><span>One possible solution, mentioned by the researchers, is the use of in-helmet sensors to measure the impact of hits. If that sort of objective number was automatically gathered and sent to trainers, it could make it easier for them to be aware of all concussions and ensure that players don't return to play prematurely.</span></p> \n<p><b>Read more</b>: <a style=""line-height: 1.5;"" href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/9/5/6106851/nfl-football-concussions"" target=""_blank"">Here's what we know about football, concussions, and the brain</a></p> \n<p><!-- CHORUS_VIDEO_EMBED ChorusVideo:54746 --></p> \n<p> </p> \n<p class=""caption"">The NFL's concussion crisis, explained</p>",Sports

Even a single season of high school football might have harmful impacts on the brain,http://www.vox.com/2014/12/2/7316283/football-high-school-concussions, ,"<p>At this point, it's well-known that years of playing football can <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/9/5/6106851/nfl-football-concussions"">cause long-term mental problems</a>. It's also strongly suspected that this is true for players who merely suffer routine blows to the head — and are never even diagnosed with a concussion.</p> \n<p><q class=""right"" aria-hidden=""true"">Brain damage might occur even more quickly than many feared</q></p> \n<p>But <a href=""http://rsna2014.rsna.org/program/details/?emID=14011727"">new research</a>, presented yesterday by Wake Forest scientists at the annual meeting of the Radiological Society of North America, suggests that the damage can occur even more quickly than many people feared.</p> \n<p>Their analysis of 24 high- school football players found a correlation between the number of hits each player took in a season and changes in the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corpus_callosum"">corpus callosum</a> and other areas of the brain <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21864134"">known to be affected by concussions</a>.</p> \n<p>Now, the researchers didn't link these changes in the brain to actual behavioral changes, and they don't know for sure they were caused by football — they found a correlation, not a causation. Still, it's a disturbing finding given the mounting pile of evidence that football causes brain damage on a scale much larger than we realized.</p> \n<h3>What the researchers found</h3> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2508262/149635039.0.jpg"" alt=""high school football 2"" data-chorus-asset-id=""2508262""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">A high school game in Virginia. (John McDonnell/The Washington Post via Getty Images)</p> \n<p>The researchers worked with something called the <a href=""http://fmri.wfubmc.edu/research/KIDS"">Kinematics of Impact Data Set</a> (KIDS). In essence, it involves putting accelerometers in football helmets that measure the frequency and severity of hits, then letting youth players wear the helmets over the course of a season or more.</p> \n<p>The researchers used this data for 24 high-school players between the ages of 16 and 18. These players also underwent <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion_MRI"">diffusion MRI</a> scans before and after the season, which allows doctors to see how fluids move through the neurons in their brains' white matter, potentially revealing any abnormalities in the tissue.</p> \n<p><q class=""right"" aria-hidden=""true"">the ""heavy hitters"" showed higher levels of changes in their brains</q></p> \n<p>Using the accelerometer data, the researchers split the players into two groups: 9 of them were so-called ""heavy hitters,"" who took many blows to the head, and 15 were ""light hitters,"" and took fewer. None were diagnosed with a concussion during the season.</p> \n<p>All of these players showed changes in their brains' white matter that the researchers called ""<a href=""http://time.com/3611146/football-head-impacts-can-cause-brain-changes-even-without-concussion/"">concerning</a>"" — and the heavy hitters showed significantly higher levels of these changes than the light ones. The changes were disproportionately found in the corpus callosum and other areas deep in the white matter (which lies below the grey matter at the outer surface of the brain), which previous research has found to be frequently affected by concussions.</p> \n<p>Again, as far as we know, the players didn't demonstrate any symptoms during the season and the researchers didn't establish any link with actual brain problems. They see this as an initial step in researching the effects of football on young brains. But seen in the light of other things we've recently learned about head trauma, these findings are rather concerning.</p> \n<h3>What we know about football and the brain</h3> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/681268/136032391.0.jpg"" alt=""ann mckee"" data-chorus-asset-id=""681268""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Ann McKee, one of the leading neurologists looking into CTE, examines a brain at Boston University's brain bank.

5 things I never knew about the Super Bowl until I played in it,http://www.vox.com/2015/1/31/7948313/super-bowl-players,An NFL Hall of Famer reflects.,"<div class=""chorus-snippet center""> \n<p><em>Mike Haynes, one of the best cornerbacks in NFL history, starred in Super Bowl XVIII: a 38-9 rout of the Washington Redskins by his Los Angeles Raiders. He is currently a spokesman for the NFL's</em><i> <a href=""http://www.knowyourstats.org/"" target=""_blank"">Know Your Stats</a></i><em> campaign, a partnership with the Urology Care Foundation to raise awareness of prostate cancer. He still looks back on the Super Bowl as one of the high points of his NFL career — and says there's a lot about the game that you don't learn until you get there. He recently shared his thoughts with Joseph Stromberg.</em></p> \n<h3>1) The week before the Super Bowl is truly insane</h3> \n<p>It's completely different from the week leading up to a regular season game. There are so many reporters everywhere, and even though coaches try to keep you away from them apart from media day, you're still very aware of it.</p> \n<p>This was true even back when I played. But nowadays, the size of the media is probably 10 times what it was then. There are <a href=""https://azsuperbowl.com/media/"">more than 5,000 media</a> members at the Super Bowl this year.</p> \n<p>The other thing that makes it different is the huge number of people who come out of the woodwork leading up to the game. So many friends and family members and people I grew up with were calling, asking for tickets. And I was really fortunate that the Super Bowl was in Tampa — if it'd been in Arizona, where I went to college, or California, where I'm from, it would have been even crazier.</p> \n<p>I didn't know better, so at first I personally tried to handle it, and it was a bit of a distraction. Then a week before the game, I started telling people that I wasn't doing any of it — I needed to focus.</p> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""3359930"" alt=""mike haynes"" src=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3359930/98885533.0.jpg""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Haynes starred for the Raiders in Super Bowl XVIII. (Focus on Sport/Getty Images)</p> \n<h3>2) But coaches try really hard to treat it like a normal game</h3> \n<p>We tried to prepare for it just like any other game, which is a huge challenge. If you look at it as the biggest game of your life — which it is — you're putting pressure on yourself, and most people do not perform well under pressure. So the secret is trying to make it just another game.</p> \n<p>I vividly remember our last practice we were going to have before the game. Our coach, Tom Flores, pulled the whole team together like he did at the end of every Saturday practice, and I expected him to give a big, dramatic speech: ""Tomorrow is one of the greatest days of your life, we worked so hard to get here,"" that kind of thing.</p> \n<p>Instead, he said, ""Guys, this is just another big game. We've played in a lot of big games this year. I'll see you at the hotel at 6."" That's it.</p> \n<h3>3) The game itself feels really, really long</h3> \n<p>For the most part, the game itself is pretty normal, not too different from other games. You have your preparation routine before the game, and then there's a start time, and that part is all standard.</p> \n<p>But the thing that's really different is how long the halftime is. In the regular season, it's 12 minutes — just enough time to run into the locker room, talk to your coaches for a minute, maybe go to the bathroom, and run back out. But in the Super Bowl, it's about a half-hour, which really changes things.</p> \n<p>Then the post-game stuff goes on forever too. Normally you run off the field, shower up, get dressed, and go home. After the Super Bowl, there's a big trophy celebration, cameras in your locker room, everyone's asking you for an interview — it's total chaos.</p> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3359940/460833980.0.jpg"" alt=""raiders super bowl"" data-chorus-asset-id=""3359940""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Raiders coach Tom Flores is carried off the field after Super Bowl XVIII. (Focus on Sport/Getty Images)</p> \n<h3>4) The feeling of winning is overwhelming</h3> \n<p>We won 38-9, so well before it was over we realized we were about to win. And there is nothing like that feeling. It's something you accomplished that year that no one else accomplished. I wouldn't quite say it's life-changing, but it's close.</p> \n<p>Everyone's trying to win the Super Bowl. Teams are making financial investments, and players are making physical investments with their bodies. But very few people get to say they've won it. It's something very, very special.</p> \n<h3>5) It's very hard to realize you might never be back</h3> \n<p>I won the Super Bowl at age 30, and I'd been in the league for eight years by that point. But it was still hard to appreciate how rare that opportunity was. And I never got back.</p> \n<p>If I were to talk to the guys playing this year, I'd tell them that what's about to happen is incredibly special and may not happen again. Enjoy it. Do not take it for granted.</p> \n \n<script type=""text/javascript"" src=""http://ea.vox-cdn.com/production/sbnation-super-bowl-50-coverage/javascripts/pym-5ae91d75.js""></script> \n<script type=""text/javascript""><!-- \n  new pym.Parent('super-bowl-50-coverage__graphic-super-bowl-widget', '//apps.voxmedia.com/sbnation/super-bowl-50-coverage/vox/'); \n// --></script> \n<!--  ########  BEGIN SNIPPET  ########  --> \n<div class=""chorus-snippet credits""> \n<hr> \n<div class=""credits-content""> \n<div>Lead image: Timothy A.

Shortly after the announcement, Blatter was said to have boarded his private plane to fly to Saudi Arabia, which had quietly granted him asylum.</p> \n<p>""The people demand the downfall of the regime,"" flag-waving young soccer fans could be heard shouting in the streets after days of clashes with FIFA security forces.</p> \n<p>The news came when FIFA's shadowy executive committee seized state TV, announcing that Blatter had resigned. The short broadcast stated that the 10-member committee would ""safeguard FIFA on behalf of the people"" until elections for a replacement could be held. A date for elections was not set.</p> \n<p>Washington-based think tanks warned that Islamists could fill the void left by Blatter's resignation.</p> \n<p>""Blatter, for all his faults, was an important friend of the United States in combating soccer extremists,"" cautioned one analyst.

But until the Pacifics' two-game experiment with the RoboUmp, they had only been used for broadcast graphics and analytics, rather than for making official rulings.</span></p> \n<p>Baseball traditionalists might cringe at the idea of this technology ever reaching the major leagues. But it's a better way of calling balls and strikes — and in a sport where a few inches can be the difference between a win and a loss, there's no reason to retain inaccuracy solely for tradition's sake.</p> \n<h3>How the robot umpire works</h3> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3918334/Screen_Shot_2015-07-29_at_3.16.42_PM.0.png"" alt=""pitchf/x"" data-chorus-asset-id=""3918334""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">(<a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.sportvision.com/media/pitchfx-how-it-works"">Sportvision</a>)</p> \n<p>PITCHf/x uses three cameras — one in center field and two mounted on the grandstand — to track each pitch. Each camera captures about 30 images of the ball from the time it leaves the pitcher's hand to the time it's caught, and a computer analyzes this data to determine its path, speed, and location <span>as it crosses home plate</span><span>.</span></p> \n<p>Deciding whether a pitch crosses vertically over the plate is relatively simple, because the location of home plate doesn't change. An operator calibrates the system so that its strike zone matches the width of the plate, and currently it's recalibrated <a href=""http://grantland.com/features/ben-lindbergh-possibility-machines-replacing-umpires/"">several times per season in each MLB stadium</a>, before opening day and whenever data indicates it needs adjustment.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""right"">Three cameras track the path, speed, and location of each pitch</q></p> \n<p>But determining whether the pitch passed between a batter's shoulders and his knees — the <a href=""http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/official_info/umpires/rules_interest.jsp"">MLB's official definition of the strike zone</a> — is a bit trickier, because the zone changes from batter to batter. Currently, PITCHf/x relies on human auditors who watch previous film of each batter and code exactly where his strike zone is. The system then loads this data when he comes to the plate.</p> \n<p>A human operator at the center-field camera watches the system throughout the game to make sure it's calibrated correctly, and he or she has the ability to tweak each batter's defined strike zone, if needed. But PITCHf/x's improving software models mean this is rarely necessary. ""We’ve gotten to the point where we really change them very, very little, because even though batters will change their stance somewhat, the process we have for maintaining them is very sound,"" <a href=""http://grantland.com/features/ben-lindbergh-possibility-machines-replacing-umpires/"">Cory Schwartz of Major League Baseball Advanced Media told Grantland</a> in 2013.</p> \n<p>At the Pacifics game in San Rafael, for the first time, the computer's calls were made official. Specifically, they were passed off to a human (former player and PITCHf/x advocate Eric Byrnes) who called ""ball"" or ""strike"" in an umpire's characteristic bark — and the players generally approved of the system's decisions.</p> \n<h3>This computer ump is more accurate than a human</h3> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3918348/imagerollover_PFX_1.0.jpg"" alt=""pitchf/x"" data-chorus-asset-id=""3918348""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">(<a href=""https://www.sportvision.com/"">Sportvision</a>)</p> \n<p>A <a href=""http://baseball.physics.illinois.edu/MCAnalysis.pdf"">study by physics professor Alan Nathan</a> found that PITCHf/x accurately locates a pitch to within an inch. The MLB implicitly endorses its accuracy by using it to grade its umpires after each game.</p> \n<p>And when doing so, they've found that umpires overall have a <a href=""http://m.mlb.com/news/article/37468304/"">95 percent success rate</a> in calling strikes and balls: a pretty high figure, but one that still means that roughly<strong> </strong>eight pitches per game are called incorrectly. As it turns out, it's pretty hard for a human to track a 3-inch ball coming at him at 100 miles per hour and accurately decide if it nicked the corner of the plate.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""right"">The system is accurate to within an inch</q></p> \n<p>Of course, adopting an entirely new system means that entirely new sorts of errors can pop up. Occasionally, PITCHf/x can completely fail to register a pitch, sometimes due to poor lighting (<a href=""http://grantland.com/features/ben-lindbergh-possibility-machines-replacing-umpires/"">Schwartz told Grantland</a> that this occurred on 892 of 709,917 pitches thrown during the 2013 season). And meanwhile, on two at-bats, human operators incorrectly calibrated the system, leading to the possibility that absurdly high pitches — thrown at the level of the batter's head — could have been called strikes.</p> \n<p>Still, these sorts of problems can be corrected as PITCHf/x is used, and it's improved substantially since the 2013 season. Most of those missed pitches, for instance, occurred during a handful of games in which the system was installed incorrectly.</p> \n<h3>Why many traditionalists oppose this technology — and why they're wrong</h3> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3918366/GettyImages-480528580.0.jpg"" alt=""batter"" data-chorus-asset-id=""3918366""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">(Justin Edmonds/Getty Images)</p> \n<p>When asked by a batter if a pitch was a ball or a strike, legendary umpire Bill Klem  <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/davidsturt/2013/12/06/sonny-it-aint-nothin-til-i-call-it/"">once famously declared</a>, ""Sonny, it ain’t nothin’ till I call it."" This ambiguous definition of the strike zone — that it's a decision made inside the mind of the umpire, rather than a physical location above the plate — still rules in the minds of many traditionalists.</p> \n<p>They believe that the strike zone is a mutable area, varying based on the game situation, the particular umpire, the handedness of the pitcher, and even the <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://grantland.com/features/studying-art-pitch-framing-catchers-such-francisco-cervelli-chris-stewart-jose-molina-others/"">performance of the catcher</a> in positioning his glove and body to make it <i>look</i> like he caught the ball behind the plate. Transforming it into a strictly defined, consistent zone, they argue, would strip away a key element of baseball.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""right"">Already, the strike zone varies far less than it used to</q></p> \n<p>The idea that these arbitrary factors, entirely absent from the rule book, are a good thing to base calls on is part of baseball's deeper obsession with tradition, one that's greater than in any other American sport. Only last year did they begin allowing managers to challenge calls using instant replay — and balls or strikes still can't be reviewed.</p> \n<p><span>The same type of thinking holds that human umpires should arbitrarily change the strike zone because they've always arbitrarily changed the strike zone.</span><span> </span><span>PITCHf/x faces the huge obstacle of nostalgia before it might ever be implemented.</span></p> \n<p>But what its opponents rarely consider is that technologies like PITCHf/x have already transformed baseball. Starting in 2002, the MLB used an older system called QuesTec to evaluate umpires' performance after each game and see how consistently they called balls and strikes; in 2009, it was replaced by PITCHf/x. Through use of this data, grades, and other incentives, the league has pushed umps to standardize their strike zones, and studies find the variance between different umpires' calls <a href=""http://www.hardballtimes.com/the-outside-corner/"">narrowed by more than 25 percent</a> by 2008. For years, MLB has been trying to standardize the strike zone — and as a result, it isn't nearly as variable as it used to be.</p> \n<p>There's no reason PITCHf/x shouldn't be employed in real time to further close this gap. It wouldn't eliminate the home plate umpire: he'd still be there to call foul balls, checked swings, balks, and other facets of the game.

The NFL's hypocritical stance on fantasy football and gambling,http://www.vox.com/2015/8/25/9201183/fantasy-football-gambling-nfl,The league says gambling damages the integrity of the game. But what about daily fantasy?,"<p>The NFL says it strongly opposes gambling. In the past year alone, the league successfully <a href=""http://espn.go.com/chalk/story/_/id/11916951/us-district-judge-rules-sports-betting-new-jersey"">sued the state of New Jersey</a> to prevent it from legalizing sports betting, and <a href=""http://www.sbnation.com/2015/6/9/8753877/tony-romo-fantasy-football-convention-canceled-stupid-nfl"">forced Tony Romo and several other players</a> to cancel their appearances at a Las Vegas conference because it was held at a convention center owned by a casino.</p> \n<p>The irony, though, is that the conference was about <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/8/15/6003131/fantasy-football-how-to-play-draft-rankings"">fantasy football</a>: an ultra-popular game that involves wagering real money based on what occurs on the football field. Some legal scholars argue that fantasy is gambling, but the NFL actively promotes it —  its problem with Romo's conference was the locale.</p> \n<p><!--  ########  BEGIN SNIPPET  ########  --></p> \n<div class=""chorus-snippet s-related"" data-analytics-action=""link:related"" data-analytics-category=""article"">\n<span class=""s-related__title"">Related</span> <!-- Add links here --><a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/8/15/6003131/fantasy-football-how-to-play-draft-rankings"">Fantasy football, explained for non-football fans</a><br><!-- End links -->\n</div> \n<!--  ########  END SNIPPET  ########  --> \n<p><span>Nearly a decade ago, the NFL — along with other pro sports leagues — carefully </span><a href=""http://www.nyujlpp.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Boikess-The-Unlawful-Internet-Gambling.pdf"">carved out an exception for fantasy sports</a><span> in a congressional anti-gambling law.

But as <a href=""http://www.sbnation.com/fantasy-football-advice-fanduel"">daily fantasy sports</a> explode in popularity and blur the line between fantasy and gambling, the league's position is becoming less and less tenable.</p> \n<h3>How the NFL learned to stop worrying and love fantasy football</h3> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3998280/GettyImages-84461659.0.jpg"" alt=""Paul Tagliabue"" data-chorus-asset-id=""3998280""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Former NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue, in 1990. (Rogers Photo Archive/Getty Images)</p> \n<p>Even though several of the NFL's founding owners had <a href=""http://www.post-gazette.com/sports/steelers/2008/07/10/Professional-football-has-longtime-gambling-ties/stories/200807100256"">made their fortunes</a> through gambling-related activities, the league opposed it nearly from the start, largely because of the fear that it could lead to match-fixing. In the '40s and '60s, it <a href=""http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB124511421029417367"">suspended several players</a> for betting on games, and in 1976 it unsuccessfully <a href=""http://espn.go.com/chalk/story/_/id/13308895/behind-nfl-anti-gambling-stance-espn-chalk"">sued the state of Delaware</a> to block the state's sports lottery.</p> \n<p>Afraid of such activities spreading from state to state, in 1992, then-NFLCommissioner Paul Tagliabue successfully lobbied Congress to pass a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_and_Amateur_Sports_Protection_Act_of_1992"">law</a> that prohibited gambling on sports anywhere that it hadn't already been legalized. ""It is a matter of integrity,"" <a href=""https://sports.vice.com/en_us/article/the-shield-stands-alone-why-does-the-nfl-hate-sports-gambling"">Tagliabue said at the time</a>. ""It is a matter of the character of our games, of the character of our fans, and a matter of values.""</p> \n<p>Over the next decade, though, something new came along: fantasy sports.</p> \n<p><q class=""right"" aria-hidden=""true"">An NFL survey found that fantasy players watched nearly two more hours of football per week</q></p> \n<p>The basic idea — assembling imaginary teams of players that compete on the basis of their individual real statistics over the course of a whole season — was <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantasy_sport#History"">first developed</a> in the '50s, and for decades, fantasy baseball was the most commonly played. But fantasy football's popularity exploded once computers allowed for automatic stat tracking, and especially after 1999, when Yahoo became the first major site to host leagues for free.</p> \n<p>One might have expected the NFL to try to stamp out fantasy. But for whatever reason — perhaps because it didn't share the historical association with organized crime, or maybe because it seemingly appealed to a different group of players — the league did the opposite.</p> \n<p>In 2000, it began <a href=""http://web.archive.org/web/20001018062859/http://www.nfl.com/index3.html"">hosting leagues on NFL.com</a> and promoting fantasy in commercials. One reason was obvious: Fantasy made people watch a lot more football.</p> \n<p>As early as 2002, an <a href=""http://www.sportsbusinessdaily.com/Journal/Issues/2002/09/20020909/This-Weeks-Issue/Survey-Results-Push-Nflcom-To-Increase-Fantasy-Content.aspx?hl=Entry%20Media%20Inc&amp;sc=0"">NFL-commissioned survey found</a> that male fantasy players watched 8.4 hours of football per week, compared with 6.6 hours for average male fans. ""This is the first time we've been able to demonstrate specifically that fantasy play drives TV viewing,"" Chris Russo, an NFL executive, said at the time.</p> \n<h3>The lobbying that ensured fantasy football stayed legal</h3> \n<p>Even after the NFL began promoting fantasy, its stance against gambling on the outcome of games remained as rigid as ever. In 2005, for instance, it <a href=""http://www.hotelchatter.com/story/2005/2/15/81910/1021/hotels/See_The_NFL_Blocked_Wynn_Super_Bowl_Ad"">blocked a Super Bowl ad</a> for a Las Vegas casino and <a href=""http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB124511421029417367"">banned networks broadcasting games</a> from picking point spread winners, which could promote betting on games.</p> \n<p>The next year, though, as Congress debated what would become <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unlawful_Internet_Gambling_Enforcement_Act_of_2006"">UIGEA</a> — the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act, which was primarily intended to shut down poker sites and other sorts of online gambling — the NFL and other pro leagues <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/04/washington/04gambling.html"">arrived to lobby</a> them with an interesting request. They supported the bill, but <a href=""http://www.nyujlpp.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Boikess-The-Unlawful-Internet-Gambling.pdf"">believed that fantasy games should be given an exemption</a>.</p> \n<p>The bill originally <a href=""http://thinkprogress.org/sports/2015/05/07/3648832/daily-fantasy-sports-gambling/"">had no such exemption</a>. But due to pressure from a number of House members, its primary author — Iowa Rep. Jim Leach — agreed to stick in what became known as the <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/07/11/AR2006071100084.html"">""fantasy carve-out.""</a> It specifies that the law allows <a href=""http://harvardjsel.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/1-54.pdf"">""fantasy sports games""</a> as long as they meet three criteria:</p> \n<ul> \n<li>Prizes can't be determined based upon the number of participants or the size of their entry fees.</li> \n<li>The leagues must be skill-based, rather than based on random chance.</li> \n<li>The outcome can't be based on the score or stats of an individual athlete in a single event.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>These criteria might seem random, but they were intended to finely distinguish between what are ultimately two very similar activities: gambling and fantasy. The <a href=""http://www.gambling-law-us.com/Articles-Notes/online-poker-skill.htm"">skill versus chance distinction</a> has been used in several other anti-gambling laws, while the third requirement effectively banned betting on a player's performance in a single game.</p> \n<p>Of course, by making an exception for fantasy games, the law didn't actually legalize them; it just left their status to be determined by state laws and other federal statutes. But while <a href=""http://harvardjsel.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/1-54.pdf"">scholars debate the legality</a> of fantasy from state to state, the UIGEA exemption has effectively ensured that the many websites that host fantasy leagues don't actually get prosecuted.</p> \n<h3>Fantasy football makes the NFL a ton of money</h3> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""3998256"" alt=""fantasy football ad"" src=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3998256/fantasymobilecp2013.0.jpg""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">(NFL.com)</p> \n<p>The carve-out has proven hugely beneficial for all pro leagues — but most of all for the NFL.</p> \n<p>About <a href=""http://qz.com/298042/the-bizarre-multi-billion-dollar-industry-of-american-fantasy-sports/"">30 million people</a> play fantasy football, more than any other fantasy sport, and in 2014 they spent an estimated <a href=""http://www.adweek.com/news/technology/nfl-wants-piece-11-billion-fantasy-football-market-159374"">$11 billion</a> on it. The NFL doesn't collect this money directly, but it profits from the countless extra hours of football people watch to follow the members of their fantasy teams.</p> \n<p>A <a href=""http://quod.lib.umich.edu/j/jsas/6776111.0003.114/--relationship-of-fantasy-football-participation-with-nfl?rgn=main;view=fulltext"">2011 study</a> by Fordham professor <a href=""http://www.fordham.edu/info/22941/full-time_faculty/4720/john_a_fortunato"">John Fortunato</a> found that games featuring more fantasy-relevant players tend to get higher TV ratings, regardless of the team's winning percentages. Fantasy makes people stay tuned for the otherwise meaningless final minutes of blowouts and gets them to watch boring matchups between terrible teams.</p> \n<p>The NFL knows all this. It's why its broadcasts are awash in stats and why it produces <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFL_Network#NFL_RedZone_Channel"">a hugely popular channel</a> that simply bounces live from touchdown to touchdown instead of showing a complete game. Within a decade, fantasy has thoroughly permeated football culture, going from a fringe hobby to the mainstream — and the NFL has ridden fantasy to new heights of profitability.</p> \n<h3>Daily fantasy blurs the line between fantasy and gambling</h3> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3998260/Screen_Shot_2015-08-25_at_9.10.37_AM.0.png"" alt=""daily fantasy screengrab"" data-chorus-asset-id=""3998260""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">NFL Network discusses daily fantasy strategy. (<a href=""http://www.nfl.com/videos/nfl-fantasy/0ap3000000448711/NFL-Fantasy-Live-Daily-fantasy-picks"">NFL.com</a>)</p> \n<p>The latest craze in fantasy is daily leagues, in which you draft a new set of players each week. (They're called ""daily"" because for other sports you pick a new team each day, but a set of football games is spread over a week.)</p> \n<p>The sites that run them — such as <a href=""https://www.fanduel.com/"">FanDuel</a> and <a href=""https://www.draftkings.com/dti"">DraftKings</a> — take in entry fees and pay out cash prizes. The rapid feedback of daily fantasy has led to explosive growth, and just a few years after their founding, the two sites are reportedly valued at <a href=""http://fortune.com/2015/04/06/draftkings-and-fanduel-close-in-on-massive-new-investments/"">$1.5 billion and $900 million</a>, respectively.</p> \n<p>But some say daily fantasy sounds a lot like gambling. Many <a href=""http://thinkprogress.org/sports/2015/05/07/3648832/daily-fantasy-sports-gambling/"">legal scholars allege</a> that these sites' games fail to meet several of the UIGEA's carve-out criteria: They clearly pay out prizes based on user entry fees and depend upon athletes' performances in single games. And as sports law professor <a href=""http://harvardjsel.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/1-54.pdf"">Marc Edelman notes</a>, basing the results on a much smaller number of games dramatically increases the influence of chance — and reduces the role of skill.</p> \n<p><q class=""right"" aria-hidden=""true"">""It's tough to make an intellectually honest distinction between the two""</q></p> \n<p>FanDuel and DraftKings, of course, constantly claim that they're ""100% legal,"" and there's no indication that law enforcement is planning to shut them down. Though the NFL hasn't formally partnered with either company — as <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/darrenheitner/2015/04/02/draftkings-and-major-league-baseball-extend-exclusive-partnership/"">Major League Baseball</a> and the <a href=""http://espn.go.com/nba/story/_/id/11864920/nba-fanduel-reach-4-year-exclusive-daily-fantasy-deal"">NBA</a> have — it implicitly endorses daily fantasy with <a href=""http://www.nfl.com/videos/nfl-fantasy/0ap3000000442291/NFL-Fantasy-Live-Daily-Fantasy-plays"">coverage and videos</a> on its website. (The league did not return requests for comments on its stance for this article.)</p> \n<p>But lots of observers point out that daily fantasy is erasing the UIGEA law's distinction between gambling and fantasy — and is making the NFL's position look increasingly hypocritical. ""On the spectrum of legality to illegality, they’re getting pretty close to the line,"" Florida State legal scholar <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/12/sports/web-sites-blur-line-between-fantasy-sports-and-gambling.html"">Ryan Rodenberg told the New York Times</a>. ""It’s tough to make an intellectually honest distinction between the two.""</p> \n<p>All this has put the NFL in an increasingly untenable position. The league aggressively combats gambling, ultimately due to the fear that it could lead to match-fixing and damage the integrity of the game. But the league has done little about the <a href=""http://mmqb.si.com/2014/07/28/monday-morning-qb-nfl-training-camps/4"">reports</a> of ""undue pressure some players and coaches feel from big-money fantasy-football players,"" and the NFL openly promotes the fact that <a href=""http://www.nfl.com/news/story/09000d5d8145ad3d/article/fantasy-football-isnt-just-for-fans-nfl-players-are-hooked-too"">many of its players play fantasy</a> themselves. Somehow, these aren't threats to football's integrity in the same way.</p> \n<p>In January, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell was asked why, and his answer was utterly incoherent. ""We don’t put fantasy football in that category at all,"" <a href=""http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2014/01/31/goodell-nfls-opposition-to-legalized-sports-gambling-isnt-changing/"">he said</a>. ""Fantasy has a way of people engaging more with football, and they do it in a fun, friendly, in this case, a family manner.""</p>",Sports
"Shaq's life advice to Kobe: ""Once it's done you can't get it back""",http://www.vox.com/2015/9/21/9366985/shaqs-life-advice-to-kobe-byrant,Bryant's facing retirement due to injury.,"<p>Famous <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116756/"">genie</a> Shaquille O'Neal gave Kobe Bryant poignant advice about pursuing once-in-a-lifetime opportunities after already achieving career and financial success. On Monday, the Times-Picayune’s <a href=""http://www.nola.com/pelicans/index.ssf/2015/09/shaquille_oneal_encourges_lake.html"">John Reid</a> shared what O'Neal said to Bryant, who is facing the end of his NBA career (h/t <a href=""http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/2015/9/21/9364523/Shaquille-ONeal-kobe-bryant-retire-la-lakers"">SB Nation</a>):</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>''If you still got something, you should go because once it's done you can't get it back,'' O'Neal said. ''If I hadn't got hurt I would have went on and played my last season to try and break Wilt Chamberlain's scoring record.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Chamberlain, who retired in 1973, still <a href=""http://www.nba.com/encyclopedia/wilts_records.html"">holds the most NBA records</a> except in a few areas, such as the most seasons leading the league in field goal percentages, a record of which he is tied with O'Neal. O'Neal himself <a href=""http://www.nba.com/2011/news/features/sekou_smith/06/04/shaq-goes-out-as-he-only-can/index.html#"">retired in 2011</a>. Bryant, now in his 20th season, is facing the end of his career due to injury — something O'Neal says shouldn't necessarily hold him back from continuing to play. The two played together for years, helping the Los Angeles Lakers win <a href=""http://www.nba.com/history/nba-season-recaps/index.html"">three consecutive championships</a> before falling out of each other's good graces.</p> \n<p>O'Neal's suggestion that ""If you still got something, you should go"" is a great reminder that opportunities don't often wait for us to make up our mind about them before they disappear. As for Bryant, he expressed a straight-forward <a href=""http://www.sbnation.com/nba/2015/8/4/9095557/kobe-bryant-retires-la-lakers"">perspective</a> about his plans back in August: ""Either I like playing the game and going through this process or I don't.""</p>",Sports

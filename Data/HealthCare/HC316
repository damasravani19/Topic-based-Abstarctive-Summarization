Babies born 3 miles apart in New York have a 9-year life expectancy gap
A baby born today in Murray Hill, a neighborhood in midtown Manhattan, has a life expectancy of 85 years. A baby born six subway stops north, in East Harlem, has a life expectancy of 76. That's a nine-year gap, within just a few miles. It shows up on this map, from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, meant to highlight the massive health-care gaps that exist within cities. ( ) RWJF, a health-care-focused nonprofit, mapped a few other cities on life expectancy, and the results are similar. There's a 16-year life expectancy gap within urban Chicago. ( ) In Richmond, Virginia, the differences are even more dramatic: a 20-year difference in life expectancy within five miles.

American potato lobby seeks desperately to understand millennials
First, a disclosure: potatoes are, without a doubt, my favorite food. If I had to be stranded on a desert island with one food, it would be potatoes for a set of reasons friends have heard me enumerate far too many times. The report has some informative albeit difficult to read charts about what millennials value in potatoes. Millennials don't think potatoes are exotic or indulgent. Millennials do think potatoes are cheap. Millennials, it seems, think the same things about potatoes that everyone else in this country does.   
 The potato board thinks there are five types of millennials, each of which can be represented by a type of potato.   
 The upshot of the different categories seems to be: some millennials like to try new things. Other millennials don't. Some cook for fun! Some just cook to put food on the table. "Not all millennials," as the first graph reminds us, "think or act the same." Anyway, the Potato Board's plan is this: go after the entertainers and explorers, populations that skew towards Northeastern parts of the country, and convince them that potatoes are hip. You've been warned, youths of Northeast corridor: big potato is coming for you. Get our newsletter in your inbox twice a week.

Republican governors have found something they like about Obamacare
As governor, Pence had the final say on whether his state expands Medicaid to 350,000 Hoosiers — and he wasn't shy about using that leverage with the Obama administration. Pence demanded that, if he were to sign onto the Medicaid expansion, it would only happen if he could use Indiana's controversial,   as a vehicle. Pence  that he would endorse the Medicaid expansion, becoming the 10th Republican governor to sign onto the program. He joined the growing ranks of state officials using their sway over a key White House priority to extract significant concessions in how Medicaid works. "The administration is working very hard to come to agreement with Republican governors where they can," says Tevi Troy, president of the American Health Policy Institute and a former Health and Human Services official in the Bush administration. "Because they want people to sign up for the expansion, particularly a high profile governor like Pence, they're working pretty hard to make compromises." In giving states this flexibility, there's a tension for the Obama administration: it wants to maintain Medicaid as a safety-net program, with a robust set of benefits, but also give states a chance to experiment with new approaches.

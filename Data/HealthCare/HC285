How much Americans sleep, in one map
Jawbone manufactures fitness trackers that thousands of Americans wear to bed each night, to track how much sleep they're getting. That lets them create this map of where Americans get the most and the least sleep. ( ) Jawbone's data shows that, on average, no major American city gets the National Institute of Health recommended seven hours of nightly sleep. You see that in the light green areas above, which tend to surround large populations. Jawbone also put together a map of when people go to sleep. And there you see mostly people who live in large cities and college towns staying up later. That shows that people in Brooklyn, NY tend to have the latest bed time in the United States (they turn down, on average, at 12:07 a.m.) where as people living in Maui, Hawaii get to bed the earliest at 10:31 p.m.     ( ) While Brooklynites do stay up late for the United States, shows they pale in comparison to urbanites in other major cities. In Moscow, the average Jawbone wearer goes to bed at 12:46 a.m. Get our newsletter in your inbox twice a week.

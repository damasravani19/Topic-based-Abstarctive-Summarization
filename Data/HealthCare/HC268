Missing paperwork means 115,000 enrollees will lose Obamacare
The government notices to 310,000 enrollees in mid-August, asking them to provide additional information to verify their citizenship status. While a majority of those people responded to the government, providing the necessary documents, 115,000 did not and are set to lose their coverage at the end of the month. The Affordable Care Act specifically bars undocumented workers from purchasing coverage through the exchanges, even if they wanted to purchase unsubsidized coverage and foot the entire bill themselves. Those who submit their documents after September 30 will qualify for a special enrollment period, where they can sign up for coverage to replace their terminated plan. The federal government will continue reaching out to this population. Get our newsletter in your inbox twice a week.

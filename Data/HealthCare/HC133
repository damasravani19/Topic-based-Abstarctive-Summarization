Diabetes is on the rise â€” and it's costing the US billions each year
Diabetes is on the rise in America, according to   from the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention. The CDC estimates that 29.1 million people, or 9.3 percent of the US population, had diabetes in 2012. That's up from 25.8 million, or 8.3 percent of the US population, in 2010. More than one-fourth of the cases are undiagnosed, which means 8.1 million people most likely don't know they have diabetes. The rise comes with a large financial burden for the US. The CDC projects the direct and indirect costs of diabetes total $245 billion, with $176 billion going to direct medical costs and the rest going to indirect costs like disability, work loss, and premature death. The problem is poised to get a lot worse, too. The CDC estimates that 37 percent of US adults aged 20 and  older, or about 86 million Americans, have prediabetes, when blood sugar  levels are alarmingly high but not quite high enough to be classified  as diabetes. This population is at a high risk for eventually developing  diabetes, although lifestyle changes can prevent the disease. Diabetes is caused when the body can't properly process blood sugar.

Both types lead to high blood sugar, which can then lead to serious conditions  like heart disease, stroke, blindness, kidney failure, and lower-limb  amputation. Diabetes can be dealt with in a few ways. Type 1 is managed by directly injecting or pumping the body with insulin, the hormone that helps manage blood sugar. Type 2 is usually treated by adhering to a healthier diet and increasing exercise. Younger people are much less likely to have diabetes. The CDC estimates, in fact, that more than one in four Americans 65 and older have the disease. Men also appear to be slightly more likely to develop diabetes. Racial and ethnic minorities also have much higher rates of the illness. The CDC's latest report offers no explanation for the rise. But, at least with type 2 diabetes, the rise of diabetes is linked to America's increasingly sedentary lifestyle. It's no coincidence that   is becoming a bigger problem as diabetes gets worse as well. Some experts have also fixated on added sugar in particular to explain America's struggles with obesity and diabetes. "The data says that the dose on average that is safe is six to nine  teaspoons of added sugar per day. Currently, Americans are at 22  teaspoons of added sugar per day," said Robert Lustig of the University of California,  San Francisco, in  . "That excess is driving obesity, diabetes, lipid problems, heart disease,  cancer, dementia, fatty liver disease — virtually every chronic  metabolic disease that you can think of is being driven by this excess  of sugar."    dispute Lustig's focus on sugar. They argue the problems with the American diet are much more complicated. People should, according to Lustig's critics, focus on improving their diets and reducing excess across the board, instead of demonizing one ingredient or food. Whatever the specific cause, everyone at least agrees on two changes that Americans could make to help prevent diabetes: eating healthier and exercising more often. : Added more context about how type 2 diabetes is developed.

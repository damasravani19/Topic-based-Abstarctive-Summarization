Fighting 'churn': The less-noticed way that Obamacare reduces the uninsured rate
Insurance status changes like this all of the time, a phenomenon known by health wonks as "churn". Between 2004 and 2005, for example, the insurance rate stayed roughly the same. But that also masks a change in health insurance status for lots and lots of people. About 10 million people became uninsured from 2004 to 2005, John A. Graves, a professor of health policy at Vanderbilt University,Â  "There was churn everywhere in the health system," says Larry Levitt, a vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation. "Some of that will still happen, but I think it will be minimized." This is a more subtle effect of Obamacare, and it'll take longer to suss out the full extent of the law's effect. "It's too early to know how successful the ACA is going to be at reducing churn, because it depends a lot on people's behavior," Levitt said. "But there's the potential to change the culture of health insurance. It's possible that once we get people into the insurance system, they'll be less likely to leave when their circumstances change." Get our newsletter in your inbox twice a week.

Obamacare's insurance expansion is working, in one chart
The new polling data suggests that both the health care law – and the recovering economy – are having a pretty significant effect on the number of Americans with insurance coverage.

There's been a 5.2 percentage-point drop in the uninsured rate, for Americans who have a household income lower than $36,000 since the end of 2013. Minorities and younger Americans have also seen steeper declines; the uninsured rate for African Americans has fallen by 7.7 percentage-points over the last four months.

Despite the facts, America has convinced itself Obamacare is a disaster
Most Americans don't think Obamacare hit its enrollment target, a new Kaiser Family Foundation poll  . This is an especially bizarre finding when you look at another question in the same poll of the same people. Researchers asked participants how many people signed up for coverage. Forty-three percent of them thought that 8 million people signed up for private insurance coverage during open enrollment. Another 9 percent think that 13 million signed up. Hamel says people who identified as Democrats were much more likely to estimate that Obamacare had met its enrollment target than those who were Republicans. But there was still lots of skepticism on both sides: 43 percent of Democrats and 71 percent of Republicans thought the health law had fallen short of the sign-up target. Most people agreed with the first idea, despite the fact that Healthcare.gov has functioned decently well since December. "News about the problems with the exchanges was on a lot longer than any discussion of beating the enrollment goal," Hamel says. "It's possible that all the reports were still in the forefront of people's minds." And its likely that most Americans are gauging their understanding of how well — or poorly — Obamacare is going from the news coverage. Most Americans already have health insurance, and aren't shopping on the exchanges for new policies. So even if the Obamacare experience improves, most people won't necessarily notice. "So many people are not impacted by the law that they're more likely to respond to messages in the media than they are to evaluate their own experience," Hamel says. "That makes me think it will be a while before there's any shift in how people think the law is going." Get our newsletter in your inbox twice a week.

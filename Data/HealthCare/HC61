Hawaiiâ€™s Obamacare exchange cost nearly $24,000 per enrollee
 state-run exchanges were better at   than the federal exchanges — and that success came with a higher price tag. The exchanges cost $7.4 billion in federal dollars to set up. About $3.9   billion of that went to 15 marketplaces run by states and the District of Columbia, which all spent a lot more on outreach per enrollee than  . Now,   of federal data from former Obama administration official Jay Angoff, now with law firm Mehri and Skalet, shows state-based exchanges spent more than twice as much per enrollee than the federal exchanges. It's worth noting, however, that this analysis only counts federal funding to federal and state-run exchanges, which misses private outreach groups that, in general, spent much more on states with federal exchanges than states with state-run exchanges. In some cases, the high price tag is a sign of a poorly run exchange. Hawaii's exchange, for example, both ran up costs and  . So part of the problem was Hawaii had few enrollees relative to its large budget. But even if the state had hit its enrollment projections, its cost per enrollee would still be in the thousands. Angoff's findings suggest that states like Hawaii, then, would be better off switching to the federal exchanges, if they can't get their costs under control.

Teens are shockingly great at using birth control
But over the past six decades, those two events have inched much closer together. And now, for women born in 1991, the median age for the first time having sex and first use of contraceptives are exactly the same: 17.8 years old. This creates a longer time span when women could have an unintended pregnancy. "The growing length of this period makes it vital that women have access to a wide range of effective methods of contraception" including long-acting, reversible contraceptives like IUDs, says study author Lawrence Finer. Data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that teens are most likely to use birth control pills and condoms as contraceptives.   from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists say teens should be offered IUDs as a first-line contraceptive because the implantable device tends to be most effective at preventing pregnancy. IUDs have typically been more expensive for patients than birth control (and especially more expensive than condoms). The health care law might change that: it requires all insurers to offer any contraceptives at no cost for patients. With some financial barriers removed, that could lead to increased use of IUDs in coming years. Get our newsletter in your inbox twice a week.

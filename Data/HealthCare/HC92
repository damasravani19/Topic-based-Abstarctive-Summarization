Thereâ€™s another scandal in American health care
The investigation is ongoing, but as of now, it looks like overwhelmed VA hospitals shunted some veterans onto secret wait lists and delayed their care (read Vox's explainer  ). The revelations are correctly being treated by both parties as a national scandal: denying Americans health care to which they're legally entitled doesn't simply inconvenience them. It can kill them. We don't know how many veterans were hurt by the VA's secret wait lists. The VA was aiming for waits of no more than 14 days for non-urgent appointments, but Timothy Noah   "an internal VA estimate" based on more reliable data that puts the average wait closer to 21 days. The investigation is likely to find hospitals where the average wait was much longer, and individual cases where the waits were truly appalling — and perhaps fatal. It's a relief to see so much outrage over poor access to government-provided health-care benefits. But it would be nice to see bipartisan outrage extend to another unfolding health-care scandal in this country: the 4.8 million people living under the poverty line who are eligible for Medicaid but won't get it because their state has refused Obamacare's Medicaid expansion. As appalling as the wait times are for VA care, the people living in states that refused the Medicaid expansion aren't just waiting too long for care. They're not getting it at all. They're going completely uninsured when federal law grants them comprehensive coverage. Many of these people will get sick and find they can't afford treatment and some of them will die. Many of the victims here, by the way, are also veterans. So here are 24 health-care scandals that critics of the VA should also be furious about:                         :  :  All in all, the Kaiser Family Foundation   that more than 7.5 million uninsured adults would be eligible for Medicaid but live in a state that has refused the expansion. Of that group, 4.8 million are too poor to be eligible for subsidies in Obamacare's insurance exchanges. So they're out of luck. The point here isn't to minimize the problems at the VA, which need to be fixed — and fast. But anyone who feels morally outraged over the extended wait times at the VA should be appalled by the literally endless wait times the poor are enduring in the states that are refusing to expand Medicaid.

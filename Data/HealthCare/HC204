Changing a pill's color has big health consequences
But what pills look like, a new study suggests, could actually matter a lot for whether patients even take their medication in the first place.   published in the  shows a strong relationship between patients halting their meds after being switched to a generic pill that worked exactly the same but looked a little different. Heart attack patients who quit taking their meds were 30 percent more likely to have had their pills change color or shape before they stopped. And that means "change in the shape or color of medications may contribute to patients' stopping treatment," the study authors write. That can be an expensive problem: when patients aren't complying with their medications, there can be a higher rate of complications or trips back to the hospital. One easy fix here would be to simply require all generics to look similar. Given that patients' seem to rely on the appearance of their medications to figure out if its the one they should take, why not make the drugs that do the same thing look the same, too? Under current law, there's really  between generic drug-makers on what their products look like; each one picks a color and a shape and ships the drug out to patients. It would likely take an intervention by a government agency, perhaps the Food and Drug Administration, to ensure that pills that do the same thing also look the same, too.

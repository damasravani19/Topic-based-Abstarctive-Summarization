Twenty-somethings report better health and lower medical expenses under Obamacare
The new rule did have significant financial effects, though: for the health care that 19- to 25-year olds   use, annual out-of-pocket health expenses — small to begin with — declined by 18 percent, on average. Compared to slightly older adults who can't stay on their parents' coverage, those aged 19 to 25 saw insurance coverage tick upward 7.2 percentage points after the under-26 rule kicked in. The probability of reporting excellent physical health climbed by 6.2 percentage points, and the probability of reporting excellent mental health went up by 4 percentage points. Here's the catch: insurance coverage didn't have a significant effect on how much health care young adults  . Even though young adults who benefited from the law report feeling better, that doesn't seem to be the result of showing up at the doctor anymore than they did before Obamacare. On its face, this isn't a terribly surprising finding: twenty-somethings tend to be a healthy bunch. Aside from an annual physical —   — most young adults probably don't need to visit the doctor very often. So how does the better-reported health care square with no increase in doctor visits? According to the authors, their findings suggest that, in the short run, "insurance may improve peace of mind and perceptions of health." Get our newsletter in your inbox twice a week.

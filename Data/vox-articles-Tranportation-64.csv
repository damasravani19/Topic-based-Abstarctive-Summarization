Here are the deadliest US cities for biking or walking,http://www.vox.com/2014/4/18/5621388/pedestrian-and-biker-deaths,The US has more biker and walker deaths than many European nations. And the worst offending cities aren't as obvious as you might think.,"<p><span>About 16% of people who die in traffic crashes in the US are bikers or pedestrians. According to the Department of Transportation, 4,743 pedestrians and 726  bikers were killed in 2012 (the most recent year it has </span><a href=""http://www-nrd.nhtsa.dot.gov/Pubs/811856.pdf"">data</a><span>). Here, in four charts, is an exploration of where the riskiest roads are for someone traveling under human power.</span></p> \n<h3>In the US, fewer pedestrians and bikers are dying</h3> \n<h3><img alt=""Deathsovertime"" class=""photo"" src=""http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/assets/4315981/DeathsOverTime.png""></h3> \n<h3>But the US is still deadlier than other countries</h3> \n<p><img alt=""Usavseurope"" class=""photo"" src=""http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/assets/4319473/USAvsEurope.deaths_2.png""><i>(I originally labeled this graph wrong as per 100 km. The correct figure is per 100 million km as now shown.)</i></p> \n<h3>Phoenix and Fresno are the worst for bikers</h3> \n<p><img alt=""Bikerdeathsincities"" class=""photo"" src=""http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/assets/4315997/BikerDeathsInCities.png"">Above are five cities with the highest biker death rate per capita (out of a data set of 52 large cities) along with the rates of the five largest cities in the US. When adjusted for city size, Phoenix and Mesa, AZ, Fresno, Jacksonville, and New Orleans come out on top as the riskiest places to bike.</p> \n<h3>Detroit and Miami are the worst for pedestrians</h3> \n<p><img alt=""Pedestriandeathsincities"" class=""photo"" src=""http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/assets/4316005/PedestrianDeathsInCities.png""><span>After adjusting for city size, I charted the five cities with the highest rate of pedestrian deaths (out of a data set of 52 large cities) as well as the five largest cities in the US. The highest fatality risk from walking ends up being in Detroit, Miami, Atlanta, Tucson, and Sacramento.</span></p> \n<p><b>Update: </b>The raw data for the above two graphs is from the DOT and Census Bureau, as provided to me by the <a href=""http://bikewalkalliance.org/index.php"">Alliance for Biking &amp; Walking</a>, a coalition of biking and walking advocacy organizations. The analysis itself is mine. <br><br>There are many difficulties when trying to account for variations in the amount of biking and walking going on in these cities. For example, there's no consistent data set across cities of miles biked or walked, which would likely be the ideal way to calculate risk.</p> \n<p>Many doing this type of analysis, including the Alliance for Biking &amp; Walking, prefer to look at the rate of fatalities per the total number of biking or walking commuters (available city by city through the Census Bureau), rather than total residents. But note that this method doesn't take recreational use into account. ""This method of calculating risk is somewhat limited due to its reliance on commuter mode share, which is used as a relative measure of overall bicycling and walking,"" the Alliance noted in its recent 2014 Benchmarking Report, which you can download <a href=""http://bikewalkalliance.org/resources/benchmarking"">here</a>.</p> \n<p>Andrea J. Milne, <span>Benchmarking Project Manager for the </span><span>Alliance for Biking &amp; Walking, explained their reasoning to me in an email: </span><span>""The calculation we used was on strong recommendation from our two academic research consultants (John Pucher and Ralph Buehler) as it is in-line with what they and other researchers use in their own research. We realize that commuters don't fully represent all bicyclists and pedestrians, but we are going with the assumption that where people feel more comfortable biking/walking to work, they likely feel more comfortable biking/walking for other purposes as well.""</span></p> \n<p>Here's the results of their analysis, as presented in their recent <a href=""http://bikewalkalliance.org/resources/benchmarking"">report</a>.

Why cyclists should be able to roll through stop signs and ride through red lights,http://www.vox.com/2014/5/9/5691098/why-cyclists-should-be-able-to-roll-through-stop-signs-and-ride,Idaho already lets cyclists do this. Research and common sense say that their law should go nationwide.,"<p>If you've looked around <span>a city lately, you might've noticed that many cyclists don't obey some traffic laws. They roll through stop signs, instead of coming to a complete stop, and brazenly ride through red lights if there aren't any cars coming.</span></p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""right"">research and common sense say slowly rolling through a stop sign on a bike shouldn't be illegal</q></p> \n<p><span>Cyclists reading this might be nodding guiltily in recognition of their own behavior. Drivers might be angrily remembering the last biker they saw flout the law, wondering when traffic police will finally crack down and assign some tickets.</span></p> \n<p><span></span>But the cyclists are probably in the right here. While it's obviously reckless for them to blow through an intersection when they don't have the right of way, research and<span> common sense say that slowly rolling through a stop sign on a bike shouldn't be illegal in the first place.</span></p> \n<p>Some places in the US already allow cyclists to treat stop signs as yields, and red lights as stop signs, and these rules are no more dangerous — and perhaps even a little safer — than the status quo.</p> \n<h3>This is called the ""Idaho stop""</h3> \n<p>There are already a few places in the US that allow cyclists some flexibility in dealing with stop signs and red lights. Idaho has permitted it since 1982, which is why this behavior is<span> known as the </span><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idaho_stop"" target=""_blank"" style=""background-color: #ffffff; line-height: 1.5;"">Idaho stop</a><span>.</span></p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""right"">Idaho's rule is pretty straightforward: for bikers, a stop sign is a yield</q></p> \n<p>Idaho's rule is pretty straightforward. If a cyclist approaches a stop sign, he or she needs to slow down and look for traffic. If there's already a pedestrian, car, or another bike there, then the other vehicle has the right of way. If there's no traffic, however, the cyclist can slowly proceed. Basically, for bikers, a stop sign is a yield sign.</p> \n<p>If a cyclist approaches a red light, meanwhile, he or she needs to stop fully. Again, if there's any oncoming traffic or a pedestrian, it has the right of way. If there's not, the cyclist can proceed cautiously through the intersection. Put simply, red light is a stop sign.</p> \n<p>This <i>doesn't</i> mean that a cyclist is allowed to blast through an intersection at full speed — which is dangerous for pedestrians, the cyclist, and pretty much everyone involved. This isn't allowed in Idaho, and it's a terrible idea everywhere.</p> \n<p>This video, <span>produced when Oregon was considering a similar law in 2009,</span><span> has some nice visualizations of the Idaho stop at around one minute in:</span></p> \n<center><iframe frameborder=""0"" height=""402"" width=""700"" src=""//player.vimeo.com/video/4140910?portrait=0""></iframe></center> \n<p> </p> \n<p><span>Apart from Idaho, this is the law in a few Colorado cities (Dillon, Breckenridge, and Aspen).</span></p> \n<p><span> </span><a target=""_blank"" href=""http://bikeleague.org/sites/default/files/idahostop_edit-1.pdf"">Several states</a> have similar ""<span>Dead Red"" laws, which </span><span>lets cyclists (and motorcyclists) ride through a red light </span><span>if there's no traffic, if the cyclists have stopped for set periods of time, and if the light isn't changing because its sensor doesn't register bikes</span><span>. </span></p> \n<p><span>Proposals to allow the Idaho stop have been proposed in a few other states, but they haven't been approved.</span></p> \n<p><img src=""http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/assets/4441681/Screen_Shot_2014-05-12_at_1.27.01_PM.png"" class=""photo"" alt=""Screen_shot_2014-05-12_at_1.27.01_pm""></p> \n<h3>Why so many cyclists do this illegally already</h3> \n<p>So many cyclists do these things on their own — without even knowing they're enshrined in law anywhere — because they make sense, in terms of the energy expended by a cyclist as he or she rides.</p> \n<p>Unlike a car, g<span>etting a bike started from a standstill requires a lot of energy from the rider. Once it's going, the bike's own momentum carries it forward, so it requires much less energy.</span></p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""right"">Getting a bike started from a standstill requires a lot of energy</q></p> \n<p>In 2001, physics professor Joel Fajans <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://nacto.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Fajans-J.-and-M.-Curry.-2001..pdf"">conducted tests</a> on California Street in Berkeley — an official bike route with tons of stop signs — and found he was able to maintain an average speed of 10.9 miles per hour without breaking a sweat. On a parallel street without stop signs, he could cruise about 30 percent faster — 14.2 miles per hour — with the same amount of energy.</p> \n<p>He also calculated that a cyclist who rolls through a stop at five miles per hour instead of stopping fully needs to use 25 percent less energy to get back to full speed.</p> \n<p>This explains why many cyclists roll through stop signs so often. Of course, the simple fact that people often do something that's against the law doesn't mean the law should be changed — but here are a few reasons why it really should:</p> \n<h3>The Idaho stop isn't more dangerous — and might even be safer</h3> \n<p><img alt=""92972287"" class=""photo"" src=""http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/assets/4428445/92972287.jpg""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Spencer Platt/Getty Images</p> \n<p>For drivers, the idea of cyclists rolling through an intersection without fully stopping might sound dangerous — but because of their<span> slower speed and wider field of vision (compared to cars), </span><span>cyclists are generally able to assess whether there's oncoming traffic and make the right decision. Even law-abiding urban bikers already do this all the time: because of the worry that cars might not see a bike, cyclists habitually scan for oncoming traffic even at intersections where they don't have a stop sign so they can brake at the last second just in case.</span></p> \n<p>There are even a few reasons why the Idaho stop might even make the roads <i>safer</i> than the status quo. In many cities, the low-traffic routes that are safer for bikes are the kinds of roads with many stop signs. Currently, some cyclists avoid these routes and take faster, higher-traffic streets. If the Idaho stop were legalized, it'd get cyclists off these faster streets and funnel the bikes on to safer, slower roads.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""right"">The idaho stop could funnel bikes on to safer, slower roads</q></p> \n<p>The Idaho stop, if legalized and widely adopted, would also make bikes more predictable. Currently, when a bike and a car both pull up to a four-way stop, <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://priceonomics.com/why-nice-bikers-ignore-stop-signs/"">an awkward dance often ensues</a>. Even when cars get there first, drivers often try to give bikers the right-of-way, perhaps because they think the cyclist is going to ride through anyway.</p> \n<p>If the cyclist logically waits, both parties end up sitting there, <span>urging the other to go on. In the opposite (and rarer) scenario, both people assume the other will wait, leading to a totally unnecessary accident.</span></p> \n<p>An Idaho stop would put an end to this madness: the first vehicle to come to the intersection always has the right of way, giving bikers a rule they'd actually follow, making them more predictable for drivers.</p> \n<p><span>If all this sounds far-fetched to you, look at the data.

Because both bikes and cars are wheeled vehicles that use roads, the principle goes, they should always abide by all of the same rules.</span></p> \n<p>This sounds great, in theory, but it doesn't describe the reality of current traffic laws.<span> Most interstate highways don't allow bicycles, for instance. Many cities have bike lanes that cars can't enter. They're clearly two different sorts of vehicles, and we have rules that apply to one but not the other.</span></p> \n<p><span>Consider another group of road users that stop signs weren't designed for:</span><span> pedestrians. Like bikes, pedestrians don't need to come to a complete stop to avoid accidents at intersections, which is why you don't see them weirdly freezing in place when they arrive at one. In most areas, skateboarders, Segway riders, inline skaters, and people in electric wheelchairs aren't required to stop at stop signs either.</span></p> \n<p><span></span></p> \n<p><span>Ultimately, a</span><span> cyclist occupies a space</span><span> somewhere in between a pedestrian and a car (faster and more dangerous to others than the former, but smaller and slower than the latter), so the laws that apply to bikes should be somewhere in between — exactly like the Idaho stop.</span></p> \n<h3><span>Laws that serve no purpose (and aren't followed) shouldn't exist</span></h3> \n<p>This is a principle that's frequently brought up in support of marijuana legalization, and it's relevant here as well.</p> \n<p>Given that this behavior is common among cyclists, the current laws mainly<span> criminalize something strongly associated with cycling. This might even enflame drivers' resentment of bikers</span><span> more than</span><span> if by rolling through stop signs, they weren't breaking the law. The laws also</span><span> divert police from cutting down on actual unsafe biking behavior — like the jerks who fly through intersections at full speed when they </span><i style=""line-height: 1.5;"">don't </i><span>have the right of way.</span></p> \n<p><span>We even have precedent for a logical, forward-thinking regional movement to ease restrictive traffic laws</span><span> going nationwide.

The researchers found that overall injuries for bicyclists went <i>down</i> by about 28 percent in the bikeshare cities (and head injuries went down 14 percent). But head injuries as a proportion of all bike injuries went up.</span></p> \n<p>The first finding is more important — but it was largely ignored in the initial round of coverage. Even though bikeshare programs encourage more people to bike without a helmet, the overall number of head injuries by bicyclists declined. That's especially notable given that the number of miles biked went up in bikeshare cities.</p> \n<p><span>Here's a full explanation of the study — and how it became so distorted.</span></p> \n<h3>What the study actually found</h3> \n<p><span>The study, by a team of researchers from Washington State University and elsewhere, looked at head injuries in five cities that started bikeshare programs (DC, Minneapolis, </span><span>Montreal, Boston, and Miami Beach), comparing them to five cities that didn't (</span><span>New York, Milwaukee, Seattle, Los Angeles, and Vancouver).</span></p> \n<p><span>Using emergency room data, they tracked injury rates for the two years that preceded the introduction of each city's program and compared them to the year that came afterward.</span></p> \n<p>One of their findings — which was featured prominently in the <a href=""http://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/abs/10.2105/AJPH.2014.302012"" target=""_blank"">abstract</a>, the <a href=""http://hsnewsbeat.uw.edu/story/communal-cycling-linked-more-head-injuries"" target=""_blank"">university press release</a>, and subsequent <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2014/06/12/cities-with-bike-share-programs-see-rise-in-cyclist-head-injuries/"" target=""_blank"">media coverage</a> — was that in the bikeshare cities, head injuries constituted about 42 percent of all bike accident injuries before the programs were introduced, and about 50 percent afterward. In the control cities, on the other hand, the figure dipped slightly, from 38 to 36 percent.</p> \n<p><img alt=""Bb1e3e67e"" class=""photo"" src=""http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/assets/4623065/bb1e3e67e.jpg""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">American Journal of Public Health, Graves et. al.</p> \n<p>Citing <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22542733"">studies</a> showing <span>bikeshare riders wear helmets at significantly lower rates (</span><span>in </span><span>Boston and Washington, 19.2 percent wore them, compared with 51.4 percent of all bikers), the researchers infer that bikeshare is part of the problem.</span></p> \n<p>In the paper itself, they represented all this accurately, stating ""the odds of a head injury <i>among injured bicyclists</i> increased in PBSP [public bike share program] cities after program implementation."" (Emphasis mine.)</p> \n<p>But in media coverage, they misrepresented the <i>percentage </i>increase as a <i>total </i>increase in head injuries. <span>""Public bike-share initiatives are great wellness initiatives,"" Janessa Graves, the study's lead author, </span><a href=""http://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2014/06/12/321332737/brain-injuries-rose-in-cities-where-bike-sharing-rolled-out"" target=""_blank"" style=""line-height: 1.5; background-color: #ffffff;"">told NPR</a><span>. ""But without providing helmets, we were concerned that we would see an increase in head injuries. And we did.""</span></p> \n<h3>But head injuries declined significantly when bikeshare programs were introduced</h3> \n<p><span>Kay Teschke, a </span><span>University of British Columbia cycling researcher, first </span><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://twitter.com/kteschke/status/477463870790184960"">spotted the big error</a><span> in this interpretation. </span></p> \n<p><span>Yes, head injuries increased as a percentage of all bike accident injuries after bikeshare programs were rolled. But that's only because the total number of bike-related injuries dropped so dramatically — by about 28 percent on average. Head injuries fell too, just not by as much: they dropped by about 14 percent.</span></p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""right"">to put it charitably, this seems like a strange and misguided interpretation of the data</q></p> \n<p>As a rough analogy, imagine a school has a graduating class with one thousand students. Teachers implement <span>a novel teaching strategy — say, giving out flashcards for them to use — and then give them a test. On the previous test, 100 students got D's, and 100 got F's, but on the latest test, only 72 get D's, and 86 get F's.</span></p> \n<p><span>The big takeaway, obviously, is that fewer students are failing, perhaps due to the flashcards. A much subtler finding is that </span><span>students who got F's constitute an increased percentage of failing students (we're counting D as a failing grade here). But </span><span>inexplicably</span><span>, that's what the researchers chose to focus on in this new study.</span></p> \n<p>To put it charitably, this seems like a strange and misguided interpretation of the data (As Jaffe at CityLab put it, ""they seemed to miss the forest for the trees""). A more critical view would be that the researchers went looking for evidence that bikeshare programs are dangerous, and upon failing to find any, <span>cherry-picked a relatively unimportant sub-trend and trumpeted it as decisive finding.</span></p> \n<h3>So how did the bikeshare programs make biking safer?</h3> \n<p><img alt=""163714458"" class=""photo"" src=""http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/assets/4623881/163714458.jpg""></p> \n<p>This is the most important and surprising question to come out of the study<span>. What makes the 28 percent decline in biking injuries (and 14 percent decline in head injuries) even more remarkable is that they happened even as people began biking dramatically more in these cities.</span></p> \n<p>In DC, for instance, bikeshare members <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://usa.streetsblog.org/2013/05/22/capital-bikeshare-members-reduced-their-driving-4-4-million-miles-per-year/"">rode 4.4 million miles in 2012</a>. We don't know how much of an increase this is compared to all biking (because we don't have data on total biking), but if it represented a five percent increase in miles biked, we'd expect to see at least a five percent increase in total injuries and head injuries. To see these declines means biking in DC has gotten a lot safer since bikeshare was introduced, even if a smaller percentage of bikers is wearing helmets.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""right"">the most reasonable interpretation is that the programs made biking safer by putting many more bikes on the road</q></p> \n<p>What could account for this surprising trend? <span>One possibility is the basic fact </span><span>that the number of bikers on the road </span><a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.cyclehelmets.org/1186.html#80"">most strongly predicts biking safely</a> — and that helmet use <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/5/16/5720762/stop-forcing-people-to-wear-bike-helmets"">doesn't seem to be strongly correlated</a> with it.</p> \n<p>When drivers get used to seeing cyclists everywhere, they're much less likely to hit them.

Why free parking is bad for everyone,http://www.vox.com/2014/6/27/5849280/why-free-parking-is-bad-for-everyone,It seems like a boon. But it's a menace.,"<p>America is built around cars. And most of us expect that we'll be able to park our cars for free, pretty much anywhere we go.</p> \n<p>But economist Donald Shoup of UCLA has made a name for himself by advocating an alternative scheme: charging for street parking anywhere there are more people with cars than spaces to park.</p> \n<p>Shoup's 2005 book, <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.amazon.com/High-Cost-Parking-Updated-Edition/dp/193236496X""><i>The High Cost of Free Parking</i></a>, articulated why <span>exactly </span><span>he thinks free parking is such a bad idea.

Even though planes spend a lot of time cruising at high altitude, the most dangerous part is at the very end and very beginning.

Popular Mechanics</p> \n<p>In 2007, Popular Mechanics went through 36 years of fatal US crashes to try to find where the people who survived them sat. They <a href=""http://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/aviation/safety/4219452"">concluded </a>that the back of the plane was better. However, because such crashes are so rare, there were only 20 crashes available for analysis. And that makes it unclear if this is just a statistical fluke in a small data set.</p> \n<p>The magazine's story also included a quotation from the FAA, which said that there's no way to know which area is safest. But since it's unlikely that sitting in the back will harm you, you may as well go for it if you want.</p>",Transportation
How dangerous is it to use headphones on a bike?,http://www.vox.com/2014/8/7/5956899/bike-headphones-safe-dangerous-riding,Is listening while riding reasonable or idiotic?,"<p>It's not uncommon to spot cyclists in a city riding around with earbuds crammed firmly into each ear.</p> \n<p>To many people, this seems insane: city riding is dangerous to begin with, and eliminating one of your senses can only make it more perilous.</p> \n<p>But others have countered <span>that most headphones don't block out all sound, that </span><span>it's not really so different from drivers listening to music in their cars.</span><span> And, they'll add, hearing </span><span>really isn't that crucial</span><span> for biking safely.</span></p> \n<p>The biggest problem with resolving this argument: there's no data on bikers' accident rates that compared headphone users with the rest. <span>For what it's worth, the majority of states do not outlaw riding with headphones (although many</span><span> </span><a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.wsdot.wa.gov/bike/safety.htm"" style=""line-height: 1.5; background-color: #ffffff;"">recommend against</a><span> it).

But one informal study, </span><a target=""_blank"" href=""http://rideons.wordpress.com/2012/07/09/an-ear-on-the-traffic/"" style=""line-height: 1.5;"">conducted by Australia's bike magazine RideOn</a>,<span> seems to support the idea that it might not be all that dangerous.</span></p> \n<p>For the study, a pair of reporters used both a decibel meter and their own ears to do some testing. They found that a person wearing earbuds and listening to music from an iPod turned almost all the way up (playing at 87 decibels) could hear someone else calling out ""passing"" and a bike bell ringing from about 32 feet away. They also found that someone sitting inside a car and listening to slightly softer music (69 dB) from the car stereo couldn't hear either of these sounds.</p> \n<p><q class=""right"" aria-hidden=""true"">Normal earbuds don't fully mask sound, and allow a rider to hear warning sounds</q></p> \n<p>Their conclusions: normal earbuds don't mask sound nearly as fully as a car's closed doors, and allow a rider to hear warning sounds from other riders. (Note that they also tested in-ear earbuds, which <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.cnet.com/topics/headphones/best-headphones/earbuds/"">sit inside the ear canal</a>, and found they blocked outside sounds much more fully.)</p> \n<p><a style=""line-height: 1.5;"" href=""http://www.bikexprt.com/bicycle/hearing.htm"" target=""_blank"">Others say that</a> whether or not headphones block noise, a cyclist's sense of hearing simply isn't that important. Hearing a car approach from behind gives a biker just a few seconds of warning, and in an urban environment, distinguishing the sound of an approaching vehicle from ambient noise is extremely difficult. Safely riding a bike, they say, like driving a car, does not depend heavily on listening — which is why there are no laws banning people with hearing problems from riding.</p> \n<p>Some headphone advocates go so far as to say that listening to <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/17450101.2013.796772#.U-KDyoBdU01"" style=""line-height: 1.5;"">music helps bikers relax and become more attuned to their surroundings</a> — a bit like the many <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/sep/26/music-for-surgery"">surgeons who listen to music</a> while operating.</p> \n<h3>The argument against headphones</h3> \n<p><img src=""http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/assets/4868914/5559991654_723fba7cab_o.jpg"" class=""photo"" alt=""5559991654_723fba7cab_o""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">(<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/yourdon/5559991654/in/photolist-9tjpP5-dx6mou-9tVzjz-f41Jgs-fXD6m9-8EpwmM-o7feh3-i4yN1c"">Ed Yourdon</a>)<br id=""1407362741505""></p> \n<p>The case against headphones is more straightforward.

Taking away your second most important sense adds an unnecessary risk to biking, and can only make it more dangerous.</p> \n<p>That's because listening, <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.slate.com/articles/life/a_fine_whine/2012/11/cycling_with_headphones_is_incredibly_dumb_why_does_anyone_do_it.html"">the anti-headphone crowd says</a>, can alert a cyclist to all sorts of subtle aural cues in the chaotic city riding environment: say, a car approaching from behind, another bike about to pull into a darkened intersection, or a kid or dog about to run into the street. Especially for the huge percentage of bikers who don't come to a complete stop at intersections, listening carefully is a must.</p> \n<p>Finally: the benefits of wearing headphones (that is, music) apply solely to the bike rider, but the potential costs are passed on to all the pedestrians and other riders he or she might potentially hit. So riding with headphones on can be construed as not only an unnecessary risk, but a selfish unnecessary risk.</p> \n<h3>Our take</h3> \n<p><img src=""http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/assets/4868858/7209203662_147e0528d5_o.jpg"" class=""photo"" alt=""7209203662_147e0528d5_o""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">(<a href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/midgley/7209203662"" target=""_blank"">Adrian Midgley</a>)</p> \n<p>As someone who's previously argued that bikers <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/5/9/5691098/why-cyclists-should-be-able-to-roll-through-stop-signs-and-ride"">should be able to roll through stop signs</a> and expressed <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/5/16/5720762/stop-forcing-people-to-wear-bike-helmets"">skepticism about the importance of helmets</a>, I picked up this issue expecting to come down on the side of headphones being relatively safe.</p> \n<p>But given the lack of any real data, I decided to test things for myself. When I did so<span> — riding around Washington, DC with listening to music for the first time ever — I was struck by how disconnected I suddenly felt</span><span> from my surroundings, far more than I'd expected.</span></p> \n<p><span></span><span>Wearing a pair of earbuds revealed ways I use my ears when riding that I had no idea of. When making a right after waiting at a red light, I realized I had to look back to see if any other bikers had pulled up beside me, to ensure I wouldn't be cutting them off right when they started pedaling. On a quiet residential street, I was no longer capable of knowing whether or not a car was cruising behind me — I had to periodically turn to look. </span><span>And the whole time, I felt a strange paranoia because I might not be able to hear if anyone spoke or beeped at me.</span></p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""center"">wearing earbuds revealed ways i use my ears when riding that i had no idea of</q></p> \n<p><span>All these things could probably be compensated for, mainly by doing some extra glancing and turning. This was my first time wearing headphones, and I'd likely get used to doing it over time. </span><span>But the experience indicated that, at least for me, listening is a tool I unconsciously use to be more fully aware of my surroundings as I bike.</span></p> \n<p>Ultimately, my personal experiment doesn't provide any firmer evidence than is already out there about bikes and headphones. There just isn't any data, one way or the other. <span>But if we weigh all possibilities, it's easy to see that the cost of being overcautious (not getting to enjoy music while riding) is much smaller than the penalty of being not cautious enough (getting injured or killed on a bike).

The only people who have a list of Lyft drivers is Lyft itself, and obviously Lyft is not going to help Uber poach their own drivers. </span></p> \n<p><span>So Uber did the obvious thing: they hailed Lyft cars and used the rides as an excuse to make their recruitment pitch, paying the Lyft drivers for their time like any other customer.

But if Uber intended these cancellations as an act of deliberate sabotage, the campaign was way too small to be a major threat, or even a significant </span>nuisance<span>.</span></p> \n<p>The internal Uber document released by the Verge offers a more likely explanation for these cancellations: Uber reps were trying not to waste drivers' time.</p> \n<p><chorus-asset data-id=""674392"" class=""chorus-snippet browser_wide_media""> <img src=""http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/674392/cancellation.0.png"" class=""small"" alt=""Cancellation""> </chorus-asset></p> \n<p><span>Many drivers will be happy to hear the ""switch to Uber"" pitch from recruiters once. But they'd probably be annoyed to get it over and over again. So as soon as an Uber recruiter found out that he'd hailed a ride from someone he'd already talked to, he may have just cancelled the trip to save everyone the hassle. Notice that Uber's instructions tell reps to wait at least 5 minutes between trips to <i>minimize</i> the number of times they have to cancel.</span></p> \n<p><span>Now, maybe it would have been more polite to keep the appointment and take a short trip so that the Lyft driver gets paid. I don't know if the average Lyft driver would rather get a quick cancellation or a short fare. But getting one cancelled ride from an Uber recruiter over 9 months — and remember, Lyft's own figure suggests that 90 percent of Lyft drivers got </span><i style=""line-height: 1.5;"">zero</i><span> cancelled fares from Uber reps — is hardly a serious imposition.</span></p> \n<p>Meanwhile, Uber's recruitment campaign was good for Lyft drivers, both those who talked to an Uber rep and those who didn't. Knowing that every driver had the option to switch to Uber gives Lyft drivers more leverage in pay negotiations. If I were a Lyft driver, I'd think that a 10 percent chance of getting one cancelled ride was a small price to pay for a better chance of getting a raise.</p> \n<p><b>Update:</b> I added a screenshot from Uber's recruitment document.</p>",Transportation

By contrast, commuter rail operators normally just announce a track a bit in advance and let people wait there. Most foreign intercity rail operators (and indeed Amtrak itself) use the free-boarding method.</p> \n<p>Amtrak's queuing system appears to be modeled on the standard international process for boarding airplanes. The difference, however, is that airplanes only have one door so a queue is inevitable. As trains have many doors, this is unnecessary and the free-boarding system plainly works.

At the UN climate summit on Tuesday, some 200 cities <a href=""http://www.un.org/climatechange/summit/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2014/05/CITIES-PR.pdf"">announced</a> that they were taking voluntary measures to cut emissions by some 454 megatons by 2020. As Zack Colman <a href=""http://washingtonexaminer.com/cities-set-the-pace-on-climate-change/article/2553808"">reports</a> in the <i>Washington Examiner</i>, the mayors of Houston, LA, and Philadelphia are all setting new emissions goals.</p> \n<p><span>One big example: New York City Mayor Bill DeBlasio </span><a href=""http://gothamist.com/2014/09/21/de_blasio_unveils_ambitious_plan_to.php"">has declared</a><span> that his city will retrofit some 3,000 publicly-owned buildings over the next 10 years, in order to reduce the energy needed to heat, power, and cool them. The city is ultimately planning to cut emissions 80 percent by 2050.</span></p> \n<h3>Green cities could also make it easier for people to live there</h3> \n<p> </p> \n<center> <img src=""http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/1399694/4428223881_cda56dba8e_o.0.jpg"" alt=""downtown san francisco""> </center> \n<p class=""caption"">Downtown San Francisco (<a href=""https://www.flickr.com/search/?text=san%20francisco&amp;sort=relevance&amp;license=1%2C2%2C3%2C4%2C5%2C6"">David Yu/Flickr</a>)</p> \n<p><span>If anything, the C40 report probably understates what cities could do.</span></p> \n<p><q class=""right"" aria-hidden=""true"">Many 'green' cities still limit construction and prevent people from living there</q></p> \n<p>Over at <i>Scientific American</i>, David Biello has an excellent piece titled ""<a href=""http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/climate-change-will-be-solved-in-cities-or-not-at-all/"">Climate Change Will Be Solved In The Cities — Or Not At All</a>"" that details additional measures some cities are taking. In China, cities like Shenzhen are starting to set up their own carbon markets. Paris is experimenting with policies to bolster the spread of electric cars.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, the C40 report doesn't really talk about another crucial policy angle — cities that really want to be green could make it easier for more people to actually live in them. Study after study <a href=""http://newscenter.berkeley.edu/2014/01/06/suburban-sprawl-cancels-carbon-footprint-savings-of-dense-urban-cores/"">has found</a> that people who live in dense urban areas have a lower carbon footprint than people who live in, say, the suburbs. Part of that's the difference in driving. It's also more efficient to heat a multi-unit apartment building than it is to heat a block of detached homes.</p> \n<p>Yet many cities, like San Francisco, restrict construction of new housing or taller buildings and prevent more people from being able to live there, as my colleague Matthew Yglesias has detailed <a href=""http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2013/04/11/san_francisco_zoning_needs_more_density_and_tall_buildings.html"">again</a> and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/The-Rent-Too-Damn-High-ebook/dp/B0078XGJXO"">again</a>. Letting more people move there might increase an individual cities' emissions — but it could decrease emissions overall.</p> \n<h3>That said, there are limits to what cities can do</h3> \n<p>Now, there's obviously a limit to how much mayors can do by themselves. Even the C40 report notes that aggressive action by all of the mayors of all of the world's major cities would only produce about 15 percent of the cuts necessary to avoid 2°C of warming.</p> \n<p>That's because the really hard problem on climate change is where our energy comes from. Right now, <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/6/19/5821250/these-5-charts-show-why-the-world-is-still-failing-on-climate-change"">about 87 percent</a> of the world's energy use comes from oil, natural gas, and coal — a fraction that hasn't budged since 1999:</p> \n<p><img src=""http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/assets/4633463/global_energy_use_by_source__NEW_.png"" class=""photo"" alt=""Global_energy_use_by_source__new_""></p> \n<p><span>If we want to start reducing global greenhouse-gas emissions and stop the planet from overheating, that will have to change. And shifting the world's energy mix will involve big advancements in clean energy as well as policies to deploy those technologies — say, a </span><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_tax"">carbon tax</a><span>, or renewable-energy mandates. </span></p> \n<p><q class=""right"" aria-hidden=""true"">Cities don't always even have the tools to change their transportation policies</q></p> \n<p><span>Cities have some tools they can deploy here — for instance, Los Angeles </span><a href=""http://la.curbed.com/archives/2012/04/la_making_it_easier_to_put_solar_on_rooftops_and_parking_lots.php"">recently made it easier</a><span> to install solar panels on rooftops and parking lots. But they're also often limited in how much they can do. (For a good example, see Austin's </span><a href=""http://kut.org/post/new-proposal-coal-free-austin-could-end-citys-lcra-partnership"">long-standing struggle</a><span> to end its reliance on coal.) The mayor of Rio de Janeiro, Eduardo Paes, </span><a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/sep/24/rio-de-janeiro-mayor-give-cities-power-over-energy-to-help-climate-fight"">has been calling on</a><span> national governments to find ways to give cities more autonomy over energy policy — but it's slow going.</span></p> \n<p>Indeed, cities don't always even have the tools to change their own transportation policies. In the United States, for instance, transit policy is influenced <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/dr-gridlock/wp/2014/09/24/pew-report-highlights-local-state-federal-role-in-transportation-funding/"">by a bewildering mix</a> of federal, state, and local governments. Mayors who want to curtail sprawl or promote transit usually need to work with other policymakers on a variety of different levels. No city can go it alone.</p> \n<p>Still, the broader point of the C40 report — and Biello's <a href=""http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/climate-change-will-be-solved-in-cities-or-not-at-all/"">excellent piece</a> — is that cities have a key role to play in climate policy.

Don't blame bike messengers for riding like maniacs. Blame theirÂ bosses,http://www.vox.com/2014/10/3/6839359/bike-messengers-pay,Messengers have a very rational reason for riding recklessly.,"<p>If you live in a big city, you've probably seen bike messengers riding recklessly.</p> \n<p>They ride fast — really fast. They go the wrong way on one-way streets. <span>They dart in and out of car traffic, and weave through it to cross busy streets when they hit a red light. </span><span>In fact, some might argue that by committing a disproportionate amount of the reckless riding that goes on, they give all bicyclists a bad name.</span></p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""right"">messengers are paid per delivery, and very little</q></p> \n<p>But while their reckless riding might make bikers look bad, the truth is that <span>the messengers riding this way are just doing their jobs.</span></p> \n<p>That's because virtually all these messengers are paid per delivery, and in most cases, making enough deliveries per day to earn a decent wage requires breaking traffic laws — and at times, riding a bit recklessly. It's as if a waiter or waitress had to knock over customers to serve meals fast enough to earn a tip.</p> \n<p>If you see a bike messenger riding like a maniac, your instinct is probably to grumble, shake your fist, and curse all bikers. But in reality, they're working a dangerous, low-paying job — and are victims of a bigger, systemic problem.</p> \n<h3>The hard job of a bike messenger</h3> \n<p><iframe frameborder=""0"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/N294ROLXeKo?rel=0"" height=""480"" width=""853""></iframe></p> \n<p>The BuzzFeed video above gives you a good idea of the nonstop, frenetic riding style most bike messengers employ. To get to their next stop as quickly as possible, they do all kinds of things that a casual biker probably wouldn't consider trying.</p> \n<p>They <span>squeeze between lanes of stopped or slow traffic, and frequently dart up one-way streets. The most characteristic bike messenger move occurs when they approach a red light with traffic flowing through the street they want to cross. Instead of stopping, they turn and briefly ride with the traffic. Then, when there's a break in it, they turn left across the intersection and proceed.</span></p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""right"">Their injury rate is more than 15 times the national average for all jobs</q></p> \n<p><span>These maneuvers are all aimed at one basic goal: completing deliveries as quickly as possible. </span><span>""When you're riding at a good pace, the last thing you want to do is stop,"" says Behzad Larry, a former messenger for New York City's </span><a target=""_blank"" href=""http://breakawaycourier.com/"" style=""line-height: 1.5; background-color: #ffffff;"">Breakaway Courier</a><span>. </span></p> \n<p><span>Another Cleveland bike messenger who didn't want his name used in this article agrees: </span><span>""M</span><span>y basic rule on jobs is limit time of possession to as short as I can."" </span>He adds that this means getting deliveries done ""as fast as is safe to do so.""</p> \n<p>But ultimately, a mentality centered around speed is dangerous — to pedestrians, but more often, to bike messengers themselves. <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/ergonomics/bike/index.html"">One multi-year survey</a> of 113 Boston bike messengers found that, each year, 47 out of 100 suffered an injury that forced them to miss work — most often, bone fractures, followed by dislocations, sprains, and strains.</p> \n<p>That Boston study was a small survey (and it's tough to conduct a big one given how small the bike courier profession is), but that injury rate is more than 15 times the <a href=""http://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/osh.pdf"" target=""_blank"">national average</a> for all jobs.

That means that wages are low and stagnant. ""The rates? In Cleveland they haven't gone up in over a decade plus,"" the anonymous messenger told me. ""<span>I'd love to see an across-the-board rate increase, but it's never going to happen.""</span></p> \n<p>Larry, who delivered in New York City in 2007, recalls being paid $5 per delivery, and being capable of typically making 15 deliveries per day.

But the problem is much bigger than any one individual courier. It's the set of circumstances that provide incentives for riding fast and breaking traffic laws.</p> \n<p>The main people responsible for these circumstances are the courier companies that employ these messengers. If they paid an hourly wage — or at least provided a pay floor for messengers for the times they aren't able to safely make enough deliveries to meet it — it'd dramatically reduce the incentive to ride recklessly.</p> \n<p><span>That said, it's fair to note that </span><span>a company opting to pay more might have difficulty competing with companies that don't.

Newspapers weren't late to online news â€” they were way too early,http://www.vox.com/2014/9/25/6840401/innovation-can-take-a-lot-longer-than-people-think,A New York Times article describes the first experiments with online news â€” in 1980.,"<p>When a new technology is invented, there's often a lot of doubt about its utility. People have trouble imagining how a seemingly exotic technology could be useful to ordinary people. And there are often major concerns — cost, reliability, safety — that seem like obstacles to widespread adoption. Bitcoin, self-driving cars, and personalized DNA testing are three examples of technologies that seem to have a lot of potential, but currently face a lot of public skepticism.</p> \n<p>A big reason for this is that people often underestimate how long it takes for new technologies to become mainstream. The New York Times recently<span> </span><a href=""https://twitter.com/NYTArchives/status/514851827913723904"" style=""line-height: 1.5; background-color: #ffffff;"">tweeted out</a><span> a fascinating article from its archives that illustrates this point. It's about newspaper executives' early experiments with digital news services. And the article isn't from 1995, when the internet first came to widespread attention. It's from 1980 — a decade before the World Wide Web was even invented.</span></p> \n<p>Here's what people were saying about online news in 1980, and what lessons it holds for today's cutting-edge technologies.</p> \n<h3>In 1980, people were already debating if online news would kill newspapers</h3> \n<blockquote> \n<p>""We see it as a new development on the communications scene,"" said John C. Quinn, vice president for news at the Gannett Company. ""My own view is that it will evolve into an additional service for the public, not unlike what happened with television after World War II. Remember how TV was going to kill radio and newspapers?""</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""right"">The first mouse was invented in 1965, but it took until the mid-1990s for mice to be a standard computer feature</q></p> \n<p>Back in 1980, the possibility of computers killing newspapers seemed remote. And it was! Electronic news services wouldn't pose a serious threat to newspapers for another 20 years.</p> \n<p>Yet of course, in the long run, computers <i>did</i> pose an existential threat to newspapers.</p> \n<h3>Newspapers were already worried about falling behind the curve</h3> \n<blockquote> \n<p>""We are advising those who own information to experiment and get involved now,"" said Haines Gaffner, president of Link, one of the leading advisory companies monitoring the new electronic information services. ""But many publishers are by nature conservative and their attitude is 'We can wait' and let pioneers like Knight-Ridder do the experimenting.""</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Some pundits fault newspapers for failing to anticipate technological change and adapt to it. But I think this illustrates how unrealistic it can be to advise companies to experiment with new technologies as early as possible. The reality is that no amount of experimentation in 1980 would have prepared newspapers for the challenges they would face a quarter of a century later.</p> \n<p>The market for online news services was so tiny in the 1980s that it would have been impossible to make significant profits in the electronic news business.</p> \n<p>These early news services didn't use the internet, which at the time was still just a university research project. One of the services the Times mentions was part of the dial-up service Compuserve. The other was apparently a dedicated dial-up service. These kinds of proprietary dial-up services were rendered obsolete by the internet in the 1990s, and newspapers' investments in them wound up being wasted.</p> \n<p><chorus-asset data-id=""1400498"" class=""chorus-snippet browser_wide_media""> <img src=""http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/1400498/13900465383_9e32cc0b1b_k.0.jpg"" class=""small"" alt=""13900465383_9e32cc0b1b_k.0.jpg""> </chorus-asset></p> \n<p class=""caption"">A 1981 ad for CompuServe, which cost $5 per hour ($13 per hour in 2014 dollars) to use.

And based on those experiments, they concluded that online services weren't a serious threat to their business.</p> \n<h3>People underestimated how much better computers would get</h3> \n<p>Eventually, of course, online news became a viable business. The reason is that computers got a lot better:</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>""Our concern,"" he said, ""was that if people might get their information in this way, they might no longer need newspapers.""</p> \n<p>This, of course, is the concern of the entire industry, although those in the business are quick to point out that a newspaper <span>costs only a fraction of what it costs to have at hand a personal computer that will provide the newspaper's equivalent on its screen. They also note that you cannot tuck a computer under your arm as you head for the subway, any more than you can use a home computer to swat flies, wrap fish, or train the dog.</span></p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Computers in 1980 were big, bulky, and expensive. You couldn't put them under your arm and carry them on the subway. Today, of course, computers not only fit under your arm but in your pocket. And computers are a lot cheaper than they used to be, dramatically expanding the market for electronic news services.</p> \n<h3>New technologies often take 30 years go to mainstream</h3> \n<p>The long lag between initial experiments with online news and the maturity of the online news industry isn't unusual. Indeed, as Microsoft researcher Bill Buxton has <a href=""http://www.billbuxton.com/multitouchOverview.html"">pointed out</a>, 30 years is a typical period of time between the first experiments with a new technology and mainstream commercial success.</p> \n<p>The first mouse was invented in 1965, but it took until the mid-1990s for mice to be a standard computer feature. The first packet-switched network was invented in 1969, but the internet didn't become mainstream until the late 1990s. Multitouch interfaces were first developed in the early 1980s, but didn't become a mainstream technology until the iPhone in 2007.</p> \n<p>That suggests we shouldn't underestimate the disruptive potential of technologies, like self-driving cars, personalized DNA testing, and Bitcoin, that seem exotic and impractical today.</p> \n<p>The first fully self-driving cars were developed <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DARPA_Grand_Challenge#2005_Grand_Challenge"">about a decade ago</a>, suggesting it might take another two decades for computer scientists to turn the technology into a mainstream consumer product. Similarly, the technology to sequence an entire human genome has only been around for about 15 years. It's not surprising that we're still figuring out how to make it useful.</p> \n<p>It seems likely that some kind of internet-based cryptocurrency will come into widespread use in the coming decades. But it might take a while for people to figure out how to use the technology effectively.

Tesla also announced a slew of new ""autopilot"" features for all of its Model S versions. The vehicles will now come outfitted with an array of cameras, sensors, and software that give them vast new self-driving capabilities. Tesla cars will be able to change lanes on their own, obey speed-limit signs, and even park themselves.</p> \n<p>Tesla's newest vehicles won't be completely autonomous. And they certainly won't come cheap — starting at around $70,000. But they do look like a major step toward a day when vehicles can drive themselves completely:</p> \n<h3>New Tesla D features: All-wheel drive and ""autopilot""</h3> \n<p><img src=""http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2342538/454671390.0.jpg"" alt=""454671390.0.jpg"" data-chorus-asset-id=""2342538""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">The Tesla D will look a lot like the Tesla Model S (above), only... much more powerful. (Sean Gallup/Getty Images News)</p> \n<p><b>A powerful new dual motor:</b> The Tesla D is essentially an all-wheel drive version of the company's existing Model S electric sedan. The ""D"" here stands for ""dual motor"" — one for the front wheels, one for the back. This is something other luxury carmakers were already offering, and Tesla was catching up.</p> \n<p><q class=""right"" aria-hidden=""true"">Tesla is taking autopilot a few steps further than its competitors</q></p> \n<p>The dual-motor version will be significantly more powerful than the Model S, capable of going from 0 to 60 miles per hour in a mere 3.2 seconds. It's also supposedly more efficient: Musk <a href=""http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2014/10/09/tesla-musk-safety-driver-aids/16986665/"">told</a> <i>USA Today</i> that the Model D can travel an additional 10 miles on a single charge.</p> \n<p><b>Autopilot:</b> Then there's the ""autopilot."" Both the Tesla D and the regular Tesla S will now come with a variety of upgraded sensors — including an image-recognition camera, a 360-degree sonar system that can ""see"" its surroundings, and a long-range radar to recognize signs and pedestrians:</p> \n<blockquote class=""twitter-tweet"" lang=""en""> \n<p>Every new Model S is Autopilot enabled. <a href=""http://t.co/KH9Mx7GF21"">pic.twitter.com/KH9Mx7GF21</a></p> \n— Tesla Motors (@TeslaMotors) <a href=""https://twitter.com/TeslaMotors/status/520453842438090752"">October 10, 2014</a>\n</blockquote> \n<p>Among other things, that equipment will allow Tesla's vehicles to be aware of other cars on the road, brake in emergencies, and automatically correct course if a driver veers out of his or her lane. Those features, granted, aren't entirely novel. Competitors like Ford and Toyota had already developed lane control and automatic braking for their luxury vehicles.</p> \n<p>But Tesla's autopilot system will go even further than that. If the driver hits the turn signal on the highway, the car can look around for traffic and then change lanes automatically once all's clear. The vehicle can also automatically decelerate when it recognizes a change in speed limit.</p> \n<p style=""font-size: 15px;""><b>Self-parking: </b>On top of that, Tesla's cars will also be able to park themselves at home— the driver can get out and let the car do the rest of the work. (The electric car can't yet connect to a charger on its own, but Musk said Tesla's engineers were working on that one.) Drivers will also be able to ""summon"" their Tesla vehicles on their own property — the car can roll down the driveway autonomously and meet you at your door in the morning.</p> \n<p>Here's <a href=""http://www.slashgear.com/teslas-wicked-fast-p85d-just-drove-me-autonomously-09350131/"">a video demonstration</a> of the car's autopilot capabilities from SlashGear:</p> \n<p><iframe frameborder=""0"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/7quu551ehc0?rel=0"" height=""480"" width=""640""></iframe></p> \n<p>All these features won't be cheap, however: The all-wheel drive ""D"" version of the Model S will start at $71,000. The base price for the top-of-the-line P85D will be $120,000 — about $14,000 more than the current S version.</p> \n<h3>Is this a step toward self-driving vehicles?</h3> \n<p>Futurists have long been dreaming about the day <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/5/28/5756736/the-case-for-self-driving-cars"">when cars can drive themselves</a> — a technology that has the potential to reduce accidents, speed up traffic, and make commuting a far less hellish activity.</p> \n<p>Putting more and more autonomous capabilities in a car — as Tesla is doing — is a step closer. Still, it's a massive leap from a car that can park itself to a car that can drive itself without human intervention, as Musk reportedly conceded at the LA event, according to Fox Business reporter Jo Ling Kent:</p> \n<blockquote class=""twitter-tweet"" lang=""en""> \n<p>""This is still autopilot not autonomous..it's not at the level where you can fall asleep and arrive safely at destination."" -Musk</p> \n— Jo Ling Kent (@jolingkent) <a href=""https://twitter.com/jolingkent/status/520415562628104193"">October 10, 2014</a>\n</blockquote> \n<p>Currently, a number of auto companies are experimenting with self-driving vehicles in California, which has begun to allow road tests. But there are several different approaches here.</p> \n<p>Google, for one, thinks that the way to do it is by creating a car <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/5/27/5756524/google-is-building-real-self-driving-cars-without-a-steering-wheel"">that eliminates driver control altogether</a>, rather than slowly adding autonomous capabilities over time. (There's an argument that switching back and forth between a computer driver and half-attentive human driver <a href=""http://www.technologyreview.com/view/518856/are-driverless-cars-really-just-around-the-corner/"">might actually be more dangerous</a> than just letting the computer do all the work.) Tesla, for its part, seems to be focusing on adding incremental ""autopilot"" capacities.</p> \n<p>The technology is still quite pricey, and the US is still a long ways away from making all the regulatory and licensing changes necessary to make self-driving cars a reality. But the technology is clearly getting better and better with each passing year.</p> \n<h3>Further reading on self-driving cars</h3> \n<p><b></b>15 ways that self-driving cars<a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/5/28/5756736/the-case-for-self-driving-cars""> could transform our lives</a></p> \n<p>Google <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/5/27/5756524/google-is-building-real-self-driving-cars-without-a-steering-wheel"">is building</a> real self-driving cars without steering wheels or pedals</p> \n<p>Driverless cars will mean <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/5/28/5758560/driverless-cars-will-mean-the-end-of-car-ownership"">the end of mass car ownership</a></p> \n<p>One big obstacle to self-driving cars? <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/7/31/5955141/one-big-obstacle-for-self-driving-cars-people-are-still-scared-of-them"">People are still scared of them</a>.</p> \n<p>Why trucks<a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/6/3/5775482/why-trucks-will-drive-themselves-before-cars-do""> will drive themselves</a> before cars do</p>",Transportation

Why Uber drivers can't win: they're fighting supply and demand,http://www.vox.com/xpress/2014/10/23/7049169/why-uber-drivers-cant-win-theyre-fighting-supply-and-demand,Competition is putting downward pressure on fares â€” and driver pay.,"<p>Uber used to be a premium alternative to traditional taxi cabs. But as the market has grown more competitive, Uber has aggressively slashed fares. Today, an UberX ride can be cheaper than a conventional taxi in some metropolitan areas.</p> \n<p>And many Uber drivers are <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.buzzfeed.com/johanabhuiyan/uber-drivers-protest-in-sf-and-la-while-drivers-in-ny-and-lo?utm_term=4ldqpia"">furious about it.</a> Because Uber takes a flat 20 percent of drivers' fares, the fare cuts have translated into pay cuts for drivers. On Wednesday, drivers in San Francisco and Los Angeles organized in front of Uber offices, accusing the company's white collar workers of getting rich while the drivers struggle to make ends meet.</p> \n<p>Some of the drivers' complaints have merit. For example, Uber has offered some drivers help financing the purchase of a car to allow them to drive for Uber; imposing fare cuts on these drivers could cause serious financial hardship.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""right""><span>Uber would have to reduce its share of fares to zero just to restore drivers' previous earnings</span></q></p> \n<p>But fundamentally, fares — and, therefore, driver wages — are driven by supply and demand.<span> Fares are falling because the market for taxi-like services is becoming more competitive. If Uber had maintained its previous high fares, it likely would have lost market share to Lyft or other competitors. Also, higher fares would have led customers to order fewer rides, which would have allowed Uber to employ fewer drivers.</span></p> \n<p>And while Uber could — and perhaps should — reduce its 20 percent cut, this can only do so much to boost drivers' incomes. In both <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://nypost.com/2014/09/25/uber-makes-20-percent-summer-price-cut-permanent/"">New York</a> and <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://blog.uber.com/uberxpricinglaoc"">Los Angeles</a>, for example, Uber permanently cut fares by around 20 percent at the end of the summer. So Uber would have to reduce its share of fares to zero just to restore drivers' previous earnings in those cities.</p> \n<p>In the long run, the  key question will be whether this market evolves into a de facto monopoly dominated by one company, or if it remains a highly competitive market with many ride-sharing services. If Uber eventually crushes its competition, then drivers might be able to organize and push for higher fares and higher pay.</p> \n<p>But as long as the market remains highly competitive, these kinds of protests aren't going to do much. Uber already pays its drivers around 80 percent of the fares it collects, so there's limited room to give them a higher share. And competition from other companies makes it hard to raise fares.</p>",Transportation

But the city itself — as opposed to the metonymy for the government or the politics of the nation — rarely comes into view. To actual Washingtonians, this opposition between ""DC"" where we live and ""the nation's capital"" that Americans love to hate is fundamental. Yet the city's history has been profoundly shaped by national affairs from its origins in a bizarre congressional logroll to the metro area's current status as the richest in the country.

This saw powerful Virginia politicians Thomas Jefferson and James Madison agree to Alexander Hamilton's plan for the federal government to bail out state debts incurred during the revolution in exchange for Hamilton and other Northerners agreeing to move the capital to the shores of the Potomac — a concession to Southerners. Virginia, the largest and most important Southern state, was the locus of opposition to Hamilton's assumption plan for several reasons. One was that the more agrarian Southern economies saw less benefit in establishing a stable financial system. Another was that Southern states were generally less indebted at the time. A final one was that Virginia in particular still held vast (and valuable) western landholdings that made its fiscal position more credible. Hamilton's Assumption Act had a long-term impact on the nation's finances, while its companion Residence Act has defined the capital from the beginning. The government would be established in an essentially new city, rather than an existing port that served as a center of commerce and trade.</p> \n</div> \n</li> \n<li class=""list-2 clearfix feature-photos-list-item""> \n<div class=""feature-photos-photo feature-photos-column""> \n<div class=""vox-photo-hack"">\n<a href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/leeanncafferata/4857594038/"" target=""_black""><img class=""lazy zoom"" data-src=""http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2316002/4857594038_2bd5817dcc_o.0.jpg""></a> <a href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/leeanncafferata/4857594038/"" target=""_blank"" class=""icon-link-ext-alt""></a>\n</div> \n<p class=""feature-photos-caption""><a href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/leeanncafferata/4857594038/""> Andrew Ellicott </a></p> \n</div> \n<div class=""feature-photos-story feature-photos-column""> \n<h4>The Ellicott map</h4> \n<p>The initial plan for the city was led by Pierre L'Enfant, who got himself fired. The work was then completed by Andrew Ellicott, a pioneer in what were then state-of-the-art surveying techniques. The original city of Washington was considerably smaller than the overall District of Columbia, sandwiched between the Potomac River, Rock Creek, the Anacostia River (then called the Eastern Branch), and what today is Florida Avenue. Georgetown and Alexandria were separate towns, and the District incorporated rural areas north, east, and west of the city. But inside the central core, the present-day city is very much recognizable from this early map. The main difference is the role of water. The canal north of the Mall and then running south of the Capitol was built, but is no longer in use, as water transport has gone out of style. Meanwhile, the Potomac has been narrowed and several of the smaller bodies of water wiped off the map.</p> \n</div> \n</li> \n<li class=""list-3 clearfix feature-photos-list-item""> \n<div class=""feature-photos-photo feature-photos-column""> \n<div class=""vox-photo-hack"">\n<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington#mediaviewer/File:A_Map_of_Washington%27s_Farms_at_Mt._Vernon_(1830_engraving).jpg"" target=""_black""><img class=""lazy zoom"" data-src=""http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/1406938/A_Map_of_Washington_s_Farms_at_Mt._Vernon__1830_engraving_.0.jpg""></a> <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington#mediaviewer/File:A_Map_of_Washington%27s_Farms_at_Mt._Vernon_(1830_engraving).jpg"" target=""_blank"" class=""icon-link-ext-alt""></a>\n</div> \n<p class=""feature-photos-caption""><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington#mediaviewer/File:A_Map_of_Washington%27s_Farms_at_Mt._Vernon_(1830_engraving).jpg""> George Washington </a></p> \n</div> \n<div class=""feature-photos-story feature-photos-column""> \n<h4>George Washington's Mount Vernon estate</h4> \n<p>Not even slightly coincidentally, the national capital district was located such that its ""10 miles square"" boundaries were very close to George Washington's massive plantation and estate near Mount Vernon, without including it per se. Major owners of land inside the district-to-be, notably David Burns who held 650 acres in what was to be the middle of the city, were not enthusiastic about the prospect of having their holdings appropriated for public purposes. But the creation of a new city along the Potomac greatly stimulated the value of nearby agricultural land.

Washington's Metrorail system is different, developed in the 1970s and 1980s during a massive national wave of disinvestment in urban centers. Consequently, the system's original incarnation was much more oriented toward taking suburban commuters to downtown offices than to building a vibrant city. It was not until the completion of the Green Line route from U Street to Fort Totten in 1999 that the densest residential sections of the city were even served. The system's completion has been associated with a massive wave of investment (and gentrification) in the city's central corridor that continues to roil city politics.</p> \n</div> \n</li> \n<li class=""list-5 clearfix feature-photos-list-item""> \n<div class=""feature-photos-photo feature-photos-column""> \n<div class=""vox-photo-hack"">\n<a href=""https://www.behance.net/gallery/Washington-Metro-Map-to-Scale/10965947"" target=""_black""><img class=""lazy zoom"" data-src=""http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2315654/iz2DBzXYlRwDz.0.png""></a> <a href=""https://www.behance.net/gallery/Washington-Metro-Map-to-Scale/10965947"" target=""_blank"" class=""icon-link-ext-alt""></a>\n</div> \n<p class=""feature-photos-caption""><a href=""https://www.behance.net/gallery/Washington-Metro-Map-to-Scale/10965947""> Peter Dovak </a></p> \n</div> \n<div class=""feature-photos-story feature-photos-column""> \n<h4>Geographically accurate Metro map</h4> \n<p>Riders normally see Metro depicted in a schematic designed to be highly readable and to lay out the logic of the system in a clear way.

The creators found that 44 percent of fundraisers occurred at just 10 different locations, all within a three-block radius of the Capitol. This politicking is, in one sense, the engine that drives the city.

What today we know as vibrant neighborhoods in Shaw, Dupont Circle, and U Street would have been turned into car-filled wastelands, and places like Columbia Heights, Mount Pleasant, and Bloomingdale would have been cut off from the central city. Such city-killing freeway projects were common in America at the time, but community opposition largely killed the idea. Funding was instead directed toward the construction of the Metro system in the 1970s as an alternative means of easing commutes from the suburbs into downtown. The fierce opposition was driven by both concerns regarded neighborhood preservation, and also a sense that whites were trying to drive African Americans out of the city. The specifics of the highway plan are a thing of the past, but the broader concerns about gentrification and ""the Plan"" to evict DC's black majority very much persist.</p> \n</div> \n</li> \n<li class=""list-10 clearfix feature-photos-list-item""> \n<div class=""feature-photos-photo feature-photos-column""> \n<div class=""vox-photo-hack"">\n<a href=""http://www.census.gov/dataviz/visualizations/019/"" target=""_black""><img class=""lazy zoom"" data-src=""http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2314786/Screen_Shot_2014-09-30_at_5.50.38_PM.0.png""></a> <a href=""http://www.census.gov/dataviz/visualizations/019/"" target=""_blank"" class=""icon-link-ext-alt""></a>\n</div> \n<p class=""feature-photos-caption""><a href=""http://www.census.gov/dataviz/visualizations/019/""> Census </a></p> \n</div> \n<div class=""feature-photos-story feature-photos-column""> \n<h4>The richest metro in America</h4> \n<p>It's an admittedly fairly arbitrary cutpoint, but a striking fact about the DC Metropolitan Area is that it contains four of the five counties in America with median household incomes above $102,000 a year (the other one is Los Alamos County in New Mexico, which is also full of federal workers and contractors). That's Arlington, Fairfax, and Loudoun Counties in Virginia, plus Howard County in Maryland. And these aren't tiny communities, either. They add up to millions of residents. Montgomery County, also in Maryland, comes very close to meeting the threshold, and even more modest suburban counties like Prince George's have median incomes that are well above the national average and at least somewhat higher than the average inside the city. This reflects the capital area's surprising emergence as the richest region in the United States of America — a dynamic that raises the specter of a parasitic capital living high off the work of its citizens, but that also throws the still-persistent poverty of the central city into stark relief.</p> \n</div> \n</li> \n</ol> \n<div class=""chorus-snippet m-fishtank no-responsive-video ad-thing-that-breaks-the-whole-page-crap-ugh""> \n<script type=""text/javascript""><!-- \nif (!window.OX_ads) { OX_ads = []; } OX_ads.push({ ""auid"" : ""550521"" }); \n// --></script> \n<script type=""text/javascript""><!-- \ndocument.write( '<scr'+'ipt src=""http://ox-d.sbnation.com/w/1.0/jstag""></scr'+'ipt>' ); \n// --></script> \n<noscript>&amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;iframe id=""5400be50c5072"" name=""5400be50c5072"" src=""http://ox-d.sbnation.com/w/1.0/afr?auid=550521&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE"" mce_src=""http://ox-d.sbnation.com/w/1.0/afr?auid=550521&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE"" frameborder=""0"" scrolling=""no"" width=""970"" height=""250""&amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;a href=""http://ox-d.sbnation.com/w/1.0/rc?cs=5400be50c5072&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE"" mce_href=""http://ox-d.sbnation.com/w/1.0/rc?cs=5400be50c5072&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE""&amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;img src=""http://ox-d.sbnation.com/w/1.0/ai?auid=550521&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;cs=5400be50c5072&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE"" mce_src=""http://ox-d.sbnation.com/w/1.0/ai?auid=550521&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;cs=5400be50c5072&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE"" border=""0"" alt=""""&amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;/a&amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;/iframe&amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;</noscript>\n</div> \n</div> \n<div class=""feature-photos-related clearfix""> \n<hr> \n<h3>Learn more</h3> \n<ul class=""feature-photos-related-list""> \n<li class=""feature-photos-related-list-item""> <a href=""http://www.vox.com/a/world-war-i-maps""> \n<div class=""feature-photos-related-image"" style=""background-image: url( 'http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/assets/4607979/img029a.jpg' );""></div> \n<div class=""feature-photos-related-highlight""></div> \n<div class=""feature-photos-related-headline"">40 maps that explain World War One</div> \n</a> </li> \n<li class=""feature-photos-related-list-item""> <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/9/15/6111911/41-maps-and-charts-that-explain-the-midwest""> \n<div class=""feature-photos-related-image"" style=""background-image: url( 'http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/38064126/shutterstock_137745083.0.0.jpg' );""></div> \n<div class=""feature-photos-related-highlight""></div> \n<div class=""feature-photos-related-headline"">41 maps and charts that explain the Midwest</div> \n</a> </li> \n<li class=""feature-photos-related-list-item""> <a href=""http://www.vox.com/a/maps-explain-the-middle-east""> \n<div class=""feature-photos-related-image"" style=""background-image: url( 'http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/assets/4238583/middle_east_night_sky.jpg' );""></div> \n<div class=""feature-photos-related-highlight""></div> \n<div class=""feature-photos-related-headline"">40 maps that explain the Middle East</div> \n</a> </li> \n</ul> \n</div> \n<p> \n<link href=""http://apps.voxmedia.com/tools/stylesheets/tools/features-public-list.css"" rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css""> \n<script src=""http://apps.voxmedia.com/tools/javascripts/tools/features-public-list.js"" type=""text/javascript""></script> \n<link href=""http://apps.voxmedia.com/tools/stylesheets/sites/vox.css"" media=""screen"" rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css""> \n<script src=""http://apps.voxmedia.com/tools/javascripts/sites/vox.js"" type=""text/javascript""></script> \n</p>",Transportation

In many markets where it was operating, it was violating the letter of the law. And in essentially all markets where it was operating, it was violating the spirit of the law. That's because the ""spirit"" of the prevailing taxi regulations was, almost everywhere, wrong and pernicious. Alongside regulations aimed at promoting public safety, almost every city and state is burdened with rules designed to protect the incomes of incumbent taxi license holders.</p> \n<p>Uber's business was (and is) to destroy the value of those licenses by opening up the rides-for-hire market to a potentially unlimited supply of vehicles and drivers.</p> \n<p>It's a perfectly <a href=""http://www.vox.com/xpress/2014/9/30/6873389/uber-economists-poll-consumer-welfare-efficiency"">good idea for the world</a>, but you never could have gotten it off the ground by asking permission first. Even where Uber's business didn't violate existing rules, it undermined the (pernicious) purpose of those rules and rules could always be changed to exclude it. Consequently, the company benefitted enormously from a ""shoot first, ask questions later"" mindset.</p> \n<p>But dispositions that are functional and useful in one context can become rancid in another. A conviction that the rules don't (or shouldn't) apply to you is fine when you're battling a taxi mogul who <a href=""http://www.vox.com/xpress/2014/10/29/7091615/alex-friedman-uber-isis"">compares your business to ISIS</a>. But it's extremely unattractive when you start talking about compromising customer user data for the purposes of blackmail. And it's completely insane when that kind of recklessness leads you to talk to journalists about the oppo tactics you're planning to deploy against other journalists.</p> \n<h3>Time for Uber to grow up</h3> \n<p>As Uber gets bigger and more established, its executives can look less like brash upstarts and more like assholes. Moves like <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/8/19/6045597/plouffe-uber-taxi-companies-spend-more"">hiring former top Obama advisor David Plouffe</a>, show that the company is hardly on the outside looking in. It has a <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/6/7/5788558/why-uber-just-might-be-worth-it-at-18-billion"">valuation of $18 billion</a>, and clear aspirations to move beyond the ride business to a broader array of ""urban logistics"" operations.</p> \n<p>That's all great. But to succeed at that level, the company needs to grow up.</p> \n<p>Users really are entrusting the company with a lot of personal information about their comings and goings. If Uber wants to play a broader role in customers' lives, the volume of data available to the company will grow even further. Privacy concerns are nothing new in the digital economy. But serious players try to take them seriously. If executives from Google even suggested for a minute that the company might use its trove of data to blackmail enemies, the whole enterprise would be at risk of regulatory vaporization — and rightly so.</p> \n<p>The vision of free entry into the rides-for-hire market is appealing, and it took a certain devil-may-care attitude to get it off the ground. But it <i>is</i> off the ground now. Uber is a major company. And it's time to start acting like it. Not all rules are made to be broken. The fact that Michaels is getting a kind of verbal scolding rather than suffering real consequences suggests that maybe the company's board and CEO still don't get that.</p>",Transportation

It's that he runs a company with a ton of information about its users.

The broader problem is that Michael's comments actually seem perfectly consistent with Uber's values — as demonstrated by the company's actions.</p> \n<p><span>This is a company with a famously cavalier attitude toward its customers' privacy.

When it’s anonymous, it’s a cool trick. But Julia Allison, an attendee at a launch party in Chicago in September 2011, says Uber treated guests to Creepy Stalker View, showing them the whereabouts and movements of 30 Uber users in New York in real time. She recognized half of the people listed and texted one of them, entrepreneur Peter Sims, revealing that she knew his current whereabouts.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>And this isn't the only time Uber has been accused of misusing private information about its customers. Buzzfeed <a href=""http://www.buzzfeed.com/bensmith/uber-executive-suggests-digging-up-dirt-on-journalists"" target=""_blank"">says</a> that ""the general manager of Uber NYC accessed the profile of a BuzzFeed News reporter, Johana Bhuiyan, to make points in the course of a discussion of Uber policies. At no point in the email exchanges did she give him permission to do so.""</p> \n<p>This kind of casual disregard for user privacy becomes particularly ominous when we remember that Uber is popular with some of the most powerful members of our society.

But policies are only as trustworthy as the people enforcing them. When an Uber executive openly muses about intimidating reporters with sensitive personal information, that's a sign that he might not be sufficiently committed to ethical behavior to be a senior executive at a powerful company like Uber. And the fact that Kalanick sat silently through Michael's comments, and then chose not to fire him when the comments became public, suggests he might not take ethical considerations seriously enough, either.</p> \n<p>It's also worth talking about whether Uber's customers should have legally enforceable rights protecting the privacy of their travel data. Most other organizations that hold sensitive customer data — health care providers, universities, telecommunications companies, even video rental stores — are subject to regulations on their use of private customer data. The data Uber collects is at least as sensitive as peoples' academic transcripts or video rental history. Perhaps travel data should have the same kinds of legal protections.</p> \n<p><b>Update</b>: In a <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://blog.uber.com/privacypolicy"">new blog post</a>, Uber says its privacy policy strictly limits employee access to customer data.</p>",Transportation
"The latest Uber scandal, explained",http://www.vox.com/2014/11/19/7248819/uber-scandal-explained,An Uber executive mused about hiring a team to dig up dirt on critical journalists. Here's what you need to know.,"<p>Uber is currently facing controversy for comments suggesting the company might hire researchers to dig up dirt about reporters who have been critical of the company. The incident seems to reinforce two long-standing criticisms of the company: that it has a misogynistic culture, and that it has too little respect for privacy.</p> \n<h3>Why are people upset at Uber?</h3> \n<p>The current controversy started on Monday, when Buzzfeed editor Ben Smith <a href=""http://www.buzzfeed.com/bensmith/uber-executive-suggests-digging-up-dirt-on-journalists"">wrote about</a> attending a dinner organized by an Uber consultant. The guests included celebrities such as the actor Edward Norton and media executive Arianna Huffington.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""right""><span>Michael singled out Sarah Lacy, editor of the technology site Pando Daily, as a potential target</span></q></p> \n<p>During the dinner, Uber executive Emil Michael mused (in Smith's words) about ""hiring a team of opposition researchers to dig up dirt on its critics in the media.""</p> \n<p>According to Smith, Michael singled out Sarah Lacy, editor of the technology site Pando Daily, as a potential target for this kind of snooping. Lacy is an Uber critic; last month she wrote an article called <a href=""http://pando.com/2014/10/22/the-horrific-trickle-down-of-asshole-culture-at-a-company-like-uber/"">""The horrific trickle down of Asshole culture,""</a> arguing that Uber has a misogynistic culture that puts women at risk as drivers and passengers. Lacy said she was deleting her Uber app in protest over Uber's failure to take steps to safeguard women's safety. Here's how Smith described Michael's comments:</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>Michael expressed outrage at Lacy’s column and said that women are far more likely to get assaulted by taxi drivers than Uber drivers. He said that he thought Lacy should be held ""personally responsible"" for any woman who followed her lead in deleting Uber and was then sexually assaulted.</p> \n<p>Then he returned to the opposition research plan. Uber’s dirt-diggers, Michael said, could expose Lacy. They could, in particular, prove a particular and very specific claim about her personal life.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>These ideas were purely hypothetical. Michael didn't indicate that he was planning to actually carry out his plan.</p> \n<p>Smith was invited to the dinner by journalist Michael Wolff. In a <a href=""http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/columnist/wolff/2014/11/19/behind-the-scenes-uber-buzzfeed-fracas/19269737/"">Wednesday column</a> about the incident, Wolff argued that Smith should have checked with him about the off-the-record nature of the event. He also argued that Smith's account is misleading, as it implies that Michael's comments were directed at the entire group rather than just Smith himself.</p> \n<h3>Why has the incident generated so much attention?</h3> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""2472550"" alt=""454834484.0.jpg"" src=""http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2472550/454834484.0.jpg""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">(Evelyn Hockstein/For The Washington Post via Getty Images)</p> \n<p>Obviously, any powerful business executive would face a backlash for making comments like these. But the comments have attracted particular attention because they fit into an existing story about Uber's culture.</p> \n<p>Uber's corporate culture has always been tolerant of breaking rules in order to succeed. Indeed, this culture was probably <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/11/18/7240295/uber-privacy"">essential to Uber's success</a>; without it, Uber probably wouldn't have been able to break up the cartels that controlled the taxi business in most American cities. But a growing number of critics have been arguing that Uber's macho culture has a dark side.</p> \n<p>Michael's comments reinforced two specific criticisms that people had already been making about Uber. One is that the company has a misogynistic culture that causes it to under-invest in protecting the safety of women who use Uber as drivers and passengers. Uber has been accused of having <a href=""http://valleywag.gawker.com/uber-driver-heres-how-we-get-around-background-checks-1596982249"">lax procedures</a> for checking potential drivers' backgrounds, and for <a href=""http://valleywag.gawker.com/uber-ceo-on-driver-assault-its-not-real-and-were-n-1323533057"">not taking assault allegations seriously</a>.</p> \n<p>Critics have also raised concerns about Uber's commitment to customer privacy. Uber has been accused of using a screen called ""God view"" to <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/kashmirhill/2014/10/03/god-view-uber-allegedly-stalked-users-for-party-goers-viewing-pleasure/"">show the locations of prominent Uber customers</a> at parties. Buzzfeed reporter Johana Bhuiyan says that an Uber executive <a href=""http://www.buzzfeed.com/johanabhuiyan/uber-is-investigating-its-top-new-york-executive-for-privacy"">accessed information</a> about the use of Uber without asking permission. Bhuiyan reported that ""two former Uber employees, both of whom worked at the company until this spring and requested anonymity, said that God View was easily accessible to staff across the company.""</p> \n<h3>How has Uber responded?</h3> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""2472554"" alt=""458117508.0.jpg"" src=""http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2472554/458117508.0.jpg""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Travis Kalanick. (Barry Chin/The Boston Globe via Getty Images)</p> \n<p>Clumsily. Michael says he didn't know the comments were on the record (Smith says he wasn't told the dinner was off the record until afterward). Michael told Buzzfeed that he regretted the comments and that ""they didn’t reflect his or the company’s views.""</p> \n<p>After Lacy <a href=""http://pando.com/2014/11/17/the-moment-i-learned-just-how-far-uber-will-go-to-silence-journalists-and-attack-women/"">wrote a post</a> about the incident, Michael called her and asked to speak to her off the record. When she insisted that their conversation be on the record, he hung up and <a href=""http://pando.com/2014/11/17/the-moment-i-learned-just-how-far-uber-will-go-to-silence-journalists-and-attack-women/"">sent her an apology</a> by email instead.</p> \n<p>The day after Smith published his story, Uber CEO Travis Kalanick <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/11/18/7242761/Uber-Travis-Kalanick-comments"">made a statement</a> about the incident on Twitter. He said Michaels's comments were ""terrible and do not represent the company,"" and that the comments ""showed a lack of leadership, a lack of humanity, and a departure from our values and ideals.""</p> \n<h3>Yikes!

Google's self-driving car has a new look.

No steering wheel. No pedals. Just sit back and let the car navigate.</p> \n<p>But at the time, Google only offered a mock-up. This week, via Greg Kumparak of TechCrunch, <a href=""http://techcrunch.com/2014/12/22/heres-what-googles-first-custom-built-self-driving-car-looks-like-now/"">they've released a photo</a> of the actual prototype — with a subtle new look. I've put both images into a slider to make it easier to see the differences <span>between the mock-up (black) and finished vehicle (white):</span></p> \n<p> </p> \n<p> </p> \n<div class=""image-compare-tool ICT-vox""> \n<div class=""image-compare-images""> \n<div class=""image-compare-bottom""><img src=""https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2873948/v2.0.png""></div> \n<div class=""image-compare-top""><img src=""https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2873946/v1.0.png""></div> \n</div> \n</div> \n<p>The big differences are the headlights and the slimmed down radar/camera on top of the car (how the car sees the world). Now that a prototype is built, Google will start testing it on the tracks — and could send it out on roads in California by 2015.</p> \n<h3>Will Google's self-driving car ever catch on?</h3> \n<p><span>Self-driving cars are an intriguing possibility, to say the least. If they ever became widespread, traffic jams and deadly crashes could become rarities and commuting could become far less stressful. (On the other hand, self-driving cars could also have a number of downsides — like layoffs for the nation's millions of truckers and taxi drivers. Here's </span><a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/5/28/5756736/the-case-for-self-driving-cars"" target=""_blank"">a more detailed rundown</a><span> of some of the potential pros and cons.)</span></p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""right"">Tesla is taking a different approach toward self-driving vehicles</q></p> \n<p>But that said, self-driving cars still face plenty of <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/10/23/heres-what-it-would-take-for-self-driving-cars-to-catch-on/"" style=""font-size: 17px; line-height: 28.4624996185303px; background-color: #ffffff;"">legal and regulatory hurdles</a><span> — and it's not even clear that Google's version will win out. Right now, a number of auto companies are experimenting with self-driving vehicles in California, which has begun to allow road tests. And there are a couple different approaches here.</span></p> \n<p><span>Tesla Motors, for its part, seems to be focusing </span><a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/10/10/6955739/tesla-d-elon-musk-AWD-autonomous-parking"" target=""_blank"">on adding incremental ""autopilot"" capacities</a><span> to its existing line of popular vehicles. The company's newest </span><span>Model S cars will be able to change lanes on their own, obey speed-limit signs, and even park themselves — while being handled by drivers the rest of the time. As the tech advances, the hope is that these cars will get so many self-driving capabilities that they'll be able to drive themselves one day.</span></p> \n<p><span>Google, by contrast, is opting to build a car from scratch that eliminates driver control altogether — rather than slowly adding autonomous capabilities over time. (After all, there's a good argument that switching back and forth between a computer driver and half-attentive human driver </span><a href=""http://www.technologyreview.com/view/518856/are-driverless-cars-really-just-around-the-corner/"">is actually more dangerous</a><span> than just letting the computer do all the work.) The downside of Google's approach is that its initial vehicle can seem unimpressive — it only travels 25 miles per hour and can't run on highways.</span></p> \n<p>In either case, the technology is still quite pricey — Tesla's Model S starts at $71,000 — and the US is still a long ways away from making all the regulatory and licensing changes necessary to make self-driving cars a reality. But the technology is clearly getting better and better with each passing year.</p> \n<h3>Further reading on self-driving cars</h3> \n<p><b></b>15 ways that self-driving cars<a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/5/28/5756736/the-case-for-self-driving-cars""> could transform our lives</a></p> \n<p><span>Driverless cars will mean </span><a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/5/28/5758560/driverless-cars-will-mean-the-end-of-car-ownership"">the end of mass car ownership</a></p> \n<p>One big obstacle to self-driving cars? <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/7/31/5955141/one-big-obstacle-for-self-driving-cars-people-are-still-scared-of-them"">People are still scared of them</a>.</p> \n<p>Why trucks<a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/6/3/5775482/why-trucks-will-drive-themselves-before-cars-do""> will drive themselves</a> before cars do</p> \n<p> \n<link href=""http://apps.voxmedia.com/tools/stylesheets/tools/image-slider-public-b9271013.css"" media=""all"" rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css""> \n<script src=""http://apps.voxmedia.com/tools/javascripts/tools/image-slider-public-a2152966.js""></script> \n</p>",Transportation
Your next car will be an extension of your smartphone,http://www.vox.com/2015/1/7/7508085/car-smartphone-carplay-ces,"At this week's Consumer Electronics Show, automakers are showing off better smartphone integration and powerful new self-driving capabilities.","<p>Cars haven't traditionally been considered part of the consumer electronics industry. But as you can see at this week's Consumer Electronics Show, that's changing. Car companies have flocked to Las Vegas to announce more powerful dashboard computers, better integration with smartphones, and more sophisticated self-driving capabilities.</p> \n<p>As computers become more deeply woven into every aspect of our lives, cars are becoming just another gadget — albeit the biggest and most expensive one you'll ever own.</p> \n<h3>Automakers are building fancier dashboard computers</h3> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2911912/bmw-touch-command-003-1020.0.0.jpg"" alt=""bmw-touch-command-003-1020.0.0.jpg"" data-chorus-asset-id=""2911912""></p> \n<p> </p> \n<p class=""caption"">(The Verge)</p> \n<p> </p> \n<p>Our cars have had computers in them for decades. Your car probably has built-in computers that optimize fuel consumption and manage features like airbags and antilock brakes. These computers are what engineers call embedded computers — devices without any type of user interface (although you can talk to them with <a href=""https://www.automatic.com/?gclid=COW9z-r6gMMCFSgV7Aod_xQAyA"">third-party smartphone apps</a>).</p> \n<p>A more recent development has been computers with touchscreen user interfaces. These are generally mounted in the center console and support functions such as navigation and playing music. At CES, a number of car companies announced improvements to these dashboard computer systems.</p> \n<p>BMW has been working on improving iDrive, the touchscreen computing platform that controls settings in recent BMW vehicles. At CES, the company <a href=""http://www.theverge.com/2015/1/6/7499437/bmw-touch-command-tablet-samsung-gestures-ces-2015"">showed off</a> a prototype of a camera mounted in the car's roof that will allow BMW vehicles to pick up drivers' gestures and convert those into commands like turning up the volume or answering a call. The firm also showed off a custom Android tablet that could be integrated into the seat back of future BMW vehicles.</p> \n<p>Chevrolet <a href=""http://www.theverge.com/2014/1/5/5276536/cars-are-the-new-smartphones-chevrolet-adding-lte-and-app-store-to-2015-models"">announced</a> that its 2015 vehicles will come with advanced LTE wireless capabilities and a proprietary app store called the App Shop. That will give the vehicles advanced wireless capabilities and the ability to install new software, but it will also have a downside: your car will need a separate data plan. Chevy says it's partnering with AT&amp;T to provide connectivity, but it hasn't gotten into specifics about what plans will be available and how much they'll cost.</p> \n<h3>Smartphones are taking over</h3> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2911906/ios-carplay.0.jpg"" alt=""ios-carplay.0.jpg"" data-chorus-asset-id=""2911906""></p> \n<p> </p> \n<p class=""caption"">(Apple)</p> \n<p> </p> \n<p>Apple and Google have a different vision for the future of in-car computing: they want their smartphone platforms to totally replace these proprietary systems.</p> \n<p>Last year, Google and Apple each introduced new platforms, called <a href=""http://www.android.com/auto/"">Android Auto</a> and <a href=""https://www.apple.com/ios/carplay/"">CarPlay</a>, respectively. The key idea is to outsource the brains of that in-dash touchscreen to your smartphone. That means you get the same polished interface that powers iPhones and Android smartphones, and these capabilities will improve as smartphones get more powerful.</p> \n<p>There haven't been a lot of big announcements from carmakers about these platforms at CES, but that's because almost all of the major car companies pledged support last year. An exception was Volkswagen, which skipped Apple's CarPlay announcement last year but <a href=""http://www.theverge.com/2015/1/5/7496835/carplay-and-android-auto-will-be-in-volkswagen-cars-this-year-ces-2015"">announced Monday</a> that it would support both standards. Other automakers such as Hyundai are <a href=""http://www.cnet.com/news/hyundai-showing-android-auto-apple-carplay-integration-at-ces-2015/"">showing off</a> their support for the standards.</p> \n<p>There's every indication carmakers are adopting these platforms grudgingly. They recognize that they'll be at a competitive disadvantage if they don't provide seamless integration with the two dominant smartphone platforms. But they'd much rather consumers use proprietary systems like BMW's iDrive, which give the car companies more control over the user experience.</p> \n<p>If you're excited about CarPlay and Android Auto but don't want to buy a new car, you're in luck. At CES multiple vendors have announced aftermarket devices that support the standard. Parrot, for example, is offering a <a href=""http://www.theverge.com/2015/1/4/7491577/parrot-rnb6-smartcar-screen-apple-carplay-android-auto-ces-2015"">touchscreen unit</a> that supports both Android and iOS devices and will fit in most cars currently on the roads. Pioneer is also <a href=""http://www.theverge.com/2015/1/6/7500829/pioneer-head-units-carplay-android-auto-ces-2015"">offering</a> a range of car stereo systems with support for both platforms.</p> \n<h3>Self-driving technology is closer than you think</h3> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2911902/news-audi-2015-piloted-driving-from-silicon-valley-to-las-vegas-24.0.0.jpeg"" alt=""news-audi-2015-piloted-driving-from-silicon-valley-to-las-vegas-24.0.0.jpeg"" data-chorus-asset-id=""2911902""></p> \n<p> </p> \n<p class=""caption"">The inside of Audi's self-driving car. (Audi)</p> \n<p> </p> \n<p>People usually think about self-driving cars as a technology that's still many years in the future. And fully self-driving vehicles might be a ways off. But car companies are already hard at work on cars with partial self-driving capabilities that can be brought to the market more quickly.</p> \n<p>In a sense, the gradual roll-out of self-driving cars has already started. You can already buy cars that can <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_Parking_Assist_System"">park themselves</a> and <a href=""http://www.theverge.com/2012/7/3/3134472/highway-loss-data-institute-automated-safety-system-survey"">help you avoid collisions</a>. More advanced technology will become commercially available in the next few years.</p> \n<p>For example, BMW is demoing a prototype of a sophisticated collision prevention system at CES, and the Verge's Chris Zeigler <a href=""http://www.theverge.com/2015/1/5/7494989/bmw-i3-self-parking-anti-collision-ces-2015"">got a test drive</a>. BMW representatives encouraged Zeigler to try his hardest to crash the car, but it wouldn't cooperate. If he tried to speed toward a wall, the car would detect the obstacle and come to a smooth stop just before he hit it. If Zeigler tried to take a corner too sharply, the car managed to come to a halt before side-swiping the obstacle and scraping up the vehicle. The car also had a valet function that will park it without anyone inside. BMW <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/aarontilley/2015/01/06/bmws-self-driving-car-parks-itself-and-picks-you-up-when-youre-ready-to-go/"">estimates</a> the technology will be commercially available in five to eight years.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, Audi <a href=""http://www.theverge.com/2015/1/6/7499581/audi-self-driving-car-a7-ces-2015"">announced</a> that it drove an A7 from San Francisco to Las Vegas using a prototype of ""Piloted Driving,"" a technology that falls somewhere between cruise control and full self-driving. When Piloted Driving mode is turned on, the A7 can handle most freeway driving situations without human intervention, but it alerts the driver to take over when it gets to city streets. Audi <a href=""http://www.audiusa.com/newsroom/news/press-releases/2015/01/550-mile-piloted-drive-from-silicon-valley-to-las-vegas"">describes the technology</a> as ""production ready,"" but it hasn't announced a specific release date.</p> \n<p>Perhaps the most optimistic take on self-driving cars came from Ford CEO Mark Fields, who <a href=""http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2015-01-06/ford-ceo-fields-predicts-driverless-cars-on-roads-in-five-years.html"">predicted</a> that someone will introduce a fully self-driving car in the next five years. Fields said that Ford probably wouldn't be the first company to introduce the technology, in part because the technology will be too expensive for Ford's mainstream customer base. But it's now widely accepted in the auto industry that self-driving cars are coming. The only question is how long it will take.</p>",Transportation
Hamburg is burying the Autobahn and putting parks on top,http://www.vox.com/2015/1/9/7520805/hamburg-highway,The main goal: eliminating noise pollution.,"<p>The <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundesautobahn_7"">Autobahn 7</a>, Germany's longest highway, runs straight through Hamburg. Over the years, it's grown more and more congested, now carrying about <a href=""http://www.rehau.com/group-en/corporate-information/press/customer-magazine/furniture-solutions-19/major-project"">152,000 cars and trucks</a> per day.</p> \n<p>To deal with the increasing traffic, the city is turning to a <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/10/23/6994159/traffic-roads-induced-demand"">pretty conventional solution</a>: widening virtually the entire stretch of the highway that runs through the city.</p> \n<p>But to deal with the noise — and the way that the highway has severed neighborhoods that were connected before it was built in the 1980s — <a href=""http://www.fastcoexist.com/3040310/theyre-going-to-bury-a-stretch-of-german-autobahn-and-cover-it-in-parks#1"">Fast Company reports</a> that the city has come to a pretty interesting solution: they're burying a few miles of the highway and covering it with parks, community gardens, and housing development.</p> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""2919534"" alt=""autobahn 2"" src=""https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2919534/3040310-inline-i-2-parts-of-this-german-autobahn-will-soon-131017stell14portalnord-copy.0.jpg""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">(<a href=""http://www.hamburg.de/contentblob/4324620/data/praesentation-infomobil.pdf"">City of Hamburg</a>)</p> \n<p>The project, which is called the <a href=""http://streetswithoutcars.wordpress.com/2014/08/22/the-hamburger-deckel/"">Hamburger Deckel</a> and is projected to cost $800 million, comes after 20 years of lobbying from a local residents' initiative called ""Ohne Dach ist Krach"" (German for ""No Roof, Too Much Racket""). Burying the highway is a practical way to meet a city noise abatement ordinance passed in 2005, as the sound barriers built in most places (including virtually everywhere in the US) can only cut down on noise by a factor of <a href=""https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/environment/noise/noise_barriers/design_construction/keepdown.cfm"">about half</a>.</p> \n<p>The tunnel project also has some other benefits: in covering what will be an eight-lane freeway, it'll provide a substantial amount of new parkland, along with space to build a neighborhood of 1700 homes. At its northern end, the new park will also link existing parkland, establishing a new greenbelt. Work is starting this year, and it's projected to be finished in 2022.</p> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""2919536"" alt=""autobahn 3"" src=""https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2919536/Screen_Shot_2015-01-09_at_11.44.49_AM.0.png""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">(<a href=""http://www.hochtief-solutions.com/solutions_en/51.jhtml?p=301&amp;s=20"">HOCHTIEF Solutions</a>)</p> \n<p>Of course, there's also another solution to eliminating traffic noise: tearing out urban highways entirely. In the US, Seattle is <a href=""http://grist.org/cities/seattles-unbelievable-transportation-megaproject-fustercluck/"">burying a downtown waterfront highway</a> at a cost of $4.2 billion (and counting), and there's a pretty good case to be made that the city <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/12/22/7435377/case-against-urban-freeways"">would have been better off removing the highway</a> and replacing it with parks or pedestrian-friendly development.</p> \n<p>But there are significant differences between the Hamburg and Seattle projects. One is that the Autobahn 7 is a crucial national highway that carries lots of traffic across the country — something that isn't true for Seattle's Alaskan Way Viaduct — making it much harder to tear down without major disruptions.</p> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""2919544"" alt=""autobahn 4"" src=""https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2919544/Screen_Shot_2015-01-09_at_11.44.58_AM.0.png""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">(<a href=""http://www.hochtief-solutions.com/solutions_en/51.jhtml?p=301&amp;s=20"">HOCHTIEF Solutions</a>)</p> \n<p>Additionally, Hamburg's project is less ambitious, in an engineering sense. Its highway is simply being slightly lowered, with a six-to-ten foot cap placed on top of it. Seattle is taking on the huge challenge of digging the widest deep-bore tunnel ever, 120 feet underground — which explains why the boring machine got stuck last year, halting construction until April at soonest and leading to cost over-runs.</p> \n<p><strong>Further reading</strong>:</p> \n<ul> \n<li><a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/12/29/7460557/urban-freeway-slider-maps"">Before-and-after maps show how freeways transformed America's cities</a></li> \n<li><a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/12/22/7435377/case-against-urban-freeways"">The case for tearing down urban freeways</a></li> \n<li><a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/10/23/6994159/traffic-roads-induced-demand"">The ""fundamental rule"" of traffic: building new roads just makes people drive more</a></li> \n</ul>",Transportation

If the turn-by-turn directions tell you to turn left at an intersection where lefts are forbidden, for instance, you can report the problem, and engineers at Google's <a href=""https://developers.google.com/events/io/sessions/383278298"">Project Ground Truth</a> will adjust their data accordingly.</p> \n<p>In <a href=""http://www.wsj.com/video/here-a-thing-google-maps-secret-weapon/45F0C2AC-F9FE-40F4-9156-4B561DB2DDB4.html"">this new video</a> (above), the Wall Street Journal's Christopher Mims dug up an interesting fact about this system: cyclists contribute disproportionately more complaints than anyone else. Google hasn't released hard data, but told Mims that cyclists are ""fanatical"" contributors to the system.</p> \n<p>Mims suggests two main reasons why this might be. One is that cyclists use both roads and trails — so, in theory, they're able to notice a broader range of Google Maps errors. Additionally, he points out that a mapping error that puts a cyclist on an especially busy road endangers their safety in a way that it doesn't for a driver, making them much more likely to report the error.</p> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""3453674"" alt=""google maps bikes"" src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3453674/Screen_Shot_2015-02-27_at_1.26.30_PM.0.png""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Google Maps' bicycling directions, in Manhattan. (Google)</p> \n<p>These explanations both make a lot of sense. But I think there are a few additional factors involved:</p> \n<p>1) Google's biking directions are great — but they're notoriously unreliable. They're much newer than the driving directions, and Google simply doesn't have as much data to go off when determining what's a realistic bike route and what isn't. Thus, more errors to point out.</p> \n<p>2) Cyclists don't just experience more danger than drivers when directions are wrong — they expend more effort. And an error that requires you to ride a lot farther (say, a map that makes it seem possible to ride from a bike path to a road, when in fact they don't connect) would make you much more likely to report an error than one that makes you drive an extra few minutes in a car.</p> \n<p>3) Someone on a bike has more opportunities to immediately report an error (before they forget) than someone in a car. After being thwarted by bad directions, for instance, a cyclist can report it while resting by the side of a bike trail or road. A driver, on the other hand, typically has to immediately merge back into traffic or decide where to turn next.</p> \n<p><strong>Read more: </strong><a href=""http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/09/how-google-builds-its-maps-and-what-it-means-for-the-future-of-everything/261913/"">How Google Builds Its Maps — and What It Means for the Future of Everything</a></p>",Transportation

"A California resident says Google's autonomous cars ""drive like your grandma""",http://www.vox.com/2015/6/1/8700459/google-self-driving-cars,What it's like to share the road with autonomous cars.,"<p>Google <a href=""http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2014/04/the-latest-chapter-for-self-driving-car.html"">has been testing its self-driving cars</a> all over Mountain View, California — which means that a handful of drivers have already gotten a firsthand look at what it's like to share the road with them.</p> \n<p>Recently, an anonymous reader <a href=""http://www.wearobo.com/2015/05/californians-are-ok-with-google-self.html"">of the blog Emerging Technologies</a> shared what it's like to deal with these cars in traffic. Here are a handful of the most interesting observations:</p> \n<p><strong>1) People in Mountain View are totally used to Google's cars.</strong></p> \n<p>The reader estimated seeing at least five of the cars daily.</p> \n<p>""Other drivers don't even blink when they see one,"" the author wrote. ""Neither do pedestrians — there's no ""fear"" from the general public about crashing or getting run over, at least not as far as I can tell.""</p> \n<p><!--  ########  BEGIN SNIPPET  ########  --></p> \n<div class=""chorus-snippet s-related"" data-analytics-action=""link:related"" data-analytics-category=""article"">\n<span class=""s-related__title"">Related</span> <!-- Add links here --><a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/5/28/5756736/the-case-for-self-driving-cars"">15 ways that self-driving cars could transform our lives</a>\n</div> \n<p><strong>2) Google's cars drive really, really cautiously.</strong></p> \n<p>""Google cars drive like your grandma — they're never the first off the line at a stop light, they don't accelerate quickly, they don't speed, and they never take any chances with lane changes (cut people off, etc.),"" the author wrote.</p> \n<p>The author described a Google car's behavior when making a turn at a stop sign with little visibility to the left or right: it inches out very gradually, with lots of halting pauses, rather than just slowly gliding forward into traffic as most human drivers tend to do.</p> \n<p>Similarly, the autonomous cars are extremely courteous with pedestrians, waiting a few seconds after they've completely cleared a crosswalk before inching out to make a turn through it. All this caution actually leads human drivers to occasionally get annoyed at Google cars, as they can excessively slow down traffic.</p> \n<p><strong>3) Human drivers might take advantage of these self-driving cars.</strong></p> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3745772/googlecar-e1401261602733.0.jpg"" alt=""google car"" data-chorus-asset-id=""3745772""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Google's newer self-driving car design, which has no steering wheel or pedals. Most of the cars currently on the road are still the retrofitted Lexus SUVs. (Google)</p> \n<p>One of the author's more interesting observations is what happened after he or she intentionally cut off the Google car as an experiment:</p> \n<p>""The car handled it perfectly (maybe too perfectly). It slowed down and let me in,"" the author wrote. ""Honestly, I don't think it will take long for other drivers to realize that self-driving cars are 'easy targets' in traffic.""</p> \n<p>In other words, drivers will realize that a self-driving car won't try to squeeze you out, tailgate you, or otherwise react angrily if you cut it off. Ultimately, this could lead human drivers to take advantage — perhaps going ahead of their turn at four-way stops, or merging into the front of a long line of stopped highway traffic because they know a self-driving car will let them in.</p> \n<p>In a <a href=""http://www.theverge.com/2015/4/24/8489881/ford-mike-tinskey-electric-vehicles-infrastructure-interview"">recent interview with The Verge</a>, Ford executive Mike Tinskey noted that these sorts of situations might actually make it useful for humans to have the ability to occasionally take control:</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>If you’ve ever had the pleasure to go to, for instance, China, if you’re not aggressive to try to turn left, there will be people that will walk in front of you all day long. And an autonomous vehicle would end up sitting there forever. And a driver normally just has to kind of say, ""Alright, I’m going,"" and the people will stop and the car heads through. So there are going to be situations where a remote driver can actually pilot a vehicle better than an autonomous in certain conditions.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p><strong>4) Google's cars seem really safe.</strong></p> \n<p>""Overall, I would say that I'm impressed with how these things operate. I actually do feel safer around a self-driving car than most other California drivers,"" the blog post author wrote.</p> \n<p>This fits in with the data we have on the cars so far. Though they've been involved in <a href=""http://www.theverge.com/2015/5/11/8586661/google-self-driving-car-11-accidents-not-at-fault"">11 minor fender benders</a> over the course of more than 700,000 miles of travel, none of them were actually the cars' fault — and in fact, <a href=""https://medium.com/backchannel/the-view-from-the-front-seat-of-the-google-self-driving-car-46fc9f3e6088"">Google has detailed many situations</a> in which its cars managed to avoid accidents after human drivers made extremely unsafe errors, like driving on the wrong side of the highway.</p> \n<p>So far, at least, Google has smartly prioritized excessively safe travel instead of designing its cars to have human-like aggressiveness. It'll be interesting to see how this works if the cars spread beyond Mountain View.</p> \n<p>Hat tip to <a href=""http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2015/05/google-cars-drives-like-your-grandma.html"">Alex Tabarrok at Marginal Revolution</a> for spotting the post.</p>",Transportation

Then he calculated the percentage of roads within each area that had a bendyness ratio close to 1 (indicating a perfectly straight road), and mapped the results, giving more weight to roads that were longer.</p> \n<p>The maps aren't perfect, McCann notes, as OpenStreetMap lacks some road data, especially in developing countries. In some cases, the data also splits curving roads into many short, straight lengths.</p> \n<p>Still, the project came to some pretty interesting conclusions that agree with our experience, at least in the Midwest.

"Once seniors are too old to drive, our transportation system totally fails them",http://www.vox.com/2015/6/12/8768827/seniors-aging-car-driving,An overlooked cost of suburban sprawl.,"<p>A few years ago, my grandfather gave up his car.</p> \n<p>During the early years of his retirement, he'd been very active, volunteering at the local library and chauffeuring older folks who couldn't drive themselves. Over time, he slowed down, but remained independent — so much so that after a year or so in a retirement home, he stubbornly moved back into his own apartment. Though he was in his 80s, he didn't like the idea of being surrounded by — as he put it — ""old people.""</p> \n<p>Eventually, his health declined to the point where it really wasn't safe for him to drive anymore. And though he used to take long walks daily, he could no longer traverse the vast parking lots and six-lane arterial roads surrounding his suburban Maryland apartment.</p> \n<p><q class=""right"" aria-hidden=""true"">""As people have aged in the suburbs, they've been left behind""</q></p> \n<p>Ultimately, he ended up largely stuck at home, entirely dependent on family to bring him food, give him rides, and provide simple human contact. In his final years, the car-based transportation system he'd relied on for his whole life really failed him.</p> \n<p>His story is shared by millions of other American seniors, <a href=""http://assets.aarp.org/rgcenter/il/beyond_50_communities.pdf"">about 80 percent</a> of whom live outside of urban areas. ""As people have aged in the suburbs, they've been left behind,"" says <a href=""http://www.iidc.indiana.edu/index.php?pageId=44&amp;mode=mod_md&amp;action=display_detail&amp;md_id=29"">Phil Stafford</a>, director of Indiana University's <a href=""http://www.iidc.indiana.edu/?pageId=31"">Center on Aging and Community</a>.</p> \n<p>And the problem is growing. Americans are getting older: <a href=""http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/00000.html"">14 percent</a> are currently over the age of 65, and that's expected to <a href=""http://www.census.gov/prod/2014pubs/p25-1140.pdf"">surpass 20 percent by 2030</a>. Modern medicine has extended people's lifespans — and people are <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/1/11/7517211/end-of-life-care"">spending more years with less physical independence</a>. And yet a smaller percentage of seniors move in with family or to retirement homes than in the past.</p> \n<p>""This is an unintended consequence of car-oriented planning,"" Stafford says. ""We thought we were creating ideal communities for young families, but weren't thinking what it'd all look like 30 years down the road.""</p> \n<h3>Sprawl forces seniors to drive (even when it's not safe)</h3> \n<p>Anyone who lives long enough will likely lose the ability to safely operate a car. But <a href=""http://www.claimsjournal.com/news/national/2012/09/19/213818.htm"">most states don't require driving tests</a> for elderly drivers renewing their licenses.</p> \n<p>Many keep driving for longer than they should — and that can be seen in data on fatal crashes:</p> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""3776074""><img src=""https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3776074/Screen%20Shot%202015-06-09%20at%205.35.37%20PM.png""></div> \n<p>Drivers are way more likely to be involved in fatal crashes past the age of 75. And for those 85-plus, the data is even worse than it is for teens.</p> \n<p>This is mostly because in the event of a crash, older drivers are more likely to <a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/motorvehiclesafety/older_adult_drivers/"">die from injuries</a> than younger ones. But it's partly because older drivers have deteriorating vision and reaction time, which leads to more crashes overall.</p> \n<p>This doesn't mean we should blame senior citizens for wanting to drive — it's an overlooked cost of a system that gives them no choice.</p> \n<h3>Giving up driving can leave seniors isolated</h3> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3784576/shutterstock_247410904.0.jpg"" alt=""senior man"" data-chorus-asset-id=""3784576""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">(Shutterstock.com)</p> \n<p>Once seniors stop driving, those who remain in suburban homes are marooned in an environment designed to be traversed by car. The most obvious problem, says <a href=""http://geog.ufl.edu/people/faculty/golant/"">Stephen Golant</a>, a gerontologist at the University of Florida, is access to goods and services.</p> \n<p>But seniors who are isolated also have worse health outcomes and <a href=""http://www.nature.com/news/social-isolation-shortens-lifespan-1.12673"">lower life expectancies</a>, even after adjusting for preexisting health conditions and other factors. This may be because they're less likely to get health advice and monitoring from family and friends and also because they miss the emotional benefits of regular human contact.</p> \n<p>Isolation also means less tangible losses for both seniors and society at large. ""Pursuing the new relationships and learning opportunities that give meaning to life becomes more difficult if you're isolated,"" Stafford notes. And those who aren't seniors miss out on the chance to benefit from the millions of senior citizens who can no longer drive, but are capable of volunteering or contributing to society and our personal lives in other ways.</p> \n<p>Retirement homes partly solve this problem by providing contact with other residents and through shuttles for transportation to the outside world. But as part of the <a href=""http://www.ageinplace.org/"">aging in place movement</a>, fewer seniors are moving to them than before.</p> \n<p>In surveys, <a href=""http://assets.aarp.org/rgcenter/il/beyond_50_communities.pdf"">more than 90 percent</a> of senior citizens say they want to stay in their current homes as long as possible. Right now, if they want to avoid isolation, they're often forced to give that up.</p> \n<h3>Public paratransit shuttles are not enough</h3> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3784564/GettyImages-140796444.0.jpg"" alt=""paratransit"" data-chorus-asset-id=""3784564""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">A woman uses Boston's paratransit service. (Jonathan Wiggs/the Boston Globe via Getty Images)</p> \n<p>Some seniors have another choice: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paratransit"">paratransit</a>. Typically, these are systems that work in tandem with public transportation, providing shuttle service to people with disabilities to get them to a bus or subway stop. Public transport agencies are <a href=""http://civilrights.findlaw.com/discrimination/transportation-and-the-americans-with-disabilities-act-ada.html"">required by the 1990 Americans with Disabilities Act</a> to offer this service to anyone with a disability, and <a href=""http://www.apta.com/resources/reportsandpublications/Documents/TCRP_J11_Funding_Transit_Needs_of_Aging_Population.pdf"">about a third of its riders nationwide</a> are over 65.</p> \n<p>But for those who live in sprawling suburbs not designed to be serviced by public transit, trying to use paratransit can be difficult — if not impossible.</p> \n<p>Paratransit is only required to serve people living within 1.5 miles of a bus line, a range that excludes most suburban dwellers. Those eligible have to make appointments well ahead of time and block out an entire day for travel, since shuttles typically arrive within two-hour windows, like cable TV technicians.</p> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3784584/car.0.jpg"" alt=""paratransit st. louis"" data-chorus-asset-id=""3784584""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">St. Louis's paratransit eligibility zone for riders with disabilities (blue) leaves out large areas of the suburbs. (<a href=""http://www.metrostlouis.org/PlanYourTrip/MapsSchedules/CallARide.aspx"">Metro St. Louis</a>)</p> \n<p>The biggest problem is that lots of transit agencies have been getting stricter in deciding who's eligible for paratransit, sometimes limiting it to people who use wheelchairs. ""A lot of things that make you not a competent driver aren’t serious enough disabilities to qualify,"" <a href=""http://www.urban.org/author/sandra-rosenbloom"">Sandra Rosenbloom</a>, author of a recent <a href=""http://www.urban.org/research/publication/roadblocks-ahead-seniors-who-dont-drive"">Urban Institute report</a> on transportation for seniors, <a href=""http://newoldage.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/11/27/paratransit-stuck-in-the-slow-lane/"">told the New York Times</a>.</p> \n<p>These restrictions share the same root cause: <a href=""http://www.gao.gov/assets/660/650079.pdf"">the cost of paratransit is ballooning</a>:</p> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""3781822""><img src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3781822/Screen%20Shot%202015-06-11%20at%2012.11.09%20PM.png""></div> \n<p>That's partly because the systems are being asked to serve growing numbers of seniors spread out in the suburbs. Cash-strapped transit agencies underfund them, providing the bare minimum of service required by the law.</p> \n<p>On a fundamental level, given the suburbs many seniors live in, paratransit might just not work well as a transportation solution, says <a href=""http://geog.ufl.edu/people/faculty/golant/"">Stephen Golant</a>, a gerontologist at the University of Florida. ""It's not clear that it's the most effective way of getting older people to the goods and services they need.""</p> \n<p>There are plenty of private senior-oriented shuttle services that help fill the gap. But they can be pricey, and don't work for those on smaller fixed incomes.</p> \n<h3>New solutions to senior transportation</h3> \n<p>The good news is that some communities and organizations are experimenting with new approaches.</p> \n<p>Some are attempts to change development patterns in areas where seniors live. Stafford, for instance, is involved in planning a <a href=""http://www.livablecities.org/blog/lifetime-community-districts"">Lifetime Community District</a>: an area that incorporates a series of neighborhoods in Bloomington, Indiana, arranged along a three-mile multi-use path. It will include grocery stores, doctors' offices, parks, and community centers that seniors can reach by walking or using a wheelchair.</p> \n<p>There's also the increasingly popular <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elder_village"">Elder Village</a> model, implemented by dozens of organizations in different cities. It allows seniors to stay in their homes, with a mix of paid staff and volunteers giving rides, delivering groceries, and organizing social activities.</p> \n<p><q class=""right"" aria-hidden=""true"">""I think the Uber model is increasingly going to be important""</q></p> \n<p>Other experts are optimistic that new technologies can help fill in the gap. ""I think the Uber model is increasingly going to be important,"" says Golant. ""All kinds of products and services will increasingly be at the fingertips of all people, including seniors.""</p> \n<p>He suggests that cities might start subsidizing Uber or Lyft rides for people who qualify for paratransit, as a more efficient way of allocating transit money. As an alternative, Stafford envisions nonprofit ride-sharing apps specifically tailored to seniors — and perhaps delivery of groceries and other goods as well.</p> \n<p>More than anything else, <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/5/28/5756736/the-case-for-self-driving-cars"">self-driving cars</a> could revolutionize seniors' transportation options. Widespread self-driving technology is still years away, but Google has programmed cars that can safely navigate a heavily mapped area in Northern California.</p> \n<p>Some <a href=""http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/technology/2014/10/google_self_driving_car_it_may_never_actually_happen.html"">experts are skeptical</a> that they'll ever be functional in real-world driving conditions across the country. But if they do, they could provide an easy means of getting around for people who can no longer drive — allowing millions of seniors to remain in their homes without becoming isolated.</p>",Transportation

His 1892 invention was essentially a fixed metal track that riders could pedal specialized bikes along.</p> \n<p>He soon convinced inventor and manufacturer Hezekiah Smith to finance and built a prototype — a <a href=""http://www.citylab.com/commute/2012/08/dodging-cattle-and-bullets-new-jerseys-18th-century-bicycle-railroad/2833/"">two-mile rail</a> stretching from the latter's HB Smith Machine Company in Smithville, New Jersey to Mt. Holly, the home of many of the company's employees. Smith and Hotchkiss spent $10,000 on the track and charged workers two dollars for monthly passes, which allowed them to get to work in roughly six minutes.</p> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""3826932"">\n<img src=""https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3826932/HotchkissBikeRR.jpeg""> \n<div class=""caption""> \n<p>One of the bikes used on the Hotchkiss Railroad.</p> \n</div> \n</div> \n<p>The specialized bikes themselves were fascinating. Riders sat on a low seat just above the rail and pumped a lever, rather than pedaled, to push the bike along. The rail was a single track, so travelers coming from opposite directions had to avoid a collision by sorting out who'd get off.</p> \n<p>The track was an interesting novelty, but it never really took off. Most cyclists opted for the increasingly comfortable safety bicycles that were soon hitting the market, and though a few similar tracks were built in the UK, the idea died off within a few years.

DC and Boston ""feel"" like bigger cities than San Antonio (more pro sports teams, direct flights to more cities, bigger daily newspaper, worse traffic jams) because they are the centers of larger metro areas.

These startups want to do for buses what Uber did for taxi rides,http://www.vox.com/2015/7/7/8906027/microtransit-uber-buses,Would you book a bus ride with your smartphone?,"<p><em>This article is part of a </em><em><a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/4/29/8513699/future-of-commuting"">series about the past, present, and future of commuting in America</a></em><em>.</em></p> \n<p>Last Wednesday, I had my first experience with microtransit, when<strong> </strong>I hopped into a black Jeep Patriot that pulled up to a specified spot outside my Washington, DC, office after work. On the way home, I chatted with the driver — a friendly, bearded guy named Dean — until, a few minutes later, he got a notification on a small tablet mounted next to the dashboard.</p> \n<p><q aria-hidden=""true"" class=""right"">They offer transport options somewhere in between the pricey convenience of taxis and slow, cheap public transit</q></p> \n<p>The screen instructed Dean to alter his route by a few blocks to pick up another passenger, who got in the back seat. Then we continued onward. After I got out at my house, Dean drove the other guy home on a predetermined route, perhaps picking up more passengers along the way. Through my smartphone, I was charged $4.23 for the 2.5-mile, 12-minute trip — about half as much as an Uber would have cost.</p> \n<p>My ride was provided by the new startup <a href=""http://www.split.us/"">Split</a> — and some people think this sort of service could be the future of urban transportation. Split is just one of a number of companies springing up to offer transportation options that occupy a middle ground<strong> </strong>between the pricey convenience of taxis and the slow, cheap service of public transit. Although there isn't a widely accepted name for these services, some people are calling them <a href=""http://www.citylab.com/commute/2015/04/how-the-microtransit-movement-is-changing-urban-mobility/391565/"">""microtransit.""</a></p> \n<p>There are two broad categories of microtransit: One is services like <a href=""https://www.ridechariot.com/"">Chariot</a> and <a href=""http://www.bridj.com/"">Bridj</a>, which operate commuting shuttles in certain areas based on user demand. Then there are several services that let you split a ride with people nearby who need to get to a similar destination — including <a href=""http://www.cabcorner.com/"">CabCorner</a>, <a href=""http://ridewithvia.com/"">Via</a>, <a href=""http://blog.uber.com/uberpool"">UberPool</a>, and <a href=""https://www.lyft.com/line"">Lyft Line</a>. So far, these microtransit companies only operate in a handful of cities. But their backers hope they could one day do for public transit what Uber has done for cab rides.</p> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""3851978"" alt=""chariot routes"" src=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3851978/Screen_Shot_2015-07-07_at_10.18.38_AM.0.png""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Chariot's routes in San Francisco. (<a href=""https://www.ridechariot.com/"">Chariot</a>)</p> \n<h3>The origins of microtransit</h3> \n<p>The idea of microtransit isn't entirely new. In New York, unofficial shuttle buses called <a href=""http://projects.newyorker.com/story/nyc-dollar-vans/"">dollar vans</a> have quietly run for decades, carrying low-income riders from neighborhoods with relatively few public transportation options in Brooklyn, Queens, and New Jersey.</p> \n<p>But the latest wave of tech-based services largely started with a Helsinki program called <a href=""https://kutsuplus.fi/home"">Kutsuplus</a>, which launched in 2013. This is a network of municipally owned shuttle buses that run variable routes based on pickup requests by passengers.</p> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""3851986"" alt=""Kutsuplus"" src=""https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3851986/30-The-internet-of-traffic.0.jpg""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">(Kutsuplus)</p> \n<p>Passengers use their smartphones to request a pickup and specify their destinations. Kutsuplus then uses an algorithm to figure out the most efficient bus to send to them,  and specifies a fare for each passenger (which runs, on average, about a quarter of the price of a taxi). Once in motion, the bus might make occasional detours to pick up other passengers, but it stops much less often than a regular bus would.</p> \n<p>Kari Rissanen, director of the program, described it to me as ""a new form of public transport, positioned between taxis and traditional mass transport."" Most often, it's simply described as <a href=""http://www.bloomberg.com/bw/articles/2014-05-16/helsinkis-uber-for-buses-is-stuck-in-first-gear"">Uber for buses</a>. So far, Kutsuplus is just a pilot program, running a mere 15 buses, and it's heavily subsidized by the Helsinki government. But the system has inspired several startups in San Francisco, Boston, and DC — including Split, which bought the company that created Kutsuplus' algorithm.</p> \n<h3>The potential benefits of ""Uber for buses""</h3> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3851976/Screen_Shot_2015-07-07_at_10.17.40_AM.0.png"" alt=""chariot"" data-chorus-asset-id=""3851976""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">(<a href=""https://www.ridechariot.com/"">Chariot</a>)</p> \n<p>The one thing that unites all these new services is that their routes are based on demand, whether in real time (like the Split ride I requested) or in the aggregate (like Chariot, which creates a new shuttle route when enough users have <a href=""https://www.ridechariot.com/roll-my-route"">specified it as their commute</a> over time).</p> \n<p>This could give them a key advantage over traditional transit. ""Municipal transit agencies collect a lot of data, but they don't actually do anything with it,"" says David Block-Schachter, chief scientist of Bridj, which adds service areas for its shared shuttles based on where users have requested expansion.</p> \n<p>He points out that his previous employer, Boston's transit authority, still runs subway lines along routes set <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_MBTA"">150 years ago</a>, when trains were pulled by teams of horses. Bridj, by contrast, plans to fully harness the flexibility of buses in a way that transit agencies never really have. In theory, this could allow for a service that's only slightly more expensive than public transit, but much more convenient.</p> \n<p>Bridj and Chariot are starting out by serving high-demand commuting routes — going from largely wealthy residential neighborhoods to commercial downtown areas.<strong> </strong>They<strong> </strong>hope that over time, they can lure riders away from public transit or driving by providing a slightly quicker, more comfortable service.</p> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""3851988"" alt=""bridj boston"" src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3851988/download.0.png""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Bridj's service areas in Boston. (<a href=""http://www.bridj.com/greater-boston-service-area"">Birdj</a>)</p> \n<p>It's still very, very early on. Most of these startups are only in one or two cities, and they run very limited routes. But <a href=""http://www.arch.columbia.edu/about/people/dk2475columbiaedu"">David King</a>, a Columbia transportation researcher, notes that if they succeed, they could help bring back carpooling, which has been falling for decades. ""The transaction cost of matching driver and rider has just been too high [for carpooling to work well],"" King says. ""But by reducing it through technology, these companies could really open up the market for shared rides.""</p> \n<h3>It's still unclear whether microtransit will ever catch on</h3> \n<p>But it's hard to say whether microtransit services will achieve mass appeal — or whether they'll end up being a cool idea that never quite panned out.</p> \n<div class=""align-right""> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3852536/IMG_0057.0.jpeg"" alt=""Split"" data-chorus-asset-id=""3852536""></p> \n<p class=""caption""><span>A Split car in Washington, DC. (Split)</span></p> \n</div> \n<p>One open question is whether they'll acquire enough regular riders to be able to charge relatively low prices while still turning a profit. ""The key for us isn't getting two or three people on a vehicle — it's getting eight or 10 on a vehicle, which is what allows us to keep prices low,"" Bridj's Block-Schachter says.</p> \n<p>But to get this many on a vehicle, Bridj and other companies need passengers to be relatively near to one another to begin with, so the buses and cars don't need to be rerouted too far to pick up each new passenger. This means establishing a dense customer base. To do that, they'll need to offer service to much broader areas than they do now. As Block-Schachter says, ""The more area you're able to cover, the more origins and destinations you can serve, the more attractive the service becomes.""</p> \n<p>That's still a long way off. In San Francisco, Chariot just runs <a href=""https://www.ridechariot.com/routes"">limited routes</a> between a few neighborhoods. In Washington, DC, Bridj <a href=""http://www.bridj.com/dc-metro-service-area"">only runs</a> between two limited areas:</p> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""3850242""><img src=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3850242/download.png""></div> \n<p>Meanwhile, Split serves a somewhat broader area of DC, but my driver told me that at the moment, the vast majority of rides are solo: The company doesn't really have enough customers for them to actually split rides all that often.</p> \n<h3>Another challenge: Will microtransit be legal in most cities?</h3> \n<p>These microtransit companies might also have to fight endless regulatory battles, just as <a href=""http://www.theverge.com/2014/12/15/7393693/uber-fights-to-expand-across-the-globe-storystream"">Uber has over the past few years</a>. It's an open question whether various municipal regulations will permit private companies to run this sort of semi-public transport.</p> \n<p>Some, like Bridj, are explicitly trying to <a href=""http://www.baconsrebellion.com/2015/04/step-aside-uber-bridj-is-the-next-wave-of-transportation-disruption.html"" target=""_blank"">work with transit agencies</a> and have <a href=""http://www.xconomy.com/boston/2015/02/25/bridjs-data-driven-private-bus-fleet-heading-to-dc/"" target=""_blank"">gained regulatory approval</a> from cities before going in.</p> \n<p>Others have put less stock in this sort of compliance. <a href=""http://www.rideleap.com/"">Leap</a><span> — a startup that ran luxury, express buses in San Francisco — is a cautionary tale. It </span><a href=""http://www.theverge.com/2015/5/20/8631213/leap-private-bus-san-francisco-temporary-shutdown"">received a cease-and-desist order</a><span> from the California Public Utilities Commission in May, and though the </span><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/rideleap"">company said</a><span> it was in compliance with the law and vowed to return to service, it </span><a href=""http://fusion.net/story/150110/for-sale-startup-bus-barely-worn/"">began selling its buses in June</a><span>.</span></p> \n<h3>Are microtransit startups actually a good thing for cities?</h3> \n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=""3851996"" alt=""bridj dc"" src=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3851996/GettyImages-477958094.0.jpg""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Riders in a DC Bridj shuttle. (Astrid Riecken/the Washington Post via Getty Images)</p> \n<p>Even if they are deemed legal, there's also the broader question of whether these sorts of startups are good for cities in the first place. CityLab's Eric Jaffe has written <a href=""http://www.citylab.com/commute/2015/04/how-the-microtransit-movement-is-changing-urban-mobility/391565/"">an excellent analysis of the pros and cons here</a>.</p> \n<p>On the one hand, microtransit companies have the potential to reduce car use by allowing people to share vehicles more efficiently, cutting down on congestion and greenhouse gas emissions. They could also potentially help increase ridership for mass transit, says UC Berkeley transportation researcher <a href=""http://tsrc.berkeley.edu/SusanShaheen"">Susan Shaheen</a>, by solving the so-called <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_mile_(transportation)"">""last mile""</a> problem. For people in geographically isolated neighborhoods, microtransit could provide a much-needed link to subway or bus stops.</p> \n<p>So far, however, the startups are mainly serving as direct competition to transit, rather than a complement. ""They're poaching high-income passengers — the people who are willing to pay a few extra bucks to save some time,"" King says. ""This could diminish political support for public transit. And if they pull people off regular transit, the transit agency could reduce service.""</p> \n<p>The fear is that by creating a segregated, two-tiered transport system, we'd be allowing for fast, comfortable service for those who can afford it — and slower, less frequent service for those who can't.</p> \n<p>To be sure, microtransit services aren't wildly expensive — they're often just a few dollars more than the city bus for a comparable ride. On the other hand, they do require credit cards and smartphones to book rides, and they disproportionately serve high-income neighborhoods at the moment. (Shaheen cautions, however, that we don't yet have socioeconomic data on riders.)</p> \n<p>King suggests that cities would be smart to try coordinating with these startups now, instead of trying to ban them or allowing them to grow on their own. Transit agencies could encourage them to operate the last-mile services that might not make sense for larger buses, providing feeder systems for high-capacity rail lines. They could also create a unified payment system for both transit and microtransit — perhaps even subsidizing lower-income passengers' rides on the latter.</p> \n<p>""There are ways to accomplish these goals,"" he says, ""but I haven't seen any public discussion about actually doing it yet.""</p> \n<h3>WATCH: The economics of being a driver for hire</h3> \n<!--  ########  BEGIN VOLUME VIDEO  ########  --> \n<div class=""volume-video"" id=""volume-placement-384"" data-volume-placement=""article"" data-analytics-placement=""entry:middle"" data-volume-id=""255"" data-volume-uuid=""07d83338f"" data-analytics-label=""The math of being a Lyft driver | 255"" data-analytics-action=""volume:view:entry:middle"" data-analytics-viewport=""video""></div> \n<!--  ########  END VOLUME VIDEO  ########  -->  \n<hr> \n<p><b>Correction</b>: This article previously stated that Split had licensed Kutsuplus' algorithm, instead of buying the company that had created it, along with the algorithm itself.</p>",Transportation

Putting roads on ""diets"" — slowing down traffic by turning a second traffic lane into a turning, bike, or parking lane — can cut down on crashes by anywhere from <a href=""http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/publications/research/safety/10053/index.cfm"">18 to 25 percent</a>.

No other cars, and no street parking.</p> \n<p>These unusual restrictions might seem pretty out there, but in a sense, they're a throwback. We take it for granted that streets are for cars, but even in the US, streets — which take up <a href=""http://oldurbanist.blogspot.com/2011/12/we-are-25-looking-at-street-area.html"">20 to 40 percent</a> of the total land area in most cities — were once <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/1/15/7551873/jaywalking-history"">universally used as a mixed public space</a> for pedestrians, pushcart vendors, horse-drawn vehicles, streetcars, and children.</p> \n<p>As Johannesburg gets set to ban cars in its central business district as part of the <a href=""http://www.ecomobilityfestival.org/"">second EcoMobility festival</a> this October, it's worth looking at Haenggung-dong's surprising success when it ran this experiment.</p> \n<p><span>""People began to see the streets as extensions of their homes — they used them to sit together and talk,"" said Konrad Otto-Zimmermann </span><span>of </span><a href=""http://www.iclei.org/"">Local Governments for Sustainability</a>, who helped organize the event<span>. ""It's amazing how the availability of quiet, calm, and safe streets changed the whole neighborhood's atmosphere.""</span></p> \n<h3>Why this neighborhood banned cars</h3> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""3923518"">\n<img src=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3923518/Book%20page%2056.jpg""> \n<div class=""caption""> \n<p>Haenggung-dong, shown during the festival.</p> \n</div> \n</div> \n<p>In 2011, Yeom Tae-Young, mayor of Suwon, met with Otto-Zimmermann, who'd been proposing his car-free neighborhood idea to mayors around the world. Yeom wanted to participate, and three neighborhoods eventually volunteered to be part of the festival, which was coordinated by the city, as well as Otto-Zimmermann and his colleague Yeonhee Park.</p> \n<p>Haenggung-dong, which has about 4,300 residents, was selected for a few different reasons. It's a historical district, with fairly narrow, walkable streets, and 54 percent of its inhabitants don't own cars. But it's also seen some decline since the 1970s — as the city's newer outlying areas drew population from the center — and officials thought the festival and accompanying infrastructure upgrades could help revitalize it.</p> \n<p>Still, banning cars for a month was a bold move. The majority of residents supported it (by the time of the festival, a third had actually joined the neighborhood association that helped organize it), but there was also some opposition. Most, Otto-Zimmermann says, came from small-business owners in the area who were worried about their ability to get deliveries.</p> \n<p>Ultimately, they negotiated with the city for a key concession: Jeongjo-ro, the main, four-lane road that traversed Haenggung-dong, would only be closed to motor traffic for eight of the 30 days of the festival. Combined with the occasional shuttle deliveries they were permitted on the smaller streets, most were satisfied, and the shop owners association announced its support.</p> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""3923512"">\n<img src=""https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3923512/Festival%20Area%20Map%20Korean.jpg""> \n<div class=""caption""> \n<p>A map of Haenggung-dong.

The total cost of all these improvements — about $10.45 million — was mostly paid by the city.</p> \n<h3>How residents survived an entire month without cars</h3> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""3923580"">\n<img src=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3924420/neighborhood_1__c__ICLEI_e.V__2013.0.JPG"" alt=""neighborhood_1__c__ICLEI_e.V__2013.0.JPG"" data-chorus-asset-id=""3924420""> \n<div class=""caption""> \n<p>Haenggung-dong, shown during the festival.</p> \n</div> \n</div> \n<p>As the festival approached, the neighborhood held occasional car-free trial periods on certain streets during some weekend days. By the time it started, residents were required to remove all 1,500 or so street-parked cars to lots elsewhere that the city had reserved.</p> \n<p>Once it began, neighborhood association members and other volunteers stood at checkpoints to block cars from coming in and explain what was going on. The city also ran shuttle buses to bring residents from the edge of the neighborhood to the parking areas, as well as a 24-hour support service for people with medical needs. Along with new bike rental stations and pedicabs, 400 bikes and scooters were given to residents to use for free.</p> \n<p>The car ban did have some downsides. Business owners had to wait longer for deliveries, and residents who'd otherwise drive to leave the neighborhood had to take an extra shuttle. Adjacent areas experienced heavier traffic, especially for the eight days the main road was closed — something <a href=""https://www.htxt.co.za/2015/07/30/expect-traffic-chaos-during-joburgs-ecomobility-festival/"">people are especially worried about</a> for Johannesburg's upcoming festival.</p> \n<p>But there were also lots of unexpected benefits. Adults reported socializing more with neighbors, and spending more time outside. Children had much more space to play safely.</p> \n<p>Even for many shop owners, the ban — and the surge of foot traffic attracted by the festival — was a net positive. ""Some even wanted to keep the ban in place permanently, because it brought more customers and gave them more space for outside seating,"" Otto-Zimmermann said.</p> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""3923654"">\n<img src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3923654/DSC_8132.jpg""> \n<div class=""caption""> \n<p>A community performance during the festival.</p> \n</div> \n</div> \n<p>Opening up the streets also led to all sorts of surprising uses. Neighborhood groups put on plays and other performances. Children played in them throughout the day, while adults set up badminton courts at night.</p> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""3923658""><img src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3923658/IMGM2267.JPG""></div> \n<p>Lots of elderly people live in Haenggung-dong, and it might seem like banning cars would cut them off from the outside world. But for wheelchair users, at least, it made life much easier.</p> \n<p>Previously, Yeonhee Park writes in <em><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Neighborhood-Motion-One-Month-Cars/dp/3868592946"">Neighborhood in Motion</a></em><em> </em>— a book on the festival — they had ""to drive between the cars in the streets since there are no sidewalks, or they were too narrow because of poles, hydrants, and stalls, or blocked cars."" Banning cars let them get around safely.</p> \n<h3>We won't ban cars — but there are still lessons to be learned</h3> \n<p>In the vast majority of the US, banning cars for an entire month would be utterly impractical. What's more, this was a short-term trial, and its success depended heavily on a big investment in infrastructure, as well as a brief spike in visitors that wouldn't continue over the long haul.</p> \n<p>But US cities have gradually been using street space more creatively in subtler ways — and in doing so, they've similarly challenged the idea that streets are for cars alone.</p> \n<p>New York, for instance, <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/20/nyregion/20closings.html?_r=0"">permanently closed off parts of Broadway</a> to car traffic in 2010. Many other cities have built <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/6/5/5782472/study-bike-lanes-really-do-increase-biking"">protected bike lanes</a> and promoted <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_calming"">traffic calming</a> measures — such as narrower lanes, wider sidewalks, and curb extensions at pedestrian crossings. These sorts of changes have been shown to <a href=""http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/publications/research/safety/10053/index.cfm"">cut down on crashes</a> and <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/5/29/8682707/walking-biking-cities-transportation"">increase the number of people who walk and bike</a>.</p> \n<p>Like Haenggung-dong's experiment, these changes have often been preceded by opposition from local businesses. But once in effect, they've been far less disastrous than feared — and have sometimes led to surprising benefits. In New York, for instance, businesses located along newly built bike lanes <a href=""http://www.fastcoexist.com/1682022/want-to-make-money-build-a-business-on-a-bike-lane"">have seen greater increases in sales</a> than similar businesses on nearby streets.</p> \n<p>And even though banning cars forever isn't a sensible move for any city, there's a related policy that could be: congestion pricing. This sort of scheme, in place in London, Singapore, and other cities in Europe and Asia, requires drivers to pay a fee in order to enter a downtown, cutting down on traffic and making streets safer and more accessible for pedestrians.</p> \n<p>In the US, the New York City government <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/01/nyregion/01congestion.html?ref=nyregion&amp;gwh=CFED18D724F0923D748B5C29F449D56B&amp;gwt=pay"">approved such a plan</a> in 2008, but the <a href=""http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/04/07/congestion-pricing-plan-is-dead-assembly-speaker-says/?gwh=80DEE8F063AB98D4DF81E943AB1A858F&amp;gwt=pay"">state government rejected it</a>, and the plan appeared to be dead. More recently, though, updated congestion pricing plans <a href=""https://nextcity.org/daily/entry/congestion-pricing-in-new-york-may-come-back-from-the-dead"">have gotten a bit more support</a>. New York shouldn't and won't ban cars entirely, but charging them to enter pedestrian-oriented areas like Manhattan would be a huge step in the right direction.</p>",Transportation
This California city just built the country's first protected intersection for bikes,http://www.vox.com/2015/8/12/9139771/protected-intersection-bike-davis,It could make biking way safer.,"<p><iframe src=""https://player.vimeo.com/video/86721046?byline=0&amp;portrait=0"" width=""750"" height=""422"" frameborder=""0""></iframe></p> \n<p>For years, Dutch cities have been building <a href=""http://www.peopleforbikes.org/blog/entry/four-u.s.-cities-are-racing-to-open-the-countrys-first-protected-intersecti"">protected intersections</a>: crossings that are designed to reduce the risk of cyclists getting hit by turning cars.

Here's how to change that.</a>\n</div> \n<p>The rationale for these new intersections is straightforward. <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/6/5/5782472/study-bike-lanes-really-do-increase-biking"">Protected bike lanes</a> — which are physically separated from the street by a curb or other barrier and have spread widely in the US over the past decade — have <a href=""http://www.peopleforbikes.org/statistics/category/protected-bike-lane-statistics"">significantly cut down on</a> cyclist injuries and deaths. But even on streets that have them, cyclists still have to ride through intersections right next to car traffic — and <a href=""https://www.cityofchicago.org/content/dam/city/depts/cdot/bike/general/BikeCrashReport2012.pdf"">evidence</a> suggests that the majority of crashes occur at intersections, when turning cars are most likely to hit them.</p> \n<p>Protected intersections solve this problem with separated channels for cyclists to ride through. They also orient drivers so that they can more easily see pedestrians and bikes when they're turning. As <a href=""http://www.peopleforbikes.org/blog/entry/four-u.s.-cities-are-racing-to-open-the-countrys-first-protected-intersecti"">Michael Andersen at People for Bikes</a> puts it, ""Instead of forcing people in cars and on bikes alike to look constantly over their shoulders for one another, protected intersections arrange traffic so that everyone can see what's going on simply by looking forward.""</p> \n<h3>How the new protected intersection works</h3> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""3960136""><img src=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3960136/dutch-junctionW.jpg""></div> \n<p>Davis's new intersection is intended to solve one big problem in particular: when a cyclist, going straight, is next to a car that's turning right.</p> \n<p>With most protected bike lanes, the barrier disappears at the intersection. Right-turning cars either mingle with bike traffic or are forced to merge through it — both of which require drivers to spot bikes in their mirrors and avoid them. Often they don't see cyclists, leading to a type of accident called the <a href=""http://davesbikeblog.blogspot.com/2007/06/watch-out-for-right-hook.html"">right hook</a>.</p> \n<p>Davis's new intersection — like the ones in the Netherlands — includes special islands at the corners. Cyclists going straight can ride to the right of them, and the islands' shape ensures that right-turning cars will encounter these cyclists straight on. Instead of looking over their shoulders to see bikes, drivers see them directly in front of their windshields.</p> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3962634/c6b68645bd05b961fa_h2m6bx4ha.0.JPG"" alt=""A photo of Davis"" data-chorus-asset-id=""3962634""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">(City of Davis)</p> \n<p><span>The islands also make pedestrians more visible to drivers in the same way and give them a shorter distance to walk when crossing the street. And the islands force cars to take turns more slowly, further reducing the chance of a crash.</span></p> \n<p>Finally, the intersection gives cyclists a new safer, slower option for making one of the more dangerous moves: a left turn. While they can still merge over to the turning lane and turn left through the intersection like a car (the top blue line in the diagram above), they can alternatively act a bit more like a pedestrian, proceeding across the intersection, then crossing it again at a perpendicular angle after the light has turned (the bottom blue line).</p> \n<p>Many cyclists do this already — it's called a <a href=""http://cycleguide.dk/2010/05/how-to-do-a-hook-turn/"">hook turn</a> — but the new design makes both legs of this maneuver safer.</p> \n<h3>Why infrastructure design is so important</h3> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/assets/4570149/5862685992_f2d747580d_o.jpg"" alt=""bike lane"" data-chorus-asset-id=""643292""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">Vancouver's protected bike lane.

All this is part of a boom in bike-specific infrastructure across the US, as many cities <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/5/29/8682707/walking-biking-cities-transportation"">try to get more people to bike and walk</a> to cut down on traffic.</p> \n<p>It's happening for a good reason. <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/6/5/5782472/study-bike-lanes-really-do-increase-biking"">Plenty of research shows</a> that the presence of protected bike lanes, for instance, is one of the strongest factors that make people willing to try biking in a city. The world's cities with the highest rates of bicycling — such as Copenhagen and Amsterdam — <a href=""http://vtpi.org/puchertq2.pdff"">have the highest amounts</a> of protected bike lanes and trails, and <a href=""http://nexus.umn.edu/Courses/pa8202/Dill.pdf"">research shows</a> this correlation also holds for US cities. Davis, which has held the US title for the <a href=""http://bikeleague.org/sites/default/files/ACS_report_2014_forweb_edit.pdf#12"">highest percentage of bike commuters</a> for decades and has an extensive bike lane network, is the perfect example of this.</p> \n<p>The basic reason is that absent this infrastructure, roads across the US are often designed solely with cars in mind. There might be a core group of hardcore bikers who are willing to ride right next to car traffic, but it's pretty small — and reaching new people requires intentionally designing roads to make biking safe.</p> \n<p>Martha Roskowski of the advocacy group <a href=""http://www.peopleforbikes.org/"">People for Bikes</a> has a great analogy for this idea. Riding a bike in the streets, like a car, is <a href=""http://www.peopleforbikes.org/blog/entry/its-time-to-stop-building-black-diamond-bike-lanes"">akin to skiing a black diamond run</a> down a mountain. A minority of bikers might do it (and even enjoy it), but to make most people comfortable with the idea of biking in a city, we need the equivalent of green circle and blue square ski routes — protected lanes and intersections. More importantly, these need to make up a linked, cohesive system, so people can bike from home to work, for instance, without needing to brave a black diamond along the way.</p>",Transportation

But data tells us this isn't always true: In New York City, for instance, <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/9/8/6121129/bike-lanes-traffic-new-york"">bike lanes have actually shortened cars' travel times</a> on several streets, while simultaneously encouraging people to bike and making it safer.</p> \n<p>How can this be?

Here's how to change that.</a>\n</div> \n<p><a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/5/29/8682707/walking-biking-cities-transportation"">The video above — created by city planner </a><a href=""http://www.jeffspeck.com/"">Jeff Speck</a> and artist <a href=""http://www.cupolamedia.com/"">Spencer Boomhower</a> — nicely explains four types of road diets, a trend that has become increasingly popular in US cities over the past few decades.</p> \n<p>These diets can take several forms, but the basic idea is that by removing traffic lanes, cities can free up space for bike lanes and <a href=""http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/publications/research/safety/10053/index.cfm"">reduce the frequency of crashes</a>. Narrowing lanes <a href=""http://www.citylab.com/design/2014/10/why-12-foot-traffic-lanes-are-disastrous-for-safety-and-must-be-replaced-now/381117/"">from 12 feet to 10</a>, meanwhile, makes drivers less likely to speed, and in doing so has also been shown to <a href=""http://usa.streetsblog.org/2015/05/27/compelling-evidence-that-wider-lanes-make-city-streets-more-dangerous/"">cut down on crashes</a> that involve drivers, cyclists, and pedestrians.</p> \n<p>All this sounds like it would cause tons of congestion and make it harder to drive. But in many cases, it can be done without actually increasing the time it takes a driver to travel a given distance — and can sometimes even decrease it.</p> \n<p>One reason is that short bursts of speeding, interspersed with waits at traffic lights, don't actually shorten travel times all that much — they just make streets more dangerous. Another is that if a street carries fewer than <a href=""http://safety.fhwa.dot.gov/road_diets/info_guide/rdig.pdf"">20,000 cars per day</a>, it generally doesn't need a second lane to maintain a smooth flow of traffic. Many of the roads targeted for diets carry far fewer cars to begin with.</p> \n<p>What's more, though they allot less space to cars, many road diets use that space much more efficiently. For instance, road diet No. 2 in the video above (the most common type) removes a driving lane in both directions, but introduces a dedicated left turn lane for cars going in either direction.</p> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""3988988""><img src=""https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3988988/2015-08-21%2014_42_04.gif""></div> \n<p>This allows cars to wait to turn left without holding up traffic behind them — and is one reason why road diets and bike lanes along Broadway and Eighth and Ninth Avenues in New York City <a href=""http://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/downloads/pdf/2014-09-03-bicycle-path-data-analysis.pdf"">shortened travel times</a> while significantly reducing cyclist injuries.</p>",Transportation

During the experiment, they'll use sensors and cameras to gather data on the Cessna's precise impact and will look for signals transmitted by the plane's onboard emergency locators.</p> \n<p>All this data could help NASA design more durable transmitters — which someday could make it easier for rescue teams to find downed planes.</p>",Transportation
Why Google's self-driving cars will be great for cyclists and pedestrians,http://www.vox.com/2015/8/31/9222959/google-car-self-driving,Humans get bored and distracted.

But the truth is that humans are pretty bad drivers in all sorts of ways.</p> \n<p>As <a href=""https://medium.com/backchannel/the-view-from-the-front-seat-of-the-google-self-driving-car-46fc9f3e6088"">another Google post detailed</a>, its cars frequently spot people driving on the wrong side of the road, dangerously turning across several lanes of traffic, and proceeding through intersections when there are still cars or cyclists in them. Human drivers zone out, miss cars in their blind spots, and often fail to spot bikes and pedestrians. This is part of why more than 30,000 people die in traffic crashes in the US each year.</p> \n<p>Put simply, if a tech company introduced the human as a product engineered to drive cars, it'd go out of business.</p> \n<h3>Google's cars don't get bored or distracted</h3> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""4009432""><img src=""https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4009432/GettyImages-152766337.jpg""></div> \n<p>Google's cars aren't perfect yet. The real world is a very complicated driving environment, and the track stand story shows they still have a long way to go.</p> \n<p>But when it comes to safety, they have the potential to outstrip human drivers in every way imaginable. Their algorithms don't get bored, tired, or angry, and their 360-degree laser sensors mean they don't have blind spots. Just as importantly, they're seemingly programmed to always err on the side of excessive caution.</p> \n<p>As a Mountain View, California, resident — who frequently interacts with these cars on the roads near Google's headquarters — <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/6/1/8700459/google-self-driving-cars"">wrote in June</a>, ""Google cars drive like your grandma — they're never the first off the line at a stop light, they don't accelerate quickly, they don't speed, and they never take any chances with lane changes (cut people off, etc.)."" The resident described how the cars wait a few seconds after a  pedestrian has completely cleared a crosswalk before beginning to turn through it.</p> \n<p>And Google is clearly taking cyclists and pedestrians into account in the design of their cars' algorithms. It's <a href=""http://googleblog.blogspot.co.at/2014/04/the-latest-chapter-for-self-driving-car.html"">specifically upgraded its software</a> to navigate chaotic city streets, and earlier this year it <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/innovations/wp/2015/05/04/google-patents-a-way-for-self-driving-cars-to-understand-a-cyclists-hand-signals/"">patented a way</a> for its cars to interpret bikers' hand signals.</p> \n<p>Anyone who's spent much time walking or biking in the US is familiar with the danger human drivers pose when you don't have the protection of a big metal shell around you. As someone who travels mainly by bike — and has experienced countless uncomfortably close passes and near-misses when drivers fail to see me — the idea of riding next to self-driving cars is way more appealing.</p>",Transportation
"Study: Bike share has (slightly) reduced congestion in Washington, DC",http://www.vox.com/2015/9/6/9263307/bike-share-traffic,Neighborhoods with stations saw a 2 to 3 percent reduction in traffic.,"<p>Bike-share systems are <a href=""http://www.citylab.com/city-makers-connections/bike-share/"">booming</a> in cities across the country. One of their main benefits, according to boosters, is that by encouraging people to bike for transportation, they cut down on traffic.</p> \n<p>But does that actually happen? Until recently, we had virtually no data on the impact of bike-share systems on traffic.</p> \n<p><!--  ########  BEGIN SNIPPET  ########  --></p> \n<div class=""chorus-snippet s-related"" data-analytics-action=""link:related"" data-analytics-category=""article"">\n<span class=""s-related__title"">Related</span> <!-- Add links here --><a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/5/15/8608567/bike-share-wealth-race"">Bike share users are mostly rich and white. Here's why that's hard to change.</a>\n</div> \n<p>So in a <a href=""http://www.rff.org/files/document/file/RFF-DP-15-39.pdf"">new study</a>, Timothy Hamilton and Casey Wichman of <a href=""http://www.rff.org/home"">Resources for the Future</a> examine the effect of Washington, DC's Capital Bikeshare network — and they say that on the whole, bike-share stations appear to reduce congestion in surrounding areas by 2 to 3 percent. Interestingly, though, the stations appear to slightly increase<em> </em>car traffic in <em>adjacent</em> neighborhoods, possibly by causing drivers to avoid bike-heavy areas.</p> \n<h3>How the study worked</h3> \n<p>Hamilton and Wichman looked at the impact of a bike-share station on congestion in each of the DC metro area's <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Census_block_group"">census block groups</a>. These are areas designated by the US Census that typically have 600 to 3,000 people living in them. The idea was to use these, rather than smaller areas called <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Census_block"">census blocks</a>, because block groups are large enough that you probably wouldn't end up walking to another one to get a bike.</p> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""4031656"">\n<img src=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4031656/Screen%20Shot%202015-09-04%20at%204.45.52%20PM.png""> \n<div class=""caption""> \n<p>The Washington, DC, area's census block groups.</p> \n</div> \n</div> \n<p>The researchers used traffic data from the University of Maryland's <a href=""http://www.cattlab.umd.edu/"">CATT Lab</a>, which details the speed and volume of cars on a huge number of the DC area's roads. They specifically defined congestion as how slow cars actually traveled, compared with how fast they'd go on each road if they were allowed to flow freely, only restrained by speed limits.</p> \n<p>Of course, bike-share stations aren't placed randomly: They're most often put in relatively dense, pedestrian-friendly neighborhoods, as well as ones that are <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/5/15/8608567/bike-share-wealth-race"">disproportionately wealthy</a>. So to combat this bias, the researchers sought to compare pairs of areas that were otherwise similar, but only one had gotten a bike share station. To do that, they matched the 82 areas that got stations sometime during 2010 with 82 control areas that didn't, but were comparable in terms of pre-2010 congestion levels, wealth, land value, and proximity to a metro station.</p> \n<p>Now, there are a few caveats here. If you're using bike share instead of a car, you're going to reduce traffic on all the roads that make up your entire route — and not just the area in the vicinity of your station. (It's likely that most people bike across multiple blocks.) That said, if bike sharing really were reducing congestion, you'd still expect to see a disproportionate reduction in the block groups that contain bike-share stations — and thus serve as the start and end of trips — rather than those that don't.</p> \n<p>The other big caveat is that this is just one study, in one city, over one period of time. DC's traffic trends might not be applicable to other cities'. What's more, the study's data only runs through 2012. Things might have changed since.</p> \n<h3>How bike share affected DC's traffic patterns</h3> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""4031652""><img src=""https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4031652/GettyImages-482985788.jpg""></div> \n<p>Hamilton and Wichman looked at the level of congestion in each area's roads during weekday morning rush hours in April, May, September, and October for each of the years from 2010 to 2012. And on the whole, they found that areas with bike share saw congestion decline by 2 to 3 percent during that period, compared with similar areas that didn't get stations.</p> \n<p>This definitely isn't an earth-shattering change — depending on the free flow speed of the road, it works out to about a 2 to 3 percent increase in average speed — but when you multiply that across millions of drivers, that could mean a lot of time saved. ""I was surprised at how big the effect was,"" <a href=""https://wamu.org/news/15/08/28/bikeshare_program_indeed_reduces_traffic_in_some_neighborhoods_study_finds"">Wichman told WAMU</a>.</p> \n<p>When he and Hamilton looked at individual roads, they found an especially big decline on those designed for faster traffic to begin with. Roads with 35 miles per hour or greater speed limits in areas with bike share stations saw the biggest congestion reductions, approaching 3 percent or more. On the surface, this makes sense — these commuting corridors are disproportionately slowed down by excess traffic, and people on bikes probably try to avoid riding on them, sticking to slower side streets.</p> \n<p>Finally, the researchers found a smaller but measurable increase in congestion in areas that were adjacent to those with bike-share stations, whether or not they had stations themselves.</p> \n<p>One possible explanation is that it's a spillover effect: Drivers, in theory, might learn that certain areas have lots of bikers and try to avoid them accordingly. But this finding didn't come from the same sort of comparison with control areas. So it's possible it's just a result of the fact that most of the areas adjacent to those with stations are in denser parts of the city, and became more congested between 2010 and 2012 for other reasons.</p>",Transportation
Jon Chait wrote an optimistic take on climate change. Is it justified?,http://www.vox.com/2015/9/13/9313727/chait-climate-optimism,A scientific assessment.,"<p>Jonathan Chait has a big cover story on climate change in New York magazine: <a href=""http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2015/09/sunniest-climate-change-story-ever-read.html"">""This Is the Year Humans Finally Got Serious About Saving Themselves From Themselves.""</a> As the title indicates, it is an optimistic take on the state of the climate fight.</p> \n<p>Several people have asked what I think of it. Mostly I think it's great! If even half of mainstream political pundits understood climate as well as Chait, the world would be a better place (literally).</p> \n<p>Predictably, my favorite part is Chait's straight talk about the Republican Party:</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>The entire world is, in essence, tiptoeing gingerly around the unhinged second-largest political party in the world’s second-largest greenhouse-gas emitter, in hopes of saving the world behind its back.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Well put! And he calls climate denialism ""a regional quirk in the most powerful country on Earth,"" which captures both the absurdity and danger of it.</p> \n<p>My least favorite part of the piece was the big, gaping hole in the middle of it, which we'll get to in a little bit.</p> \n<p>Mostly, though, people have asked whether Chait's optimism is justified. Unfortunately, there's no simple answer to that question. Climate change presents an interpretive dilemma that translates into endless, unresolvable fights between different interpretive communities.</p> \n<p>Everything in the realm of political possibility today is woefully inadequate to the challenge of climate change. From that perspective, it's all a bunch of craven, corporatist, sheeple-distracting nonsense, unworthy of praise and a far cry from grounds for optimism. They refuse to grade on a curve.</p> \n<p>But if you cast that big net over the entire political process, you miss a lot of important nuances and distinctions. You might be right on climate change, but you will not be a particularly effective or insightful participant in the political process, where everything is measured against the status quo, not the ideal.</p> \n<p>Others prefer to assess sociopolitical progress in the context of a particular historical trajectory, a particular set of institutions, and a particular political economy. From that perspective, any progress that breaks free of the extraordinary weight of status quo bias is a win —it is, explicitly, grading on a curve.</p> \n<p>Which interpretive community you choose largely reduces to temperament and tribal affiliation. Both are correct in their own way. Chait's piece measures progress against the baseline status quo, and I will mostly assess his premises from that perspective.</p> \n<p>So let's be scientific about this and break it down into multiple optimisms, with separate plausibility ratings, from 1 (never going to happen) to 10 (a sure thing). Also, it's the weekend, so let's keep it short.</p> \n<p>It turns out, Chait's optimisms decline in plausibility as the piece goes along.</p> \n<h3>Technological innovation: 8</h3> \n<p>A primary source of optimism for Chait is the rapidly advancing state of clean energy technology. And there is certainly reason for optimism in the world of  electricity, including the plunging costs of renewables and the buzz of  innovation at the <a href=""http://grist.org/article/whats-threatening-utilities-innovation-at-the-edge-of-the-grid/"">distribution edge of the grid</a>, where electricity use is getting smarter and more efficient.</p> \n<p>But as our own Brad  Plumer is fond of <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/3/31/8319859/electricity-vs-energy"">reminding us</a>, there's more to energy than electricity.  Electricity  accounts for around 40 percent of America's energy  consumption and a roughly comparable slice of its carbon emissions. Most of the rest is oil for transportation, along with oil and natural gas for the industrial sector. In many ways, those are more daunting challenges than electricity. There are increasingly economic sources for clean power, but energy for heavy transportation (planes, trucks, trains) and high-intensity industrial applications remains stubbornly liquid and fossil. The fight to kill dirty electricity is only the beginning.</p> \n<p>That said, the past few  decades have seen one story after another about clean energy outstripping projections and expectations. Chait is right that clean technology development seems to have  entered into a mutually reinforcing cycle with policy development.  Things will only speed up from here.</p> \n<p>So Chait's technological optimism is legit, earning a solid 8 on our plausibility scale.</p> \n<h3>US policy progress: 7</h3> \n<p>One thing Chait is correct to emphasize is that recent progress in clean energy technology has been driven not by the magic invisible hand of the market, but by policy. Though the  cap-and-trade bill failed in 2010, the stimulus bill gave a huge boost  to renewable energy, and EPA regulations have played a key role in shutting down US coal and boosting renewables. And fuel economy standards have helped begin the long task of squeezing oil out of the transportation sector.</p> \n<p>There is good reason to believe that policy will continue to drive a shift to clean energy, and that the shift will in turn make further policy progress easier. But there is a <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/8/6/9110093/climate-change-2016-election"">very large caveat</a>:  Because most of Obama's clean energy policies have been accomplished  through executive action, their survival depends entirely on the next  executive.</p> \n<p>Hillary Clinton has said that protecting the Clean Power Plan will be a top priority. Needless to say, President Trump will not look upon it so kindly. And the next president can sabotage fuel economy  standards, ozone rules, and any of a dozen more small-bore actions the  Obama administration has taken in the past few years.</p> \n<p>If another Democrat wins the presidency, the current dynamic will likely continue: slow,  incremental progress in coal-heavy states, driven by federal  standards, alongside more rapid, ambitious progress in states like California.</p> \n<h3>International political progress: 6</h3> \n<p>International climate meetings have always been frustrating, more squabbling and grand declarations of intent than concrete policy agendas. But Chait is right that things seem to have shaken loose lately. The long and futile quest for the Ultimate Binding Treaty seems finally to have been abandoned, in favor of a framework whereby countries make voluntary pledges and commit to transparent monitoring and verification of their progress.</p> \n<p>This lowering of expectations has, in a somewhat paradoxical way, allowed countries to emerge from their defensive crouches and begin showing some ambition, led by the recent bilateral pact between the US and China — countries that until recently used one another as excuses for inaction, but now seem to be doing the opposite.</p> \n<p>However, as any climate activist will tell you, all those voluntary pledges <a href=""http://roadtoparis.info/2015/03/06/adding-up-indcs-what-country-commitments-could-mean-for-climate-change/"">do not yet add up</a> to action sufficient to meet the 2 degree target on which all countries have, at least symbolically, agreed. Adaptation funding, via the Green Climate Fund, remains <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2015/sep/04/climate-change-western-states-fail-to-fulfil-pledges-to-developing-countries"">gummed up and inadequate</a>.  And of course there are plenty of people who still think that the lack of legally binding protocols render the whole exercise little more than symbolism.</p> \n<p>So international climate talks are doing better than they typically have been (a low bar), but it's a little early to say that the world has truly gotten serious about tackling the problem.</p> \n<h3>China political progress: 5</h3> \n<p>Chait is right to mock Republicans for saying that US action won't make any difference because China won't reciprocate — and then ignoring or dismissing it  when China reciprocates. In fact, China is dumping <a href=""http://www.bbc.com/news/business-33143176"">enormous resources</a> into clean energy and placing increasingly stringent  <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/mclifford/2015/09/03/chinas-economic-slowdown-we-may-have-seen-peak-coal/"">limits on coal</a>. China's coal use <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/5/22/8645455/china-emissions-coal-drop"">declined in 2014</a>, for the first time this century.</p> \n<p>That said, let's be real: China's coal use remains <a href=""http://www.climatecentral.org/blogs/chinas-growing-coal-use-is-worlds-growing-problem-16999"">monstrous</a> — it uses over half the world's coal — and all the new coal plants it has built in the last decade will remain in operation for 40 or 50 years, putting a floor on its efforts to reduce coal use. For all its recent movement on carbon ambition, which will probably end up exceeding what it says are its official targets, it is still a long, long way from a trajectory commensurate with 2 degrees. And its overriding goal remains economic development.</p> \n<h3>Developing country progress: 4</h3> \n<p>Chait says:</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>The  energy revolution in China has laid the groundwork for a future  scarcely anybody could have imagined just a few years ago. For most of  the 1.3 billion people globally without access to electricity, building  new solar power is already cheaper than fossil-fuel generation. And so,  the possibility has come into view that, just as the developing world is  skipping landlines and moving straight into cellular communication, it  will forgo the dirty-energy path and follow a clean one. The global poor  can create a future of economic growth for themselves without burning  the world.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>That's a lovely idea, and I hope it's true. Last year, I wrote a pair of posts — <a href=""http://grist.org/food/how-can-we-get-power-to-the-poor-without-frying-the-planet/"">one</a>, <a href=""http://grist.org/climate-energy/how-can-we-get-power-to-the-worlds-poor-fastest/"">two</a> — addressing this set of issues: energy poverty and the dilemma of  getting energy to the poor without frying the planet. It is thorny and complicated, to say the least.</p> \n<p>It is very difficult and expensive to extend the  central power grid to poor people in the rural hinterlands of Africa and  India. For many of those people, there is an increasing array of  choices available for small-scale, affordable clean energy. That clean energy — not only solar panels but solar hot water, solar stoves, solar lamps, and other modular solar tech — can help offer rural residents basic services like light and refrigeration. That's nothing to sniff at. A little bit of energy makes a life-changing difference at that level.</p> \n<p>So sure, the 2 billion or so who lack energy access can get started, now, with  distributed clean energy technology.</p> \n<p>But that's a very different  undertaking than lifting all those people — or empowering them to lift  themselves — to a level of energy access and affluence that matches, or even approaches, that enjoyed by citizens of developed Western nations.</p> \n<p>Clean energy is a road out of abject poverty, but is it a road to full industrialization? That remains very much an open question. Right now, as Plumer has <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/7/7/8908179/coal-global-climate-change"">reminded us</a>,  even as coal is peaking or declining in the US and China, it is on the  rise in growing economies like Vietnam and Indonesia. And it is on the rise globally.</p> \n<p>So in a sense it's too late for developing countries to ""leapfrog"" over the dirty energy path. They are already <i>on</i> the dirty energy path. Their task, like everyone else's, is to drag themselves off of it. And they have to do it in a context where economic development is, morally and pragmatically, the overwhelming priority.</p> \n<p>It may be possible. But it is way, way too early to say so for sure, much less to say that it's happening.</p> \n<h3>The f'ing movement: 9</h3> \n<p>The gaping hole in Chait's piece? He has written the grassroots climate movement(s) out of existence. All he says about environmentalists is that they ""sank into despair"" after the cap-and-trade bill failed.</p> \n<p>Activist Tim DeChristopher's <a href=""http://www.timdechristopher.org/sunny_climate_nonsense"">rant about Chait's piece</a> is completely over-the-top and paints an absurd caricature of Chait, but he's justifiably angry about this. As he says, it's not just ""environmentalists"" now — the climate justice movement is far broader than that and includes many other constituencies. And they did not sink into despair when the cap-and-trade bill (which they hated) died; they organized. Chait may not like the fact that the movement rallied around Keystone XL, but rally it did. And it's beyond absurd that Chait mentions the closing of hundreds of coal plants in the US without mentioning the grassroots <a href=""http://www.politico.com/agenda/story/2015/05/inside-war-on-coal-000002"">Beyond Coal movement</a> that was so crucially instrumental in bringing it about.</p> \n<p>Chait has always had a beef with the <a href=""http://www.newrepublic.com/article/the-lefts-new-machine-how-the-netroots-became-the-most-importantmass-movement-us-politics"">left activists in general</a> and <a href=""http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2013/10/keystone-fight-a-huge-environmentalist-mistake.html"">climate activists specifically</a>. I personally think it's gotten a bit personal with him and distorted his otherwise typically lucid political analysis. But psychologizing aside, it's a little crazy to write about humanity getting serious about saving itself without even mentioning the growing grassroots movement that has dedicated itself to doing just that.</p> \n<h3>Overall optimism verdict: 7</h3> \n<p>Based on the complex mathematical modeling underlying my plausibility scale (please see appendices for more), and assessed from the standpoint of present-day political economy, Chait's piece receives an overall optimism plausibility score of 7, which is pretty dang high. It's certainly a hell of a lot higher than would have been possible even a few years ago.</p> \n<p>The big picture on climate change remains overwhelming and fairly depressing. Even with all the positive developments Chait identifies, the status quo trajectory still <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/5/15/8612113/truth-climate-change"">leads to disaster</a>. But he is right that, for the first time in my lifetime, it looks like it might be a real fight.</p>",Transportation
The transformative potential of self-driving electric cars,http://www.vox.com/2015/9/25/9398063/self-driving-electric-cars,"They're more than substitutes for gas cars. They are game changers. Game changers, I tell you!","<p>Public discussions about electric vehicles, self-driving cars, and the future of transportation seem weirdly circumscribed to me. The value of alternative vehicles always seems to be judged against their ability to swap out for today's internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles.</p> \n<p>(By the way, a <a href=""http://www.epri.com/abstracts/Pages/ProductAbstract.aspx?ProductId=3002006881"">massive new report</a> from the Electric Power Research Institute finds that swapping out ICE vehicles for electric vehicles would bring enormous benefits indeed, in both greenhouse gas reductions and local air quality.)</p> \n<p>But viewing electric vehicles and self-driving cars simply as substitutes for ICE vehicles misses the forest for the trees. The enormous bulk of the potential lies not in replacing units in today's transportation system, but in <i>generating new systems</i>. It is the system benefits that are at once most difficult to predict and most rich with possibility.</p> \n<p>Just as in the power sector, in transportation we are about to witness the collision of an irresistible force (new technology) and an immovable object (existing infrastructure). Political realism and lack of imagination — often one and the same — can prevent us from thinking and talking about what kind of world might be possible if the immovable object could be ... moved.</p> \n<p>So I want to get a little utopian. Autonomous electric vehicles (AEVs) have the potential to completely transform urban landscapes, which in turn can transform how those who live in cities interact. It's heady stuff. Let's get excited!</p> \n<h3>Traditional cars are overengineered; AEVs can right-size</h3> \n<p>Back in 2010, I <a href=""http://prospect.org/article/how-youll-get-there-0"">reviewed</a> a book called <i><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0262013827?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=theamerpros-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0262013827"">Reinventing the Automobile: Personal Urban Mobility for the 21st Century</a></i>. It is super, super nerdy, written by engineers, but it opened my eyes to one of the key advantage electric vehicles have over traditional ICE cars. Here's how the authors put it:</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>A traditional [ICE] car requires elaborate systems of reservoirs, tubes, valves, and pumps to distribute the gasoline, oil, water, air, and exhaust gases, but a battery-electric automobile replaces most of these complicated distribution systems with wires connecting the batteries to the wheels.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>The basic system for electric mobility is simpler than an ICE engine, by a wide margin. For an electric vehicle, you need four components:</p> \n<ol> \n<li>A wheel or wheels, each containing an electric motor</li> \n<li>A platform of some kind, to carry a battery and the passenger(s)</li> \n<li>A user interface</li> \n<li>Wires to connect 1 through 3</li> \n</ol> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""4095906"">\n<img src=""https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4095906/trexa-ev-platform.jpg""> \n<div class=""caption""> \n<p>A basic electric vehicle platform, from a company called Trexa. This one's got the electric motors in the central tube, which allows different suspension/wheel combinations to be swapped out.</p> \n</div> \n</div> \n<p>That's it. What becomes clear when you think about it this way is that there is an almost unlimited array of form factors an electric vehicle could take. It could have one or two wheels with a gyroscope (e.g., a Segway), three wheels, four wheels in a diamond shape or the traditional rectangle, six wheels, retractable wheels. It could be a modular vehicle on which wheels can be added or removed. It could be the traditional long, low chassis, an upright chassis, or any other shape or orientation of chassis you can imagine. The user interface could be a touchscreen, a joystick, pedals, levers, or, in the case of a self-driving car, nothing.</p> \n<p>Electric vehicles are <a href=""https://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/evtech.shtml"">intrinsically more efficient</a> than ICE vehicles:</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>Electric vehicles convert about 59%–62% of the electrical energy from the grid to power at the wheels—conventional gasoline vehicles only convert about 17%–21% of the energy stored in gasoline to power at the wheels.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>But they are more efficient in another way as well: Their simplicity and flexibility mean they can be right-sized, designed for a fine-grained array of transportation uses.</p> \n<h3>Transportation infrastructure is overengineered; AEVs can right-size</h3> \n<p>ICE vehicles are designed for peak use — driving long distances at high speeds. And because all ICE vehicles are overengineered, they're also big and heavy, which means they must be highly up-armored against collisions from other big, heavy, fast-moving vehicles. All that armor makes them even bigger and heavier. And so on.</p> \n<p>Basically, we're all driving around in quasi-military vehicles, designed to go 100 miles an hour for 300 miles. Yet most of the time, we drive to work and the grocery store, slowly, in traffic. Actually, scratch that: About <a href=""http://www.reinventingparking.org/2013/02/cars-are-parked-95-of-time-lets-check.html"">95 percent of the time</a>, we aren't driving at all; we leave our cars and trucks sitting, parked.</p> \n<p>Just like ICE vehicles themselves, the urban transportation system of roads and parking is designed for times of peak use. Parking is scaled for maximum traffic — covering <a href=""http://www.powells.com/biblio/9780262017336?&amp;PID=25450"">up to one-third</a> of urban land in some cities — which means most spaces are sitting empty most of the time.</p> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""4095908"">\n<img src=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4095908/matt-johnson-parking-lot.jpg""> \n<div class=""caption""> \n<p>A dumb use of valuable land.</p> \n</div> \n</div> \n<p>Self-driving vehicles open up different options. And since we're in utopian mode, let's not think about how current urban infrastructure could be repurposed; instead, let's imagine what urban structure might be built from scratch around AEVs.</p> \n<p>The signal direction of modern technology is to replace machinery, infrastructure, and commodities with <i>intelligence</i>, i.e., with computing power, which is on an inexorable march downward in cost. If vehicles become much smarter, it enables a concomitant reduction in machinery, infrastructure, and commodities.</p> \n<p>Begin with the fact that AEVs would radically reduce (and eventually all but eliminate) accidents. If AEVs were piloting through a landscape of slow-moving AEVs, bicyclists, and pedestrians, there would be far less need for up-armoring against collision. That means AEVs could be far, far smaller and lighter, increasing their range and reducing their land-use needs, their impact on surfaces, and the environmental impact of their manufacture.</p> \n<p>Consider how AEVs might transform transportation into a service. Imagine a fleet of shared AEVs, of varying sizes and purposes, that can be summoned with a smartphone app — dare I say it, an Uber, but for self-driving cars. (This is not Jetsons futurism; Tesla is already <a href=""http://www.autoblog.com/2015/08/07/tesla-ride-sharing-earnings-update/"">pondering it</a>.) If right-sized transportation were available to everyone within minutes, there would be no need for every individual to own a vehicle that is parked 95 percent of the time.</p> \n<p>When they are not in use, AEVs could drive themselves to specially designated parking garages, where they could be <a href=""http://web.mit.edu/francov/www/citycar/"">stacked</a> much closer than human-piloted vehicles and plugged into the electrical grid, where they can serve as distributed energy storage. There would effectively be no need for any <i>other</i> parking, especially on-street parking, and there would be no distracted, frustrated human beings driving around looking for parking.</p> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""4095900"">\n<img src=""https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4095900/mit-citystack-car.jpg""> \n<div class=""caption""> \n<p>Stacked citycars.</p> \n</div> \n</div> \n<p>Small, lightweight AEVs vastly expand the possibilities for shared use of urban spaces. In 2010, hotshot architect Bjarke Ingels won the <a href=""http://audi-urban-future-initiative.com/blog/bjarke-ingels-group"">Audi Urban Future Award</a> for his concept of a driverless city. Here's the capsule summary:</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>We imagine that inner cities that are currently banning cars through taxation or tolls to relieve congestion will simply become driverless rather than car-less. Driverless cars will combine individual mobility outside city limits with collective mobility within; as selfdriven cars move in coordinated concert with their fellow commuters, they occupy a quarter of the space human-driven cars require. As the new generation of cars will additionally be noiseless and pollutionless it will mean the end of the apartheid that currently separates cars from pedestrians and bicyclists for comfort, health or safety reasons. The result is an elastic urban space that can expand and contract to accommodate peak traffic hours or allow a park or plaza to invade the car lanes to fit the demands and desires of its citizens. Picture a future city in 25 years where the vertical facades appear unchanged, but the city pavement is transformed into a reprogrammable surface, replacing the fixed elements of driveway, sidewalk or square into a digital street surface that is completely re-animating a familiar city.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""4095748"">\n<img src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4095748/ingels-audi-city-1.jpg""> \n<div class=""caption""> \n<p>The future is groovy.</p> \n</div> \n</div> \n<p>In effect, the city would reconfigure itself in real time around changing patterns of land-use demands.

With current technology, or at least technology plausibly within reach, city infrastructure could be infused with sensors and communications that enable every AEV to know exactly where demand is high, congestion is developing, and the fastest routes are. There may be things that humans can do better than computers, but traffic is not one of them.</p> \n<p>This world is also likely to feature less air pollution. It is true, as we're <a href=""http://www.takepart.com/article/2014/12/18/where-you-plug-your-electric-car-makes-big-difference-how-clean-it"">incessantly</a> <a href=""http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/2015/sep/09/carbon-price-electric-vehicles/"">reminded</a>, that EVs are only as clean as the electricity that fills their batteries. But the US grid is getting cleaner, and that process is expected to continue. (In fact, electrifying the vehicle fleet could help get more renewable energy on the grid faster, as it could serve, in effect, as dispatchable demand to soak up excess solar or wind energy.)</p> \n<h3>Transportation utopia is a long way off, for these dream-crushing reasons</h3> \n<p>Were one the type to crush utopian dreams, one could cite one of the following families of concerns:</p> \n<h4><b>1) Path dependence and the risk of more sprawl</b></h4> \n<p>The Chinese get to <a href=""http://www.popsci.com/technology/article/2012-10/carefully-engineered-chinese-pocket-city-will-fight-sprawl-building-not-out"">build futuristic cities from scratch</a>, but in the developed world we no longer have that luxury. There's a whole bunch of built infrastructure already in place, and, especially in the US, it is designed for cars. Where there is built infrastructure, there are sunk costs and vested interests. That creates an enormous amount of path dependence, which will shape future developments.</p> \n<p>That helps explain why many urbanists are suspicious of or even hostile toward self-driving cars. They <a href=""http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2014/05/30/3442311/self-driving-sprawl/"">worry</a> that by meliorating some of the current problems with cars — accidents, congestion, pollution — they will sap any political will to solve the more fundamental problem, which is that <i>any</i> system that relies primarily on individual vehicles will prevent the kind of urban density that's desirable for <a href=""http://grist.org/smart-cities/2011-05-25-great-places-dense-wired-sustainable/"">environmental</a> and many <a href=""http://grist.org/cities/2011-05-31-great-places-smart-density-economic-flourishing/"">other reasons</a>.</p> \n<p>More prosaically, they point out that it will raise demand for individual vehicles, opening them to whole populations, including those under 16 and <a href=""http://www.wsj.com/articles/why-self-driving-cars-will-change-retirement-1413147945"">older people</a> with fading vision and reflexes, to whom they are now inaccessible. And it will make for easier and more pleasant commutes, enabling housing to sprawl farther outward.</p> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""4095918"">\n<img src=""https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4095918/google-aev-prototype.jpg""> \n<div class=""caption""> \n<p>Google's adorable self-driving car prototype.</p> \n</div> \n</div> \n<p>David Edmondson has a good rundown of the issue <a href=""https://thegreatermarin.wordpress.com/2015/02/16/what-do-driverless-cars-mean-for-suburban-planning/"">here</a> and makes the point that AEVs are just as likely to transform suburbia as they are to enable it. No parking lots, no gas stations, no big eight-lane arterials, storefronts up against the sidewalk ... it's not very sprawly, because ""this transportation cloud functions much more like the streetcars of the old days than personal cars of today.""</p> \n<p>My educated guess is that AEVs will make dense city centers more, not less, appealing, by enabling transportation as a service, radically reducing noise, air, and aesthetic pollution, and opening up new mixed-use urban streetscapes. But it's probably just too early to tell.</p> \n<h4><b>2) Big Brother</b></h4> \n<p>The discussion of smart cities has been dominated by technophiles and big corporations, which means the substantial <a href=""https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0CB4QFjAAahUKEwj5l4PfzJHIAhUIoogKHUazA1o&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wsj.com%2Farticles%2Fsmart-cities-will-know-everything-about-you-1436740596&amp;usg=AFQjCNGmje9Mh4T6ua6LDzGjsFRGMxkU7A&amp;sig2=P69qm-5kYHN_F7Rt1CtGug"">privacy issues</a> involved have not exactly gotten a full airing. But ""smart"" means information, and a city filled with sensors and trackers will accumulate a <i>lot</i> of information about every citizen within it. Who owns that information? Who can access it? How much will basic services like transportation hinge on the surrender of personal data? How will all that data be protected from the copious <a href=""http://www.hldataprotection.com/2015/06/articles/consumer-privacy/nist-tackles-cybersecurity-in-the-smart-city/"">cybersecurity threats</a> that face smart cities?</p> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""4095924"">\n<img src=""https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4095924/city-surveillance.jpg""> \n<div class=""caption""> \n<p>Look how smart this city is.</p> \n</div> \n</div> \n<p>Focusing in on AEVs, there's the simple fact that humans will be surrendering control of the hundreds of second-to-second micro-decisions involved in driving. In many cases, those decisions have an <a href=""http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/10/the-ethics-of-autonomous-cars/280360/"">ethical dimension</a>. How will the AEV make them? What programming and algorithms are involved? Who decides how priorities are set?</p> \n<p>Much like the internet, the connected transportation net of the future opens all sorts of utopian possibilities, but it is also subject to capture by corporations and nosy government surveillance types — who, the historical record shows, have a way of boxing out the utopians.</p> \n<p> \n<style>[href^=""http://www.google.com/aclk?""],[href^=""http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/external-search?""] \n{display:none !important;}</style> \n</p>",Transportation
The biggest challenge for driverless cars: getting rid of the drivers,http://www.vox.com/2015/10/7/9471393/driverless-cars-challenges,The full benefits of driverless cars will only arrive when those pesky humans are out of the picture.,"<p>It's easy to dream about a future full of autonomous electric vehicles (AEVs), in which combustion engines have been relegated to history, transportation is a service, and urban spaces are adaptable and multimodal, shared by AEVs, bikes, and pedestrians in shifting configurations. I did a little <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/9/25/9398063/self-driving-electric-cars"">utopian musing</a> about it last week.</p> \n<p>What's more difficult is envisioning the path from here to there.</p> \n<p>As I see it, AEVs face two fundamental challenges. Both take the form of an ""uncanny valley"" between partial automation and full automation. It's impossible to predict which challenge will be overcome first, or how, or how the two challenges might interact ... but it's fun to speculate!</p> \n<h3>AEV challenge No. 1: unreliable drivers</h3> \n<p>One route that self-driving vehicles might take to the mass market is incremental. It begins with systems that assist drivers in certain conditions — parking, changing lanes, cruising in highway traffic. Perhaps there's a ping, an alarm of some sort, or a nudge of the steering wheel one way or the other.</p> \n<p>These assistive systems are already being introduced.

Instead, it will pull together a number of smart systems intended to take some of the repetition out of more predictable driving, like on freeways.</p> \n<p>So, there'll be hands-off lane following, braking, and speed control while on the highway.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Super Cruise, GM <a href=""http://www.slashgear.com/gm-super-cruise-self-driving-car-tech-gets-virtual-playpen-21325942/"">says</a>, ""is being positioned as a safety and driver assistance feature, taking on some of the cognitive load in freeway driving and bumper-to-bumper traffic.""</p> \n<p><img src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4135684/robot-driver.0.jpg"" alt=""robot-driver.0.jpg"" data-chorus-asset-id=""4135684""></p> \n<p class=""caption"">The future of self-driving cars, maybe. (Shutterstock)</p> \n<p>Audi will introduce <a href=""http://www.slashgear.com/audi-puts-self-driving-a7-on-road-in-highway-testing-28338952/"">""Traffic Jam Pilot""</a> to its vehicles in the next few years, which will do similar things. It also notes:</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>[U]nlike Google's self-driving ""pod"" cars which will begin their own trials imminently, Audi says drivers will still need to be alert and ready to take over, particularly as low-speed traffic jams give way to regular highway speeds.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>And therein lies the rub.</p> \n<p>As assistive systems get more sophisticated and are able to handle more varieties of routine traffic, they will take more and more of the ""cognitive load"" off of the driver. Soon the driver will only need to be paying close attention 75 percent of the time, then 50 percent of the time, then 25 percent of the time.</p> \n<p>Then you start reaching the uncanny valley. Can we trust human drivers who are inattentive 75 percent of the time to pay attention the right 25 percent of the time, and to make the right decisions? What if autonomous systems get really good and the driver can tune out 95 percent of the time? Do we trust that driver to snap to and pilot the vehicle capably during the 5 percent?</p> \n<p>It's an issue already <a href=""http://www.newyorker.com/science/maria-konnikova/hazards-automation"">facing the airline industry</a>, as autopilot becomes more capable and pilots' skill and judgment begins to atrophy:</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>... as pilots were being freed of these responsibilities, they were becoming increasingly susceptible to boredom and complacency—problems that were all the more insidious for being difficult to identify and assess. As one pilot whom Wiener interviewed put it: ""I know I’m not in the loop, but I’m not exactly out of the loop. It’s more like I’m flying alongside the loop.""</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>As drivers are increasingly ""driving alongside the loop,"" will they too succumb to boredom and complacency and start making dumb errors?</p> \n<p>It seems likely. In fact, in California, piloting an autonomous vehicle already requires a <a href=""http://spectrum.ieee.org/cars-that-think/transportation/human-factors/will-you-need-a-new-license-to-operate-a-selfdriving-car"">special license</a>. ""Humans aren’t hardwired to sit and monitor a system for long periods of time and then quickly react properly when an emergency happens,"" said Patrick Lin of California Polytechnic State University.</p> \n<p>Perhaps the safety benefits of autonomous systems will outweigh those errors. But it's likely to cause quite a bit of social friction along the way.</p> \n<p>So maybe Google has it right. Maybe the way to solve the uncanny valley problem is to vault right over it, straight to 100 percent autonomous vehicles. That's what the company's done with its <a href=""https://www.google.com/selfdrivingcar/"">latest prototype</a>.</p> \n<p>But AEVs face a second challenge.</p> \n<h3>AEV challenge No. 2: unreliable traffic</h3> \n<p>Move back from the driver-vehicle perspective to the vehicle-traffic perspective, and you find another uncanny valley.</p> \n<p>Consider: If there were <em>only</em> AEVs on the road (along with bikes and pedestrians), then the full benefits of AEVs would be unlocked. All vehicles would not only be ""smart,"" they would be communicating with one another, acting in concert. Serious accidents would fall to virtually nil.</p> \n<p>Bikes and pedestrians would remain somewhat unpredictable and might cause a few accidents. But AEVs driving among other AEVs could be much, much lighter, and they would move more slowly through crowded spaces, so there would be nothing like the terrible toll of today's traffic.</p> \n<p>But if there are even a few heavy, fast internal combustion vehicles piloted by human beings on the road — say, 10 percent of traffic — then the benefits of AEVs drop sharply. For one thing, to meet safety standards, they have to be up-armored against collision with very heavy vehicles, which in turn makes them much heavier, reducing their range and flexibility.</p> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""4135624"">\n<img src=""https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4135624/road-rage.jpg""> \n<div class=""caption""> \n<p>No robot should have to deal with this.</p> \n</div> \n</div> \n<p>For another, as long as there are unpredictable, human-piloted vehicles on the road, AEVs will be forced into making <a href=""http://www.technologyreview.com/news/539731/how-to-help-self-driving-cars-make-ethical-decisions/"">weird ethical judgments</a> like this: ""a child suddenly dashing into the road, forcing the self-driving car to choose between hitting the child or swerving into an oncoming van.""</p> \n<p>Should the AEV prioritize its own driver? Should it sacrifice its own driver to save the younger victim? Should it rank outcomes by total cost? By lives at risk? These are thorny dilemmas that will also create considerable social friction (and inevitable lawsuits).</p> \n<p>Here's the thing: If the oncoming van is also an AEV, it's not a problem if a child dashes into the road. The two vehicles will communicate and coordinate the best way to swerve or stop without touching each other or the child.</p> \n<p>But if the oncoming van is piloted by a human — or even <em>might</em> be — all those ethical dilemmas arise, simply because the van's behavior can't be reliably predicted.</p> \n<p>It really seems like to fully unlock the benefits of AEVs, you need to push the last of the internal combustion engines and human pilots off the road. And that seems a distant prospect.</p> \n<p>Virtually all automakers are making their vehicles smarter at a rapid pace, and fully autonomous vehicles are being tested in real-world traffic today.  One Japanese prefecture is testing a fleet of <a href=""http://blogs.wsj.com/japanrealtime/2015/10/01/robocab-driverless-taxi-experiment-to-start-in-japan/?mod=trending_now_3"">""robot taxis""</a> that mix in normal traffic. Google is sending self-driving Lexus SUVs to <a href=""http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2015/07/07/google-starts-testing-driverless-car-in-austin/"">cruise around</a> a few blocks of Austin, Texas (and <a href=""http://venturebeat.com/2015/09/18/google-starts-testing-its-custom-built-self-driving-cars-in-austin-texas/"">now its AEVs, too</a>). Honda recently <a href=""http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/09/10/us-honda-autos-self-driving-idUSKCN0RA2G820150910"">got a permit</a> to put its autonomous cars on California streets. Uber has a permit to <a href=""http://spectrum.ieee.org/cars-that-think/transportation/self-driving/uber-could-be-first-to-test-completely-driverless-cars-in-public"">test autonomous vehicles</a> in Arizona.

If they demonstrate the system benefits of AEVs (substantially beyond what AEVs can offer when mixing with normal cars), they could catch on in city centers, corporate campuses, or resort towns, spreading over time.</p> \n<div data-chorus-asset-id=""4095758"">\n<img src=""https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4095758/ingels-audi-city-2.jpg""> \n<div class=""caption""> \n<p>The city of the future, with AEVs and people mingling, apparently on the set of <i>Tron</i>.</p> \n</div> \n</div> \n<h3>Questions about AEVs will be answered soon enough</h3> \n<p>Whether we're prepared or not, AEVs are coming.

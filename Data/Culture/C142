HBO will let you watch their shows online â€” without having to buy cable
HBO is about to change the way we watch their shows. At the Time Warner Inc. Investor Meeting Wednesday morning, Richard Plepler, the chairman and CEO of HBO, announced that the company will offer a stand-alone HBO streaming service in 2015.  "That is a large and growing opportunity that should no longer be left untapped.  It is time to remove all barriers to those who want HBO," Plepler said.    "So, in 2015, we will launch a stand-alone, over-the-top, HBO service in the United States. We will work with our current partners.  And, we will explore models with new partners.  All in, there are 80 million homes that do not have HBO and we will use all means at our disposal to go after them." More  es for us all. Get our newsletter in your inbox twice a week.

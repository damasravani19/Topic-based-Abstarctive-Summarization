Thereâ€™s a Toy Story Christmas special airing tonight, and itâ€™s wonderful
There is a new   on tonight, and it is wonderful. If you like the characters or the world of the film series, you owe it to yourself to check this out. It airs on ABC at 8 pm Eastern and is followed by the classic  , so you have a full hour of holiday delights on tap. Though there's  ,  's shift to becoming a series of   and   has proved surprisingly effective. The characters are beloved enough that they carry over enormous amounts of goodwill from their previous endeavors, and the shorter formats allow the creative team behind the projects to explore various bits of the world of toys that the three films couldn't get into, either because they were too esoteric or because they were one-joke concepts. (Consider, for instance,  , which is all about toys at bathtime. That's not a great idea for a feature, but it makes a great short film.) Tonight's special,  , is only nominally about the holiday season. It opens in the immediate aftermath of presents being unwrapped, before immediately jumping to a playdate between the toys' owner Bonnie and a young boy named Mason. This being a   project, things immediately go wrong, but in a fashion that calls back to the franchise's frequent explorations of what happens when kids ignore their toys and don't play with them. Strangely, the brains behind   seem to believe that most toys would degenerate into some sort of Venn diagram intersection between " " and "religious cult" without proper supervision, and   offers up just this, with a bunch of so-called Battlesaurs (just what it sounds like), who have formed their own society in Mason's bedroom. Neglected in favor of a video game console, the toys have formed an elaborate society seemingly based on the rules of those '80s cartoons designed to sell toys. (There are a lot of knowing winks to all the   out there.) Thus, the new special embraces another part of a toy's life that the films couldn't explore — the post-present unwrapping glut of playing with all the new toys — while simultaneously allowing for another strength of the post-films   franchise to take wing. The shorts and specials have turned their focus away from Woody and Buzz, for the most part, and toward the franchise's many, many enjoyable supporting characters. Here, that focus is on Trixie the Triceratops, voiced by  , and her work is a reminder that Schaal is one of the best voice actors in the business. Schaal's voice is so distinctive that this might seem impossible, but Trixie is different from Louise,  , or Mabel,  Trixie didn't get a lot of screentime in the films themselves, but Schaal's gifts always made for an intriguing hint of what might be possible with the character. Here's the payoff to that. Okay, and you should also watch this because of a new character called Kittysaurus. I will say no more. Get our newsletter in your inbox twice a week.

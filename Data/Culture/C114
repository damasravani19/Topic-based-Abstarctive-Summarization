 Astute fans ofÂ   will recognize these quotes as famous ones from the series. What the hell does this mean? Nobody knows, outside of the fact that these are quotes from the show, and Lynch has teased a   reunion for years. Maybe Lynch and Frost just got together with series star Kyle MacLachlan for pie, and they all had a great time reminiscing. Maybe Netflix called the two up and said, "Hey, make us another season." Maybe David Lynch just thought this would be sort of funny, and got Mark Frost to go along with it. But, hey, we would watch some more  . We'll bet a lot of other people would, too. Think about it, Netflix or Hulu or Yahoo Screen or Amazon or Crackle or obscure cable channel to be named later! Get our newsletter in your inbox twice a week.

Binge-watch some of 2014â€™s best TV so far
Need recommendations for binge-watching? You probably already know about the   and  s of the world, but if you're looking for something slightly more obscure, here are 25 great shows that are already in contention for best of 2014 lists. You can watch all of them in a weekend — and some of them in a single afternoon. What else do you have to do?  A wide-ranging journey through the land of Ooo,   is a great many things: hilarious comedy, inventive children’s cartoon, and pathos-ridden tragedy. But it is, above all else, a show about growing up, as its twin protagonists — Finn the Human and Jake the Dog — learn about getting older, accepting responsibility, and becoming who they were meant to be.    ’s power has a tendency to sneak up on you. Because it unfolds in bite-sized chunks of 11 minutes, the story’s epic sweep only reveals itself very gradually. That makes it the perfect project for a binge watch — the show’s surprisingly subtle and deep thematic layering will become all the more apparent as dozens of episodes roll by.     crossed with Looney Tunes.   The first three seasons are on DVD. The rest are available for digital purchase. Ilana and Abbi (played by series creators and writers Ilana Glazer and Abbi Jacobson) are two young women trying to just scrape by in New York City with the bare minimum of effort. If other shows about twentysomethings are about those with lofty ambitions,   is about two deeply likable characters who just want to have fun.   Glazer and Jacobson are naturals at the center of this series, and with good reason: they created the web series on which it is based. This is pure, unfiltered snark, with a healthy dose of humor about what it's like to be young with a cash-flow problem in New York in 2014. It's like a series made by two people getting high in their dorm room who decide they should film themselves because they're really funny. Except, in this case, the characters actually are.    but wish it was 75 percent funnier.   It's available for digital purchase, and it can be streamed on Comedy Central's website and app. [if gte mso 9]><xml> 0   0   1   132   754   Vox Media   6   1   885   14.0 </xml><![endif]   [if gte mso 9]><xml> Normal   0               false   false   false      EN-US   JA   X-NONE </xml><![endif] [if gte mso 9]><xml> </xml><![endif]   [if gte mso 10]>

<![endif] One of the most instantly self-assured network sitcoms in years, this new Fox series broke through in a big way this year. Set among the police officers of a precinct in (yes) Brooklyn, the show boasts a tight ensemble, sharp writing, and some great stories you haven't seen on a million other sitcoms already.   Do you need a better one than just "it's really funny"? Okay, well, the ensemble includes the Emmy-nominated Andre Braugher, Terry Crews, and Chelsea Peretti, to say nothing of Andy Samberg in a role where he quickly finds a way to fit into the cast without dominating it. Just watching actors work together is one of the chief pleasures of the American sitcom, and this show has so many great ones.    and  The complete first season is streaming on Hulu Plus, and it can also be purchased digitally.

The brothers at the center of this series (created by  's Kevin Biegel) argue with each other, but they also bear real, earned affection that keeps the show grounded. Not every episode is a classic, but enough are great to make you sad this one won't be back.   Classic workplace comedies.   It streams on Hulu Plus and is available for digital purchase.  Gay characters on television tend to hover around one note, and that note is usually some mix of sass and humor (see:  ). That isn't happening on  , the first mainstream show exclusively about gay men since  , and the first mainstream show exclusively about gay people since  . The show, which follows three gay men in San Francisco, shows that gay life can be quiet, sensitive, and the opposite of uproarious — and this is a good thing.   doesn't come out of the gate crackling — it's a thoughtful, slow-boil of a show. In one episode, two characters just meander around San Francisco. And its schedule on HBO — one 30-minute episode per week — puts too much breathing room in between each episode.

They're too old for childlike wonder, yet too young for the growing pains of adolescence.

<![endif] Comedian Nathan Fielder has a business degree from one of Canada's top universities. With the help of that business degree, he travels the lesser-seen parts of Los Angeles, trying to help struggling businesses turn around. Except his ideas are less helpful than they are ridiculous. Part reality show spoof, part cringe comedy, and part surprisingly genuine show about the entrepreneurial struggle,   found a wider audience in its second season and somehow managed to craft an even funnier season than the first. The show's comedic bits are some of the most unusual and inventive you'll ever see and are all the more notable for featuring real people instead of trained actors.

His best friend is a likable nerd who ends up falling for the hero's ex. The hero's dad, meanwhile, has a younger girlfriend from Thailand. The show follows the main character around as he tries to deal with all of these shenanigans.   Do you like awkward comedy and heartfelt sincerity?

<![endif] The life of an inner-city preacher might not seem to be good fodder for a TV show, but the British sitcom  , one of the freshest, funniest imports in years, turns that basic idea into a thoughtful meditation on what it means to follow God in an age when fewer and fewer people have use for organized religion.   In three seasons and 19 episodes,   is as thoughtful about faith as any TV series has ever been. It all starts with the series' lead, Tom Hollander, who also co-created the show and co-writes many episodes. He turns his character, Rev. Adam Smallbone, into a lovely examination of both human frailty and the power of devotion. The third season, which debuted earlier this year, is tremendous television.

It takes a few episodes to figure out what this warped romantic comedy is doing, but at its heart,   takes seriously the idea that everybody out there really does have someone made just for them. And in the case of those show, that means two of the worst people alive.   Except, truth be told, the show very quickly turns into something genuinely touching and — dare we say it? — a little bit sentimental.

There are quite a few spy stories out there, but this series, simultaneously emotionally brutal and deeply felt, has become one of the best in quite some time.

The show is one of TV's most diverse, and its inclusive spirit extends to even the most minor of bit players. And it's the medium's most quietly meaningful argument for the loving realities of both gay marriage and gay parents.    can be cheesy, but it always, always means well, and when it lands an emotional moment, there are few shows as good at eliciting tears as this one. In particular, the show is notable for depicting a wide variety of people from all walks of life and being both sensitive and empathetic to all of them.   Those old WB dramas,   especially.

<![endif]   The Hannibal Lecter franchise gets its umpteenth revival in this series, which might be the best adaptation yet of the story of the ultra-dapper serial killer. The series flashes back to the time he was on the loose and close friends with criminal profiler Will Graham.    This is one of TV's most provocative, beautiful shows, filled with stunning images that are unlike any in TV history. And the writing, from a team led by mad genius Bryan Fuller, delves deep into emotional intimacy in male friendships and the role of murder in modern society. Oh yeah, and it's one of TV's most impeccably acted shows, too.   The paintings of Hieronymous Bosch.   Season one is on DVD and streaming on Amazon Prime. Season two is available for digital purchase and will be on DVD next month.  This riveting miniseries — currently just past the halfway point of its run — turns Maggie Gyllenhaal loose on a spy story inspired by the Israeli/Palestinian conflict, and she’s gives a typically terrific performance. This is a great show for those who miss the days when   felt like a secret little treasure.  This one would be worth watching only for Gyllenhaal’s performance. Fortunately, however, it’s also a solid spy thriller — one that sometimes feels the need to over explain what it’s doing to the audience, but one that has such an involving story that you won’t much mind any of its minor issues.   British miniseries.  The show is airing on Sundance right now. It’s available for digital purchase.  On October 14, three years ago, 2 percent of the world’s population instantly vanished, leaving behind a world full of people to figure out what happened and try to get on with their lives. The show concentrates on the literal leftovers of Mapleton, New York, and follows the Garvey family as each member tries to heal their grief.   This is not your typical post-apocalyptic tale. For one thing, the plot isn’t gimmicky. Neither are the performances. The writing, led by   creator Damon Lindelof, is sharp, and, like  , understands that the best way to tell a story isn’t always in chronological order. The result is an ever-deepening mystery that twists and winds toward a conclusion that seems always just out of reach.     and   HBO Go.

<![endif]   The complete story of Bill Masters and Virginia Johnson, authors of one of the most important comprehensive sex studies to be published in the US, shouldn't work on TV, spanning many decades as it does. But, remarkably, the show, now halfway through its second season, finds a way to make these two scientists and their work into a show that's alternately funny and moving.   Though the second season has had its speed bumps,   is still a deeply intriguing examination of the weird intersection between love, intimacy, and sex. And in Michael Sheen and Lizzy Caplan, the series has two leads who can take any storyline they're handed and turn it into chemistry-laden gold.   The work of Dan Savage.   The first season is on DVD, and episodes can be purchased digitally. Showtime subscribers can watch the complete run on Showtime Anytime.

Yes, it’s a CBS show with a case-of-the-week structure. Yes, it had a lumpy first season. And yes, it’s probably a show your parents watch. But this is also one of the most up-to-the-minute shows on TV, a terrific examination of the surveillance state in strong sci-fi terms — that’s somewhat unexpectedly turned into a treatise on the potential pitfalls of artificial intelligence.   Of all of the shows on this list, this one will strain you the most if you try to finish it in a weekend. But once the show gets good — and it does in seasons two and three — you’re going to find it hard to stop watching. This is a Trojan horse series that sneaks very impressive, nuanced policy discussion into the middle of an otherwise typical CBS primetime drama.

<![endif]   A man is released from death row after nearly 20 years. He returns to his family and his life changed, at once more thoughtful and more withdrawn. Yet as he attempts to reintegrate into society, it sends ripples through his family and his community. These ripples threaten to tear apart relationships and overturn the sleepy town's established order.   Put that way,   sounds like the most melodramatic show ever, but it's really not. It's a moving, beautiful meditation on what it means to be alive, yet in its best episodes, it knits that idea to a surprisingly well-constructed story about whether the protagonist was guilty of the crime he was convicted of or not. This is the best show you're almost certainly not watching.   Good things.   The first season is streaming on Netflix and available on DVD. All episodes are available for digital purchase.  Dianna "Miss D" Williams runs the Dollhouse Dancing Factory, a dance studio that turns young girls with slap-dash gaits into hip-hop majorette dancing machines.   is equal parts comedy, inspiration, and drama, as it shows viewers how the Dancing Dolls' routines are built and executed and if they're good enough to win.   The dancing. The girls in this show can dance and are, for the most part, treated like athletes.   could easily devolve into something exploitative and paint the Dancing Dolls as caricatures, but there's a lot of respect here for the girls and Miss D — the dancing comes first.    .

This is a show about the most ultra-minute of minute topics, a show that has fun with questions we think we've known the answers to since childhood.

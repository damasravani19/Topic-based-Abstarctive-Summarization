Fox News covered street harassment by catcalling a victim on the air
After the video of a woman  went viral, Fox News decided that they, too, should voice an opinion on the matter. "I'm not gonna condone it, but I will tell you nothing was disrespectful there," Eric Bolling begins, "She may not have wanted it, but I find it very hard to believe there was verbal harassment going on. Am I wrong?" Yes, Eric. You are wrong. To knowingly say things to a woman on the street and assert your dominance . But that's not even the offensive part of this clip. Bob Beckel then adds,  To be clear, then, according to this Fox News panel, when a young woman is harassed on the street, it's her fault. When a highly paid male Fox News anchor harasses her on-air, it's adorable, something to be laughed off as an old dog unable to learn new tricks. This woman in this video, whom the Fox News panel is so eager to mock and dismiss,   for speaking out on behalf of other women. A woman  that there is more footage, some of which shows more serious forms of harassment. But yes, go ahead, back up the comfortable white man who wants to objectify her some more on national television. Get our newsletter in your inbox twice a week.

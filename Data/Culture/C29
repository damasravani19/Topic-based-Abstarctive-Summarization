Angelina Jolie's Maleficentâ€”the huge summer hit no one talked about

Released Memorial Day weekend, the most competitive time for summer movies,  had a big opening. But where   proved its popularity was in its staying power:  and had a higher multiplier (a good estimate of a movie's success after opening weekend) than  Yet, unlike many of the films  bested at the box office, critics pegged it as a children's movie, then quickly discounted it.

The movie is marketed to families, but it contains a difficult (if metaphorical) portrayal of rape. Jolie's Maleficent is a villain, but we want her to succeed. Those contradictions are what make  interesting, and they're part of the draw for audiences. " is an original story,"  , a  In what is far from a typical summer blockbuster movie performance, Jolie brought pain and anguish to the role. She understood she was telling a story about a woman who was betrayed and destroyed by a man she loved, and she brought that understanding and hurt to her role. That doesn't mean the movie was perfect. Though Jolie is a powerful force, the movie struggles to maintain a coherent tone throughout. There are several emotional scenes with incredible staying power, but at times it all feels more like a collection of moments than a full plot. Jolie's character is bewitching and mysterious, but she doesn't have a full character arc, and it's hard to see her development. Yet the movie has a raw, elemental power in its best moments. And that might have something to do with its fairy tale roots. Betsy Sharksey wrote for   that fairy tales have grown in popularity with adults because of "the way fables handle the subtext, using mystical worlds as a prism for problems, that allow us a fresh look without the tale being clouded by contemporary culture." is a fantastic example of this. Its subtext weaves a powerful myth about female empowerment.  "Consciously or not, coherently or not,   tells a new kind of story about how we live now, not once upon another time," Manohla Dargis wrote for   "And it does so by suggesting, among other things, that budding girls and older women are not natural foes, even if that's what fairy tales, Hollywood and the world like to tell us."

Female protagonists are rare in Hollywood, even in kids' fare, despite all those films about princesses.  Male characters outnumber female characters  in family films. This   has been a problem in Hollywood for a long time. According to  , women only accounted for 4.1 percent of directors, 12.2 percent of writers, and 20 percent of producers. "It's really a writing and imagination question," Thompson said. "Men are really uncomfortable with it. So we really need more women who can think and direct and write about women in a complex way." As a result, Thompson said, the male-dominated film industry continues to make films written and directed by men, starring men, for male audiences. And that leaves a huge portion of the population underserved. " was marketed and aimed squarely at a female audience," Thompson said. "There is an argument to be made that maybe Hollywood is coming around to the idea that they should include 50 percent of the population in their decisions." This transition in mindset is largely due to the fact that movies that star women, and portray them as full characters with desires and goals outside of traditional stereotypes, continue to succeed in the box office. Making headway in this category are movies like  (one of the most successful movies ever made) films and  These films show women in roles that aren't maternal, comforting, or sweet. The female protagonists here can be violent and horrible. They can be cruel to each other. Their stories can revolve around themselves, not around men. And audiences are eating it up.

Quiz: Hilary Duff's lyrics or a line from the short story The Yellow Wallpaper?
Hilary Duff, one time Disney Channel star and pop songstress behind such classics as   and "Come Clean," is in the process of working on a new studio album, her first since 2008. Duff's new song   is a notable departure from her previous work. It's more brooding, it rarely lets Duff's voice dip toward a whine, and it's, notably, much, much,   less insane. Starting in 2003, Duff released five studio albums in five years, each one stranger than the last. Her most famous song, by far, was " " which was released in 2003 and became the theme song for  , whose 10th anniversary we celebrate this weekend. By the time her 2008 album came out, the new lyrics had reached peak-wackadoo. Wait. But how wackadoo is " -wackadoo"? It's time to test your knowledge. Who said the following quote? Was it Hilary Duff in one of her many pop songs, or the narrator of Charlotte Perkins Gilman's "The Yellow Wallpaper"?

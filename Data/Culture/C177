Netflix is making a TV show out of A Series of Unfortunate Events
After great success with other original series, Netflix is about to make its first foray into live-action family entertainment by adapting Lemony Snicket's famous young adult book series  tells the story of the orphaned children Violet, Klaus and Sunny Baudelaire, who face many trials and misfortunes under the care of an evil uncle all the while trying to uncover the mysterious secret of their parents' deaths. The thirteen books in the series are dark, often funny, tales of misfortune and struggle peppered with good moral lessons. "On the search for fantastic material that appeals to both parents and kids, the first stop for generations of readers is A Series of Unfortunate Events," said Cindy Holland, VP Original Content at Netflix . "The world created by Lemony Snicket is unique, darkly funny and relatable. We can't wait to bring it to life for Netflix members." Netflix recently acquired the rights to the series, but has not cast or started production on the show. They will be working in tandem with Paramount Pictures, who produced a 2004 movie adaptation starring Jim Carrey that grossed $209 million worldwide. "I can't believe it,"Â   from an undisclosed location. "After years of providing top-quality entertainment on demand, Netflix is risking its reputation and its success by associating itself with my dismaying and upsetting books."

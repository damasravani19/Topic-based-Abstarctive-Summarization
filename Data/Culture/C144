This tweet shows that some gamers have become what they once most hated
Last night, feminist critic and YouTube host  , who is currently in the middle of a lengthy project dissecting sexist tropes in video games, was forced to  , after an anonymous letter threatened a mass shooting should her speech proceed. Sarkeesian canceled after officials were unable to make sure there would be no concealed weapons at her speech. Utah law allows for concealed carry with a permit. To be clear: I didn't cancel my USU talk because of terrorist threats, I canceled because I didn’t feel the security measures were adequate. 
 
 Though the threat on Sarkeesian's speech was almost certainly the work of a disaffected, unaffiliated troll, it plays into a larger trend involving the critic — she does pretty much anything, and angry threats, often from self-described "gamers," follow. Artist, programmer, and game designer   noted the irony here: 1999: gamers demand we stop blaming school shootings on videogames. 2014: gamers threaten a school shooting because videogames. 
 
 Kiai makes a devastating point. Much of modern gaming activism grew out of efforts to stop the demonization of video games in the wake of school shootings in the 1990s. But as a result of this, gaming activists now tend to see   criticism of gaming as a threat of their hobby being censored or even banned. And when this combines with feminist critics offering even the mildest of criticism of how the industry treats female characters, it's a recipe for hateful misogyny and awful behavior.

Neil Patrick Harris will host the 2015 Academy Awards
Beloved blonde actor and award show host Neil Patrick Harris will host the 2015 Oscars on February 22. Harris announced the gig , with this video saying he was happy to cross hosting the Oscars off of his "bucket list."   Hosting any awards show is a privilege, but the Academy Awards are the Major Leagues of hosting. The host has to keep energy up for viewers in person and on screens around America. Few can do it well. Harris's jokes will be scrutinized. His shtick will be analyzed endlessly by dozens of TV critics who will never find anybody as good at hosting as their sepia-toned memories of that time Billy Crystal dressed like Hannibal Lecter. That said, Harris has plenty of hosting experience.  And if we're lucky, maybe he'll do something like this. Get our newsletter in your inbox twice a week.

Peter Pan is white-washing Tiger Lily. Again.
Peter Pan is the children's story of the moment. Allison Williams is about to perform a  , and Warner Brother just released the first trailer for its upcoming live-action adaption titled  Unlike the NBC version, which cast  who is part Cherokee, to play Tiger Lily,  cast Rooney Mara, who is white, to play the Native American character. Tiger Lily, according to the original  is a fierce Native American warrior who "staves off the altar with a hatchet." She is pointedly not an emerald-eyed, fair-skinned beauty like Rooney Mara. Hollywood already has so few roles for people of color that   over this role — one that is an obvious place to add diversity — went again to a white woman. Now that the trailer has arrived and revealed just how odd it looks to have Mara playing the part, the issue has been driven home all over again. Twitter responded with anger: Something’s odd about this new Peter   movie, but I just can’t put my finger on it.

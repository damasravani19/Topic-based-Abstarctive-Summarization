Without Clair Huxtable, there would be no Olivia Pope
Among the many inaccuracies and indignities in Alessandra Stanley's   on Shonda Rhimes, a line about Clair Huxtable caught my attention. Stanley's central thesis is that Rhimes has shattered some "angry black woman" glass ceiling in Hollywood, carving  s Olivia Pope and the main character of  ,  Rhimes was as shocked as any of us to find out that she and her characters are angry black women. (Her white, oft-angry female characters are just "women," apparently.) To prove this, Stanley compared Rhimes's black female leads to black women on TV in the '70s and '80s — "bossy, sassy, salt-of-the earth" types like Esther Rolle's Florida character (of   and  ). She added that Rhimes' leading women "certainly are not as benign and reassuring as Clair Huxtable, the serene, elegant wife, mother and dedicated lawyer on  ." This made me wonder if Stanley had ever even seen  , let alone  . Clair Huxtable was not benign and reassuring. She was a badass partner in a law firm! And she taught a million young women (admittedly, through the unrealistic lens of a network sitcom) that pursuing such a demanding career and having a family were not mutually exclusive. She taught me about feminism before I knew what it was. As Clair, the brilliant Phylicia Rashad ranted frequently and famously, just like Rhimes has all of her "angry black women" characters do. She was always the smartest person in the room. If Olivia Pope were a real person, she would have been inspired by Clair Huxtable. On the 30th anniversary of  's premiere, it's baffling that such an obvious connection went unnoticed. It was one of many points missed in an article that thoroughly bungled issues of race, gender, and basic TV history. For an example of Clair's "benign and reassuring" presence, check out the video above, in which she sets her foolish future son-in-law, Elvin, straight on gender roles.

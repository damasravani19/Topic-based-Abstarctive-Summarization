Nielsen admits its past six months of TV ratings are wrong
Nielsen, the company that calculates the ratings networks and advertisers use to set advertising rates for television shows, found a mistake in its calculations Monday that calls into question all of the numbers it has reported since March.  "Nielsen is committed to upholding the highest standards of television audience measurement and data processing," the statement reads. Nielsen will remain the standard for television ratings for the foreseeable future, as no one can yet agree on a viable alternative.

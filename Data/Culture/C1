Some of you are lying about going to church
Raise your hand if you go to church.   
 This inflated sense of church attendance hasn't really changed much in the past few years. The Public Religion Research Institute recently confirmed that people fib about going to church. In a   published in May 2014 — humorously titled "I Know What You Did Last Sunday" — PRRI wrote that "every subgroup of Americans inflates their levels of religious participation." Here's a chart breaking down how different religious groups responded.   
 So what gives? Why are all these religious people lying? Is the trend in religious overreporting similar to the I-Work-Out phenomenon, when most of us check off that box at the doctor's office alleging we work out "4-7 days a week," when really the only energy we've exerted over the last month was during that one episode of  when we lunged at the television. Like the overreporting of church attendance in North America, the overreporting of prayer in the Muslim world is strongly associated with the individual's sense of what is central to his or her self-concept. The respondent interprets the conventional survey question about prayer pragmatically rather than semantically, allowing the question to become one about the respondent's identity, rather than actual behavior. In other words, when a religious person is asked, "Do you do religious stuff?" the question she actually hears is, "Are you the   who does religious stuff?"
